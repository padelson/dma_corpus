Section 2.10 _Exchange Procedures for Avago Ordinary Shares_.

(a) At or immediately after the Avago Effective Time, Avago shall cause Holdco
to, and Holdco shall, deposit with the Exchange Agent, acting as exchange
agent and solely for the account and benefit of the former holders of Avago
Ordinary Shares at the Avago Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with
_Section 2.1_, certificates or book entry shares representing the full
number of Holdco Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ in
exchange for outstanding Avago Ordinary Shares (such Holdco Ordinary Shares,
the " _Avago Consideration Fund_ ").

 

(b) Promptly after the Avago Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Avago Effective Time), Avago shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Avago Certificates or Avago Ordinary
Shares held in book entry form (" _Avago Book Entry Shares_ ") whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Avago Scheme Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1_: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Avago Certificates
or transfer of the Avago Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Avago Scheme Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of
transmittal and instructions shall be in a form prepared by Avago prior to the
Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
in connection with the transfer of an Avago Book Entry Share or surrender of
an Avago Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, in each case
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Avago Book
Entry Share or Avago Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Avago Scheme
Consideration, if any, in each case pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_ and _Section 3.9_, and the Avago Book Entry Share so
transferred 

 



31  or Avago Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid to holders of Avago Book Entry Shares or Avago
Certificates in connection with, or accrued on, the Avago Scheme
Consideration. If any Avago Scheme Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than a Person in whose name the Avago Book Entry Share transferred or
Avago Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be
a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
payment of the Avago Scheme Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Avago Book Entry Share transferred or Avago
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(c) At and after the Avago Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
register of transfer of Avago of Avago Ordinary Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Avago Effective Time. If, after the Avago Effective
Time, Avago Certificates or Avago Book Entry Shares are presented to Holdco,
Avago or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Avago Scheme Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ ,
except as otherwise provided by Law.

(d) Any portion of the Avago Consideration Fund that remains unclaimed by the
former holders of Avago Common Shares one (1) year after the Avago Effective
Time shall be delivered to Holdco. Any holders of Avago Certificates or Avago
Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
with respect to such Avago Certificates or Avago Book Entry Shares shall
thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim for the Avago Scheme
Consideration in respect thereof.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of Avago Scheme Consideration
from the Avago Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Avago
Certificate or Avago Book Entry Share shall not have been surrendered or
transferred prior to the date on which any Avago Scheme Consideration in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any Avago Scheme Consideration
in respect of such Avago Certificate or Avago Book Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Holdco, and any
holder of such Avago Certificate or Avago Book Entry Share who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ with respect thereto shall
thereafter look only to Holdco for payment of their claim for Avago Scheme
Consideration in respect thereof.

(f) If any Avago Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Holdco and the Exchange Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Avago Certificate,
the Avago Scheme Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of
such Avago Certificate pursuant to this  _Article II_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Holdco may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Avago Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount
as Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Holdco, the Avago Parties or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Avago
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



32 (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco Ordinary Shares
with a record date after the Avago Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any Avago Certificate or Avago Book Entry Share formerly representing Avago
Ordinary Shares until the surrender of such Avago Certificate or Avago Book
Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Avago Certificate or Avago Book Entry Share,
there shall be paid to the holder of the Holdco Ordinary Shares issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Avago
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Holdco Ordinary
Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Avago Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to Holdco Ordinary Shares.

then such Unit Electing Share shall remain outstanding as one Class B Common

35 Section 3.4 _Exercise of Election by Broadcom Shareholders_.

 

(a) Prior to the Broadcom Effective Times, Avago will designate a nationally-
recognized U.S. financial institution reasonably acceptable to Broadcom to
act as exchange agent in the Transactions and the Avago Scheme (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). Broadcom, Avago and Holdco shall enter into an exchange
agent agreement with the Exchange Agent setting forth the
duties responsibilities and obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with
the terms of this Agreement and the Exchange Agent will administer the
Election process described in this _Section 3.4_ and the process described
in  _Section 3.5_. All elections in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ ("
_Elections_ ") will be made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually
acceptable to Broadcom and Avago (each a " _Form of Election_ " and
collectively, " _Forms of Election_ "); _provided_ , that, in any event, the
Form of Election shall include (a) a representation by any holder of a Unit
Electing Share that such holder is not a party to and does not otherwise
participate, directly or indirectly, in any Hedging Transaction (as defined in
the Partnership Agreement), and (b) an acknowledgement that any such holder
shall, upon accepting Units, be deemed, by virtue of acceptance of such Units
and without any further action on such holders part, to have executed the
Partnership Agreement and agreed to the rights, privileges, restrictions and
conditions of the Units and to comply with the terms and restrictions of
the Partnership Agreement. Avago shall deliver via mail, facsimile or other
means of electronic transmission Forms of Election, together with a copy of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in connection with the Broadcom Shareholder
Meeting, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the satisfaction of
each of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ (Shareholder Approval),
_Section 7.1(c)_ (Antitrust), _Section 7.1(d)_ (Registration Statement), 
_Section 7.1(e)_ (Nasdaq Listing) and _Section 7.1(f)_ (CFIUS) (the "
_Election Mailing Date_ "), to each holder of record of Broadcom Common Shares
as of the close of the fifth Business Day prior to the Election Mailing Date
(the " _Election Record Date_ "). To the extent practicable, the Form of
Election will permit each holder that beneficially owns Broadcom Common
Shares, in more than one name or account, to specify (through appropriate
and customary documentation and instructions) how to allocate the cash paid,
the Holdco Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Cash/Stock Merger, and the
Units to be issued in the Unit Merger among the various accounts that such
holder beneficially owns. Avago and Broadcom will make available one or more
Forms of Election as may be reasonably requested by any Person who becomes a
holder (or beneficial owner) of Broadcom Common Shares between the Election
Record Date and the close of business on the day prior to the Election
Deadline.

(b) A Form of Election must be properly completed, signed, and actually
received by the Exchange Agent not later than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on
the date five (5) Business Days prior to Avagos good faith estimate of the
Broadcom Effective Times or such other date as may be mutually agreed to by
Avago and Broadcom (such time hereinafter referred to as the " _Election
Deadline_ ") in order to be effective; _provided_ , that Avago shall publish a
press release announcing the Election Deadline at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Election Deadline; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Election Deadline shall not be earlier than twenty (20) Business Days after
the Election Mailing Date. Any Broadcom Common Shares for which the record
holder has not, prior to the Election Deadline, properly submitted a properly
completed Form of Election to the Exchange Agent will be deemed to be a Non-
Electing Share. Any record holder of Broadcom Common Shares who has made an
Election may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change such holders
Election by submitting a revised Form of

 



36  Election, properly completed, that is received by the Exchange Agent prior
to the Election Deadline. After an Election has been validly made, such
Election must be revoked prior to any subsequent transfer of the Broadcom
Common Shares as to which such Election related, and any subsequent transfer
of Broadcom Common Shares as to which such Election related shall
automatically revoke such Election. In addition, all Forms of Election
will automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by
Avago and Broadcom that this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_. The Election Deadline shall only be extended by mutual
agreement of Avago and Broadcom, and the parties shall promptly make a public
announcement of any such agreement.

(c) The Exchange Agent will have the discretion to determine whether Forms of
Election have been properly completed, signed, and timely submitted or to
disregard defects in forms. Any such determination of the Exchange Agent will
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The Exchange Agent will not
be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a Form of
Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. Any Broadcom Common Shares with
respect to which a holder is deemed to have not submitted a valid
Election prior to the Election Deadline will be deemed to be a Non-Electing
Share.

(d) The Exchange Agent will make all the computations contemplated by this
_Section 3.4_, including the determination of the number of Cash Electing
Shares, Stock Electing Shares, Unit Electing Shares and Non-Electing Shares,
and all such computations will be conclusive and binding on the former
holders of Broadcom Common Shares absent manifest error. The Exchange Agent
may, with the agreement of Avago and Broadcoms approval (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make such rules as
are consistent with this _Section 3.4_ for the implementation of the
procedures provided for herein as are necessary or desirable to effect fully
such procedures.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
Avago will instruct the Exchange Agent to return all Broadcom Common Shares
submitted or transferred to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section
3.4_.

Section 3.5  _Exchange Procedures for Broadcom Common Shares_.

(a) At or immediately after the Cash/Stock Effective Time, Avago shall
cause Holdco and New LP to respectively deposit with the Exchange Agent,
acting as exchange agent and solely for the account and benefit of the former
holders of Broadcom Common Shares at the Broadcom Effective Times, for
exchange in accordance with this  _Article III_ , certificates or book entry
shares representing the full number of Holdco Ordinary Shares and Units
issuable pursuant to this _Article III_ in exchange for outstanding Broadcom
Common Shares. At or immediately after the Broadcom Effective Times, Avago
shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all of the
cash necessary to pay the aggregate amount of the Broadcom Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article III_ , including
the aggregate amount of the Holdco Ordinary Shares and Units and the
Aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article III_ (such
Holdco Ordinary Shares, Units and Aggregate Cash Consideration, the "
_Consideration Fund_ "). In addition, Avago shall make available as necessary
cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section 3.3_. In the event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient
to pay the aggregate amount of the

 



37  Broadcom Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Transactions,
including any deficiency in (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii) the
number of Holdco Ordinary Shares and Units issuable in connection with the
Transactions, Avago shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered,
additional funds, Holdco Ordinary Shares and/or Units to the Exchange Agent,
in each case in an amount that is equal to such deficiency required to make
such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Broadcom Effective Times (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the Effective Times), Avago shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Broadcom Certificates or Book Entry
Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Broadcom
Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 3.1_: (i) a letter of
transmittal, in customary form, that shall specify that delivery of such
Broadcom Certificates or transfer of such Book Entry Shares shall be deemed to
have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Broadcom Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Broadcom Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of
the Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Broadcom Certificates or transfer of the Book
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Broadcom Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed to by Broadcom and Avago and prepared prior
to the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in
connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a Broadcom
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, in each case together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry Share or Broadcom
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Broadcom Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares, if any, in each case pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_ , and the Book Entry Share so
transferred or Broadcom Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or
Broadcom Certificates in connection with, or accrued on, the Broadcom Merger
Consideration or any cash paid in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares. If any Broadcom Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than a Person in whose name the Book Entry Share transferred or Broadcom
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
payment of the Broadcom Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Book Entry Share transferred or Broadcom Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) Cash in the Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Avago; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall be
in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in
excess of the amounts payable to holders of Broadcom Common Shares prior to
the Cash/Stock Merger and Unit Merger shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Avago and shall be paid to Avago. No investment of the
Consideration Fund shall relieve the Avago Parties or the Exchange Agent from
promptly making the payments required by this 

 



38   _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment, Avago
shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Broadcom Common Shares at the Broadcom Effective
Times in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to
be part of the Consideration Fund.

 

(d) At and after the Cash/Stock Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Broadcom of Broadcom Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Cash/Stock Effective Time. If, after the
Broadcom Effective Time, Broadcom Certificates or Book Entry Shares are
presented to Holdco, the Broadcom Surviving Corporation, Avago or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Broadcom
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ , except as provided in
_Section 3.6_ or as otherwise provided by Law.

 

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former holders of Broadcom
Common Shares one (1) year after the Broadcom Effective Times shall be
delivered to Avago. Any holders of Broadcom Certificates or Book Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to
such Broadcom Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to
Avago for payment of their claim for Broadcom Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of Broadcom
Merger Consideration from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Broadcom Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any Broadcom
Merger Consideration in respect of such Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Avago, and any holder of such Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry Share who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall
thereafter look only to Avago for payment of their claim for Broadcom Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

(g) If any Broadcom Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Holdco and the Exchange Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Broadcom
Certificate, the Broadcom Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled in respect of such Broadcom Certificate pursuant to this  _Article
III_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Broadcom Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Holdco may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Holdco, the Avago Parties or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Broadcom Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed. 

 



39 (h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdco Ordinary Shares
or Units of New LP with a record date after the Broadcom Effective Times
shall be paid to the holder of any Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry Share
formerly representing Broadcom Common Shares, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
3.3_, until the surrender of such Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry Share in
accordance with this _Article III_. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Broadcom Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall
be paid to the holder of the Holdco Ordinary Shares or Units of New LP issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Holdco Ordinary Share or
Unit of New LP to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_ and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Broadcom Effective Times theretofore paid with respect to such whole Holdco
Ordinary Shares or Units of New LP and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Broadcom Effective Times but prior to such surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to Holdco Ordinary
Shares or Units of New LP.

Section 3.6 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Dissenting Shares will not
be converted into the right to receive that portion of the Broadcom Merger
Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such Broadcom Common Shares
after the Broadcom Effective Times, but will instead be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a
Dissenting Shareholder withdraws such holders demand for purchase of
such Dissenting Shares for fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 of the
CGCL or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal, then, as of the
Broadcom Effective Times or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or
ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares will
cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be converted into the right to receive,
and will be exchangeable for, the Broadcom Merger Consideration into which
such Dissenting Shares would have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_
as if such shares were Cash Electing Shares. Each Dissenting Shareholder who,
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair
market value of the Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor (but only
after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant
to such provisions). Broadcom shall give Avago (a) prompt notice of any
demands received by Broadcom for the purchase of Broadcom Common Shares
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and/or payment in respect thereof,
attempted written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and received by Broadcom relating
to shareholders demands for the purchase of Broadcom Common Shares pursuant
to Chapter 13 of the CGCL with respect to the Cash/Stock Merger and the Unit
Merger, and (b) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any exercise of such rights under Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
_provided_ , that Broadcom shall direct and control any such negotiations and
proceedings. Except as required by applicable Law or pursuant to an order,
decree or ruling of a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Broadcom,
Broadcom shall not (and shall not agree to), without the prior written consent
of Avago, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to
settle, any such demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand or to timely take any other action for the purchase
of Broadcom Common Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

 



40 Section 3.7 _Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units; and
Performance Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) At the Cash/Stock Effective Time, each outstanding and unvested Broadcom
Stock Option (except as set forth in _Section 3.7(d)_ of the Broadcom
Disclosure Schedule) that is held by an individual who is eligible to be
included on a registration statement filed by Holdco on Form S-8 shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and
converted into an option to purchase that number of Holdco Ordinary Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the sum of (x) the product
of (A) the number of Broadcom Common Shares subject to such Broadcom Stock
Option and (B) the Normalized Stock Consideration and (y) the product of (A)
the number of Broadcom Common Shares subject to such Broadcom Stock Option and
(B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Normalized Cash Consideration
by (ii) the Avago Measurement Price, at an exercise price per Holdco Ordinary
Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (1) the aggregate exercise price for the Broadcom Common Shares
subject to such Broadcom Stock Option by (2) the aggregate number of Holdco
Ordinary Shares to be subject to such Broadcom Stock Option after giving
effect to the adjustments in this _Section 3.7(a)_ (each, as so adjusted, a
" _Broadcom Converted Holdco Option_ "). All rounding described in this
_Section 3.7(a)_ shall be done on an aggregate basis.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Broadcom Converted Holdco Options shall
have the same vesting schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as
provided in any applicable Broadcom Equity Plan, Benefit Plan, or Benefit
Agreement) as the Broadcom Stock Options and otherwise shall have the same
terms and conditions as such Broadcom Stock Options; _provided_ , that Holdco
shall convert Broadcom Stock Options into Broadcom Converted Holdco Options
in such a manner as to ensure that the Broadcom Converted Holdco Options are
not subject to Section 409A of the Code as a result of the assumption and
conversion. After such assumption and conversion, the Broadcom Converted
Holdco Options shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the
Broadcom Equity Plan, grant agreements under which the Broadcom Stock Options
were originally issued, and any other applicable Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement (including any applicable change in control or other accelerated
vesting provisions).

(c) At the Cash/Stock Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Broadcom
Stock Option shall, without any further action on the part of any holder
thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to the positive difference, if any, calculated by
subtracting the aggregate exercise price of such Broadcom Stock Option from
the product of the number of vested shares subject to such Broadcom Stock
Option multiplied by the Equity Award Consideration (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable
Law to be withheld). Following the Cash/Stock Effective Time, any such
cancelled Broadcom Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable for Broadcom
Common Shares and shall entitle the holder of such Broadcom Stock Option to
only the payment described in this _Section 3.7(c)_, which shall be made by
the Broadcom Surviving Corporation or Holdco as of, or within two (2) Business
Days following, the Cash/Stock Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt,
any vested Broadcom Stock Option that is an Underwater Option shall be
cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the Broadcom Effective
Time and the holder of such Underwater Option shall have no further rights
with respect thereto.

 



41 (d) At the Cash/Stock Effective Time, by virtue of the Cash/Stock Merger, each
unvested Broadcom Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Cash/Stock Effective Time (except as set forth on _Section 3.7(d)_ of the
Broadcom Disclosure Schedule) that is held by an individual who is eligible to
be included on a registration statement filed by Holdco on Form S-8 shall be
converted into an award consisting of that number of restricted share units of
Holdco Ordinary Shares (" _Converted RSUs_ ") equal to the sum of (x) the
product of (A) the number of Broadcom Common Shares subject to such Broadcom
Restricted Stock Units and (B) the Normalized Stock Consideration and (y) the
product of (A) the number of Broadcom Common Shares subject to such
Broadcom Restricted Stock Units and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
the Normalized Cash Consideration, by (ii) the Avago Measurement Price
(rounded down to the nearest whole share). The Converted RSUs shall have the
same vesting schedule (including any acceleration of vesting as provided in
any applicable Broadcom Equity Plan, Benefit Plan, or Benefit Agreement) as
the Broadcom Restricted Stock Units and otherwise shall have the same terms
and conditions as such Broadcom Restricted Stock Units; _provided_ , that
Holdco shall convert Broadcom Restricted Stock Units into Converted RSUs in
such a manner as to ensure that the Converted RSUs are not subject to, or are
compliant with, Section 409A of the Code as a result of the assumption and
conversion. Subject to applicable Law, any Converted RSUs issued pursuant to
this _Section 3.7(d)_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such Broadcom Restricted Stock Units (including any
applicable change in control or other accelerated vesting provisions, and this
transaction shall constitute a change in control for all relevant provisions).

 

(e) At the Cash/Stock Effective Time, each outstanding and vested Broadcom
Restricted Stock Unit (including any Broadcom Restricted Stock Unit that
becomes vested as a result (alone or in combination with another event) of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement) shall, without any further action
on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (subject to any applicable
withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be
withheld) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Broadcom Common Shares subject to such Broadcom Restricted Stock Unit
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Consideration. The payment described in
this _Section 3.7(e)_ shall be made by the Broadcom Surviving Corporation as
of, or within two (2) Business Days, the Broadcom Effective Times; _provided_
, that such payment shall be made at such other time or times following the
Broadcom Effective Times consistent with the terms of the Broadcom Restricted
Stock Unit to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of additional
income tax under Section 409A of the Code.

(f) Prior to the Cash/Stock Effective Time, Broadcom shall take all actions
necessary to effectuate the provisions set forth in this _Section 3.7_;
_provided_ , that no action taken by Broadcom shall be required to be
irrevocable until immediately prior to the Cash/Stock Effective Time. The
parties shall, to the extent necessary minimize the tax impact to holders of
Broadcom Stock Options and Broadcom Restricted Stock Units of the provisions
set forth in this _Section 3.7_, cooperate in good faith prior to the
Cash/Stock Effective Time to develop a mechanism with respect to Broadcom
Stock Options and Broadcom Restricted Stock Units held by individuals subject
to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the United States.

 



42 Section 3.8 _Avago Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Avago Effective Time, each outstanding Avago Share Option shall,
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and
converted into an option to purchase the same number of Holdco Ordinary Shares
as the number of Avago Ordinary Shares subject to such Avago Share Option at
the same exercise price per Holdco Ordinary Share as the per share exercise
price for the Avago Ordinary Shares subject to such Avago Share Option (each,
as so adjusted, an " _Avago Converted Holdco Option_ "). Subject to applicable
Law, the Avago Converted Holdco Options shall have the same vesting
schedule (including any applicable change in control or other accelerated
vesting provisions) as the Avago Share Options and otherwise shall have the
same terms and conditions as such Avago Share Options. After such assumption
and conversion, the Avago Converted Holdco Options shall be subject to all of
the terms and conditions of the Avago Equity Plans, grant agreements under
which the Avago Share Options were originally issued, and any other applicable
benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (including any applicable change in
control or other accelerated vesting provisions, _provided_ that in no event
shall this transaction constitute a change in control for the purposes of such
provisions).

 

(b) At the Avago Effective Time, each Avago RSU Award outstanding immediately
prior to the Avago Effective Time shall be converted into an award consisting
of that number of restricted share units of Holdco Ordinary Shares ("
_Converted Holdco RSUs_ ") equal to the number of Avago Ordinary Shares
subject to such Avago RSU Award. The Converted Holdco RSUs shall have
the same vesting schedule (including any applicable change in control or
other accelerated vesting provisions) as the Avago RSU Awards and otherwise
shall have the same terms and conditions as such Avago RSU Awards. Subject to
applicable Law, any Converted Holdco RSUs issued pursuant to this _Section
3.9(b)_ shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to such Avago RSU Awards (including any applicable change in control or other
accelerated vesting provisions, _provided_ , that in no event shall this
transaction constitute a change in control for the purposes of such
provisions).

 

(c) Prior to the Avago Effective Time, Avago shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the provisions set forth in this  _Section 3.9_; _provided_ ,
that no action taken by Avago shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Avago Effective Time. The parties shall, to the
extent necessary to minimize the tax impact to holders of Avago Share Options
and Avago RSU Awards of the provisions set forth in this _Section 3.9,_
cooperate in good faith prior to the Avago Effective Time to develop a
mechanism with respect to Avago Share Options and Avago RSU Awards held
by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than
the United States.

Section 3.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Avago Parties, Broadcom and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts, if any, as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Avago Parties, Broadcom or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted
by the Avago Parties, Broadcom or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



43 ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BROADCOM_

the date of this Agreement (but (i) without giving effect to any amendment
thereof filed with, or furnished to, the SEC on or after the date of this
Agreement and (ii) excluding any disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking
statements" or other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-
looking in nature), but only to the extent such Broadcom SEC Reports or such
furnished items are publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering
Analysis and Retrieval System (it being understood that this clause (ii) shall
not be applicable to _Section 4.2_) or (b) in the Broadcom Disclosure
Schedule, Broadcom represents and warrants to the Avago Parties as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization_. 

(a) Broadcom is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the CGCL, and has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as it is currently being conducted. Broadcom is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction (to the
extent such concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) in which the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Broadcom Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Broadcom Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of Broadcoms material Subsidiaries, as of the date
of this Agreement. Each such Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing

its organization or formation, as applicable, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as it is currently being conducted.

 

(c) Broadcom has made available to Avago copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws, including all amendments thereto through the

Common Shares, 400,000,000 Class B Common Shares and 6,432,161 shares of
Broadcom Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Broadcom Preferred

From the close of business on May 26, 2015 until the date of this Agreement,
no Broadcom Common Shares or Broadcom Preferred Shares have been issued
except for (i) Class A Common Shares issued upon conversion of Class B Common
Shares or (ii) Class A Common Shares issued pursuant to the ESPP, upon the
exercise of Broadcom Stock Options or upon the settlement of Broadcom

duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of
preemptive rights. All of the rights granted and not yet exercised to
subscribe for shares of Broadcoms capital stock are duly authorized and free
of preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement, other than (i)
pursuant to Broadcom Equity Plans or the ESPP or (ii) the right of the
holders of Class B Common Shares to convert such shares into Class A Common
Shares, there are no existing (A) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or
other rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any
character obligating Broadcom or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or

Shares that are subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions. _Section
4.2(b)_ of the Broadcom Disclosure Schedule contains, as of May 26, 2015, a
complete and correct list of each outstanding Broadcom Stock Option, Broadcom
Restricted Stock Unit and Broadcom Performance-Based Unit, including the date
of grant, the date of expiration, the number of Class A Common Shares subject
to such award as of the date of this Agreement, exercise price, vesting
schedule (including the number of vested and unvested shares as of the date
of this Agreement), the number of Class A Common Shares vested and unvested as
of the date of this Agreement and whether such award is an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.

(c) All of the issued Equity Interests of each of Broadcoms Subsidiaries are
validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required under the applicable
Charter Documents) and nonassessable (to the extent that such concept is
applicable) and all such shares other than directors qualifying shares are
owned of record and beneficially, directly or indirectly, by Broadcom free
and clear of all material Liens, pledges, security interests or other
encumbrances. No Subsidiary of Broadcom has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions,

commitments, rights agreements or other similar agreements, except, in each
case, to or with Broadcom or any other Subsidiary of Broadcom. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of any Subsidiary of Broadcom
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its share capital or other
equity interests.

(d) Neither Broadcom nor any of its Subsidiaries own any material interest or
investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other entity (other than an interest or investment in a
Subsidiary of Broadcom), which interest or investment is material to Broadcom
or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) Neither Broadcom nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or is obligated
to make any material future investment in or capital contribution to any

enforceability or Broadcoms ownership of, such Intellectual Property; except

contemplated hereby will not require Broadcom or its Subsidiaries to (i)
grant any license to any third party under material Intellectual Property of

Broadcom or its Subsidiaries, in each case, to any third party under any

not the allocation or sharing of Taxes.

(e) There are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Broadcom or any
of its Subsidiaries that are not provided for in the Broadcom SEC Reports,
except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and Liens for Taxes that are

Broadcom, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Broadcom Material Adverse Effect.

 

(f) Neither Broadcom nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor, to

possible failure to satisfy the "substantiality test" as defined in Treasury

Section 5.14 _Financing_. Avago or Holdco, as applicable, has delivered to

this Agreement from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Bank
of America, N.A., Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Barclays Bank
PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citibank, N.A., Citicorp USA, Inc.,
and Citicorp North America, Inc. (together, as they may be amended, modified
or replaced in accordance with _Section 6.15_,

 



68  the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") to provide debt financing in an aggregate
amount set forth therein and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of
the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified in any manner and no such amendment or modification of the Debt
Commitment Letter is contemplated as of the date of this Agreement. The
commitment contained in the Debt Commitment Letter has not been terminated,
reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, as of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Avago and Holdco, no such termination,
reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated. Avago or Holdco, as
applicable, has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees and
amounts in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of Avago and Holdco, as applicable, and, to
the Knowledge of Avago, the other parties thereto, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies generally
and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any Proceeding therefor may be brought. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount (or any
portion) of the Debt Financing, including any condition relating to the
availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision, other
than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the
satisfaction of the Avago Parties conditions to Closing, the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ to the extent
necessary to satisfy the condition in _Section 7.2(a)_ and performance by
Broadcom of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent necessary to
satisfy the condition in  _Section 7.2(b)_, the net proceeds contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter, together with available cash on hand held by
Avago, Broadcom and their respective Subsidiaries, will, in the aggregate, be
sufficient for Holdco and Avago to pay all of the cash amounts required to be
provided by Avago or Holdco, as applicable, for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts payable in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, all related fees and
expenses required to be paid on or prior to the date of the consummation of
the Transactions, and the funds to be provided by (or on behalf of) Avago and
the other Avago Parties to Broadcom to enable Broadcom (together with
the cash on hand held by Broadcom and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof) to
fund the repayment or refinancing of the Broadcom Notes and the Broadcom
Credit Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters
or other agreements, contracts or written arrangements of any kind relating
to the Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the availability of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter other than as expressly
set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
delivered to Broadcom prior to the execution of this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach by Avago or Holdco or, to the Knowledge of Avago or Holdco,
any other party thereto, under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter and (ii) neither Avago or Holdco has any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied by Avago or Holdco,
as applicable, on a timely basis or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Avago or Holdco, as applicable, on the date of the
Closing. Notwithstanding

 



69  anything to the contrary contained herein, Broadcom agrees that a breach of
this representation and warranty shall not result in the failure of a
condition precedent to Broadcoms obligations under this Agreement, if
(notwithstanding such breach) Avago is willing and able to consummate the
Transactions on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c) To the Knowledge of Avago, there are no conditions or incidents, including

Subsidiaries under Environmental Law.

sheet of Avago and its consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with

70 Section 5.17 _Solvency_. Avago is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Broadcom or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (w) that Broadcom is Solvent
immediately prior to Closing (without giving effect to the Debt Financing or
the other transactions contemplated herein), (x) satisfaction of the
conditions to the Avago Parties obligations to consummate the Transactions as
set forth herein, (y) the reasonableness of any estimates, projections or
forecasts of Broadcom and its Subsidiaries provided to Avago and that such
estimates, projections or forecasts have been prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions that were reasonable and (z) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Broadcom set forth in  _Article IV_ in all
material respects (but without giving effect to any materiality or Broadcom
Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein), immediately
following the Closing after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Avago will be Solvent. As used herein, " _Solvent_ " means
with respect to any Person on a particular date, that on such date (a) the
fair value of the property of such Person is greater than the total amount
of liabilities, including, contingent liabilities, of such Person, (b) the
present fair salable value of the assets of such Person is not less than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person on
its debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person has not
incurred, and does not intend to incur, debts or liabilities beyond such
Persons ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature and (d) such
Person is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to
engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons property would
constitute an unreasonably small capital. The amount of contingent liabilities
at any time shall be computed under this  _Section 5.17_ as the amount that,
in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time,
represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or
matured liability.

in the share capital of Avago necessary to approve and resolve upon the Avago
Scheme is the affirmative vote at Avago Shareholder Meeting by a majority in

majority holding not less than seventy-five percent (75%) in value of the
Avago Ordinary Shares voted at the Avago Shareholder Meeting (the " _Avago
Shareholder Approval_ "). The only vote of holders of any class of shares in
the share capital of Holdco necessary to allot and issue Holdco Ordinary
Shares pursuant to the Transactions and any other transactions contemplated
under this Agreement is the affirmative vote of the Nominee by way of the
Nominee signing a record of the relevant resolutions to approve the issue and

and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors and
employees to, and Broadcom will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Broadcoms and its Subsidiaries respective other Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Broadcom Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that all confidential or
proprietary information previously furnished to any Third Parties in
connection with such discussions and negotiations be promptly returned or
destroyed. Broadcom acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer,
director or employee of Broadcom or any of its Subsidiaries takes any action
that if taken by Broadcom would be a breach of this _Section 6.3_, the taking

constitute a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 6.3_) by

and their respective officers, directors, employees and other Representatives
may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof,
making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any nonpublic information to, any
Person or Persons (but only after any such Person enters into a customary
confidentiality agreement with Broadcom that contains provisions that in the
aggregate are no less favorable to Broadcom than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality
agreement shall not be required to contain standstill provisions and which
agreement may not provide for an exclusive right to negotiate with Broadcom

sources of financing, if (i) Broadcoms board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Person or Persons have submitted to Broadcom a Broadcom
Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Broadcom Superior Proposal and (ii) Broadcoms board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to participate in such discussions or negotiations, furnish such
information, enter into any agreement related to any Broadcom Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of Broadcoms directors under applicable Law.

 

(c) Broadcom will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) (i) notify Avago of the receipt
by Broadcom of any Broadcom Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide Avago with a

board of directors as to whether to provide non-public information with
respect to Broadcom to any Person in response to a Broadcom Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such
determination was reached (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24)
hours after such determination was reached). Broadcom will (x) keep Avago
informed as promptly as practicable with respect to any changes to the
material terms of a Broadcom Acquisition Proposal submitted to Broadcom (and
in any event within forty eight (48) hours following any such changes),
including by providing a copy of all written proposals relating to any
Broadcom Acquisition Proposal, (y) promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) following the provision of any non-public information of

posting such information to an electronic data room), to the extent such
information has not previously been provided or made available to Avago and

determination) notify Avago of any determination by the Broadcom board of
directors that such Broadcom Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Broadcom
Superior Proposal.

or indirectly:

 

(i) (x) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify
or modify, in a manner adverse to the Avago Parties, the Broadcom Board
Recommendation, (y) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt, or recommend, any Broadcom Acquisition Proposal or (z) solely
if a Broadcom Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced, fail to issue
a press release reaffirming the Broadcom Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days following Avagos written request to issue such press release
(any action described in clause (x), (y) or (z) being referred to as a "
_Broadcom Change of Recommendation_ ") or

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
allow Broadcom to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (x)
constituting or relating to, any Broadcom Acquisition Proposal or (y)
requiring Broadcom to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate any of the
Transactions or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case other than a Broadcom Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Broadcom Shareholder Meeting,
Broadcoms board of directors may, (x) in the case of a Broadcom Intervening
Event or with respect to a Broadcom Superior Proposal, which Broadcom Superior
Proposal did not result from a breach of this  _Section 6.3_ by Broadcom or
its Representatives (including any act or omission by any such Representative
which would constitute a breach of this _Section 6.3_ if such act was taken
or omitted to be taken by Broadcom), make a Broadcom Change of Recommendation
or (y) with respect to a Broadcom Superior Proposal, which Broadcom Superior
Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by Broadcom or
its Representatives, approve or recommend a Broadcom Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, and enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Broadcom Superior Proposal
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; _provided_
, that:

(i) Broadcoms board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of Broadcoms directors under applicable Law;

 

(ii) Broadcom notifies Avago at least four (4) Business Days in advance of
taking such action (such four-Business Day period, the " _Broadcom Notice
Period_ ") that Broadcom intends to take such action, which notice must
specify the reasons for taking such action and, in the event of a Broadcom
Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal
(including the identity of the Person making the proposal) and concurrently

 



82  provides a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
Person making such proposal (it being understood that in the event any of the
material terms or conditions of any such proposal are modified during the
Broadcom Notice Period, Broadcom shall as promptly as possible, and in any
event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such modification,
notify Avago of such modification, at which time the Broadcom Notice Period
shall be extended by an additional two (2) Business Days), and in the event of
a Broadcom Intervening Event, a reasonable description of such Broadcom
Intervening Event;

 

(iii) prior to taking such action, Broadcom shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Broadcom Notice Period negotiate with Avago in
good faith (to the extent Avago desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would
obviate the need for Broadcom to take such action; and

 

(iv) Avago shall not have proposed in writing at or prior to the conclusion of
the Broadcom Notice Period any modifications or revisions to the terms of
this Agreement, which revisions shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this
Agreement that would, upon Broadcoms acceptance, be binding on the parties
hereto, and, if applicable, revisions to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Financing Agreements, to provide for terms which the board
of directors of Broadcom determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to cause (x) the
Broadcom Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Broadcom Superior
Proposal or (y) in cases involving a Broadcom Intervening Event, the failure
to make a Broadcom Change of Recommendation with respect to such Broadcom
Intervening Event to be no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of Broadcoms directors under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of
Broadcom from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of Broadcom a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and
(ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of Broadcom that the board of
directors of Broadcom determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure
referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to a Broadcom
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Broadcom Change of
Recommendation unless (x) the board of directors of Broadcom expressly
reaffirms the Broadcom Board Recommendation in such disclosure or (y) such
disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders of
Broadcom pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Broadcom board of directors to make a Broadcom Change of
Recommendation or take any of the actions referred to in clauses (x) or (y) of
_Section 6.3(e)_, except, in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section
6.3(e)_.

Avagos board of directors may, (x) in the case of an Avago Intervening Event
or with respect to an Avago Superior Proposal, which Avago Superior Proposal
did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by Avago or its
Representatives, make an Avago Change of Recommendation or (y) with respect
to an Avago Superior Proposal, which Avago Superior Proposal did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by Avago or its Representatives
(including any act or omission by any such Representative which would

be taken by Avago), approve or recommend an Avago Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, and enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Avago Superior Proposal
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; _provided_
, that:

 

(i) Avagos board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Avagos
directors under applicable Law;

 

(ii) Avago notifies Broadcom at least four (4) Business Days in advance of
taking such action (such four-Business Day period, the " _Avago Notice
Period_ ") that Avago intends to take such action, which notice must specify
the reasons for taking such action and, in the event of an Avago Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such proposal (including the
identity of the Person making the proposal) and concurrently provides a copy
of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such
proposal (it being understood that in the event any of the material terms or
conditions of any such proposal are modified during the Avago Notice Period,
Avago shall as promptly as possible, and in any event no later than twenty-
four (24) hours after receipt of such modification, notify Broadcom of
such modification, at which time the Avago Notice Period shall be extended by
an additional two (2) Business Days), and in the event of an Avago Intervening
Event, a reasonable description of such Avago Intervening Event;

 

(iii) prior to taking such action, Avago shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Avago Notice Period negotiate with Broadcom in
good faith (to the extent Broadcom desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner
that would obviate the need for Avago to take such action; and

 

(iv) Broadcom shall not have proposed in writing at or prior to the conclusion
of the Avago Notice Period any modifications or revisions to the terms of
this Agreement, which revisions shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this
Agreement that would, upon Avagos acceptance, be binding on the parties
hereto, and, if applicable, revisions to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Financing Agreements, to provide for terms which the board
of directors of Avago determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to cause (x) the Avago
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute an Avago Superior Proposal or (y)
in cases involving an Avago Intervening Event, the failure to make an Avago
Change of Recommendation with respect to such Avago Intervening Event to be no
longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Avagos directors under
applicable Law.

 



86 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of Avago

contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making
any disclosure to the shareholders of Avago that the board of directors of
Avago determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure referred to in clauses (i)
or (ii) that relates to an Avago Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an
Avago Change of Recommendation unless (x) the board of directors of Avago
expressly reaffirms the Avago Board Recommendation in such disclosure or (y)
such disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders
of Avago pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 6.4(f)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Avago board of directors to make an Avago Change of Recommendation
or take any of the actions referred to in clauses (x) or (y) of _Section
6.4(e)_, except, in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section 6.4(e)_.

after the Effective Times, Holdco agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Broadcom Surviving Corporation) to provide each Employee
with (i) a base salary or wage rate (as applicable) that is no less favorable
to each Employee than in effect for such Employee immediately prior to the

87 (d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Holdco or its Subsidiaries (including Avago and the

Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent Broadcom provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Holdco and its Subsidiaries
(including Avago and the Broadcom Surviving Corporation). HoldCo shall use
reasonable efforts to cause each of the applicable Holdco Plans that
provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits
to any Employee to (i) waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent
waived or not included under the corresponding Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide
Employees with credit under the applicable Holdco Plans for amounts paid by
such Employees prior to the Effective Times during the plan year in which the

amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Holdco Plans.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.5_ with respect to employees of Broadcom and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole and exclusive benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other person,

beneficiary thereof in any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement, Foreign Benefit
Plan or Holdco Plans or (ii) to continued employment with Broadcom or any of
its Subsidiaries or Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries (including Avago or the
Broadcom Surviving Corporation). Notwithstanding anything in this _Section

shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan,
Benefit Agreement or Foreign Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plans
of Broadcom or Avago.

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) Broadcom will deliver to

grant set forth therein.

Broadcom with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable
to Avago and Broadcom. Thereafter, neither Broadcom nor Avago (nor any of
their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party

efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any

 



88  such public announcements; _provided_ , that neither Avago nor Broadcom will
be required to obtain the prior approval of or consult with the other party in

") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with

directors (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as provided in Broadcoms Charter
Documents, the Avago Charter or Avagos and Broadcoms respective
Subsidiaries respective Charter Documents or in any agreement between such
DandO Indemnitee and Broadcom, Avago, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors, shall survive the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to

Corporation and Avago as of the Closing to, obtain and fully pay the premium
for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of Broadcoms and Avagos respective existing directors and
officers insurance policies and Broadcoms and Avagos respective existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at

related to any period of time at or prior to the Closing from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Broadcoms and

 



89  Avagos current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
Broadcoms and Avagos existing policies. If Broadcom or the Broadcom
Surviving Corporation and/or Avago for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Closing, (i) each of the Broadcom Surviving
Corporation and Avago, as applicable, shall continue to maintain in effect,
for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with Broadcoms and

current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
Broadcoms and Avagos respective existing policies, or (ii) Holdco will
provide, or cause the Avago and the Broadcom Surviving Corporation to provide,
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing, the DandO
Indemnitees who are insured under Broadcoms or Avagos respective DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Closing from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as Broadcoms or Avagos respective current DandO
Insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of
Broadcom or Avago, respectively, or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Holdco and Avago and the Broadcom Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the annual premium currently paid by Broadcom or Avago, as applicable, for
such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Holdco, Avago or the Broadcom
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing,
for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and the
DandO Indemnitees, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Holdco, Avago and the Broadcom Surviving Corporation.

any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such

Avago Parties shall not permit any amendment, modification or replacement to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter

reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid) or original issue discount (unless (x) the Debt
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) the Avago Parties,
Broadcom or their respective Subsidiaries have a corresponding amount of

or (B) imposes new or additional conditions to the initial funding or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of
the initial Debt Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner that would reasonably be

or prevent the funding in full of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact
the ability of Avago or any other Avago Party to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto, in each case, relating to the funding thereunder ( _provided_
, that Avago and the other Avago Parties may amend or replace the Debt
Commitment Letter to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities so long as such action would not
reasonably be expected to materially delay (taking into account the Marketing
Period) or prevent the Closing or adversely impact Avagos ability to enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter). Avago and the other Avago
Parties shall promptly deliver to Broadcom true and complete copies of any
such amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of this _Section
6.15(a)_, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended or

provide, all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv)
Avago or any other Avago Party receives any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing or (v) Avago or any other Avago Party determines in good faith it

Avago be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if Avago shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to disclose such information in a manner that would not waive
such privilege. Without limiting Avagos or any other Avago Partys other
obligations under this _Section 6.15_, if the commitments with respect to all
or any portion of the Debt Financing expires or is terminated or all or any
portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable or it becomes
reasonably foreseeable that such events will occur, then Avago and the other
Avago Parties shall (x) promptly notify Broadcom of such event and the
reasons therefor, (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to pay
all cash amounts required to paid in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (z) when obtained, provide Broadcom with a copy
of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing,
together with all related fee letters and associated engagement letters (with
only fee amounts and pricing caps redacted).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Avagos and
the other Avago Parties obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition
regarding Avagos, the other Avago Parties or any of their Affiliates
obtaining funds to consummate the Transactions and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of any fees and expenses
and the repayment or refinancing of the Broadcom Notes and the Broadcom Credit
Agreement.

obligation of Broadcom under any agreement, certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Closing, and

will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (the " _IRS Ruling_ "),
(iv) to obtain the opinion of Skadden, dated as of the Closing Date, to the
effect that the Unit Merger should qualify as an "exchange" for which no gain
or loss shall be recognized by holders of Unit Electing Shares pursuant to
Section 721(a) of the Code (other than such gain or loss recognized in
connection with (A) the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional Holdco Ordinary
Shares or Units, (B) any voting rights in Holdco attaching to or associated
with Units or otherwise provided to holders of Units (through the issuance of
any Equity Interests of Holdco, a voting trust or otherwise) or (C) any
expense reimbursement described in Section 4.2 of the Support Agreements) and
(v) to obtain such representations and covenants from the officers of Broadcom
as are reasonably requested from the Avago Parties in connection with Tax
matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided
that such the officers of Broadcom shall not be required to provide a
representation or covenant to the extent that such representation or covenant
would reasonably be expected to adversely impact Broadcoms ability to conduct
its operations in the ordinary course of business prior to Closing.

(b) Avago shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in connection
with Broadcoms request for the IRS Ruling and shall promptly provide all
necessary information and assistance in connection with the IRS Ruling
request.

 

(c) Neither Avago nor Broadcom shall knowingly take or fail to take (and,
following the Transactions, Holdco will cause Avago and Broadcom not to
knowingly take or fail to take) any action which action (or failure to act)
would reasonably be expected to (i) cause the Cash/Stock Merger and the Avago
Scheme, taken together, to fail to qualify as an "exchange" within
the meaning of Section 351(a) of the Code, (ii) cause the Avago Scheme to
fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code or (iii) constitute a "triggering event" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(j)(1) or (2). With respect to the
Transactions, Holdco will (and following the Transactions will cause the
Broadcom Surviving Corporation and the other Avago Parties, as applicable, to)
file all required information with its Tax Returns and maintain all records
required for Tax purposes, including the reporting requirements contained in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

 



104 (d) Holdco will make commercially reasonable arrangements with each five-
percent transferee shareholder (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) and each "5-percent shareholder" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii)), if any, to ensure that such
shareholder will be informed of any "triggering event" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(j)(1) or (2).

(e) Holdco, Broadcom and Avago shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Transactions that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the
Effective Times. Each of the Avago Parties shall (and Avago shall cause each
of the other Avago Parties) pay, without deduction from any amount payable to
holders of Broadcom Common Share or Avago Ordinary Shares and without
reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by
any Governmental Entity (or for which its shareholders are primarily liable),
which becomes payable in connection with the Transactions.

 

(f) At the Effective Time and through the consummation of the Transactions,
Intermediate Holdco, Finance Holdco and Lower Holdco will be disregarded as
separate from Holdco and, following the Unit Merger (if relevant), New LP, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. New LP will be disregarded as separate from
Holdco until the Unit Merger (if relevant) and, absent the Unit Merger,
will remain an entity disregarded as separate from Holdco, in each case, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Avago Parties will file any required
elections pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 to assure such
classifications. The Avago Parties have no plan or intention to change or
cause Intermediate Holdco, Finance Holdco or Lower Holdco to change their
classification such that either entity may become classified as other than a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, Broadcom shall deliver to the Avago Parties a
duly executed certificate, dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, certifying that (A) Broadcom is not and in the preceding five-
year period has never been a "United States real property holding corporation"
as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and (B) none of the Equity Interests in Broadcom
constitutes a "United States real property interest" as defined in Section
897(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, which
certificate shall be in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Avago Parties.

 

Section 6.20 _Shareholder Litigation_. Broadcom shall (a) promptly (and in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) inform Avago orally and in writing of
any shareholder litigation or other Proceedings brought or threatened in
writing against Broadcom or any of its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and keep Avago fully informed on
a current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by promptly
furnishing to Avago and its Representatives such information relating to such
shareholder litigation as such Persons may reasonably request), (b) give
Avago the opportunity and right to participate in the defense of any such
shareholder litigation at Avagos sole cost and expense, including in any and
all Proceedings related to any such shareholder litigation and any proposed

 



105  settlement or disposition thereof, and (c) not cease to defend, consent to
the entry of any judgment, offer to settle, enter into any settlement or take
any other material action with respect to any such shareholder litigation or
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Avago, which such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 6.21 _Marketable Securities_. Prior to the Closing, Broadcom shall,
upon written request of Avago, provide Avago with a list of all marketable
securities held by Broadcom or any of its Subsidiaries and the jurisdiction in
which such securities are held, as promptly as is reasonably practicable
following the date of any such request.

fraud or Knowing and Intentional Material Breach of this Agreement. All
payments contemplated by this _Section 8.2(c)_ shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Avago and shall be
reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

 

(d) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Avago pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ (Avago Superior Proposal) or by
Broadcom pursuant to  _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ (Avago Change of
Recommendation);

 



114 (ii) by Broadcom pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Termination Date) (but
only if at such time (A) Broadcom would not be prohibited from terminating
this Agreement by the first proviso in _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ without a vote of
Avagos shareholders being taken; (B) there has been publicly disclosed for
the first time after the date of this Agreement prior to the termination of
this Agreement an Avago Acquisition Proposal; and (C) within twelve (12)
months after such termination, either (1) Avago enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Avago Qualifying Transaction pursuant to an Avago
Acquisition Proposal, which Avago Qualifying Transaction is later consummated
with the Person that made such Avago Acquisition Proposal (regardless of
whether such consummation occurs within the twelve (12)-month period), or (2)
an Avago Qualifying Transaction occurs); or

 

(iii) by either Avago of Broadcom pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (Failure
to Obtain Avago Shareholder Approval at Avago Shareholder Meeting), there has
been publicly disclosed for the first time after the date of this Agreement
and not withdrawn prior to the time of the Avago Shareholder Meeting, an Avago
Acquisition Proposal and within twelve (12) months after such termination,
either (1) Avago enters into a definitive written agreement with respect to an
Avago Qualifying Transaction pursuant to an Avago Acquisition Proposal, which
Broadcom Qualifying Transaction is later consummated with the Person that
made such Broadcom Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether such
consummation occurs with such twelve (12)-month period), or (2) an Avago
Qualifying Transaction occurs;

 

then Avago shall pay Broadcom the Avago Termination Fee in cash:

 

(A) concurrently with any termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ (Avago
Superior Proposal);

 

(B) within two (2) Business Days following any termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ (Avago Change of Recommendation); and

(C) within five (5) Business Days after the consummation of an Avago

circumstances set forth in _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_;
_provided_ , that the Avago No-Vote Fee shall be credited against the Avago
Termination Fee if the Avago No-Vote Fee has previously been paid to
Broadcom;

it being understood that in no event shall Avago be required to pay the fee
referred to in this  _Section 8.2(d)_ on more than one occasion. Upon
payment of such fee, each of the Avago Parties shall have no further liability
to Broadcom with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall release any party from
liability for fraud or Knowing and Intentional Material Breach of this
Agreement. All payments contemplated by this _Section 8.2(d)_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Broadcom and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes.

 



115 (e) Each of the Avago Parties and Broadcom acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
the Avago Parties and Broadcom would not enter into this Agreement and (iii)
any amount payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Avago Parties and Broadcom in the circumstances in which such amount is
payable.

 

(f) Any amounts payable by Broadcom pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall be in
addition to any amounts payable by Broadcom pursuant to  _Section 9.13_. Any
amounts payable by Avago pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_
shall be in addition to any amounts payable by Avago pursuant to _Section
9.13_ and any of Avagos expense reimbursement and indemnification
obligations contained in _Section 6.16_. If Broadcom or Avago, as applicable,
fails to pay when due any amount payable under this _Section 8.2_, then (i)
such party shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable, documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the
enforcement by the other party of its rights under this  _Section 8.2_ and
(ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount
(for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually
paid to the other party in full) at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became past due in The
Wall Street Journal "Money Rates" column, plus 350 basis points.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Broadcom, on behalf of
itself and each of its shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and other Representatives
(each, a " _Broadcom Related Party_ ") agrees that neither any Financing
Source under the Debt Commitment Letters nor any of their respective
Affiliates, Representatives, successors or assigns shall have any liability or
obligation to any Broadcom Related Party in connection with the financing of
any portion of the Debt Financing, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

in accordance with this _Section 9.3_; _provided_ , that any notice received

Day after 5:00 P.M. (addressees local time) shall be deemed to have been

_provided_ , _further_ , that notice of any change to the address or any of

9.3_ shall be deemed to constitute consent to the manner or address for
service of process in connection with any legal proceeding, including
litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. Each representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement and condition contained in this Agreement shall have independent
significance. Information provided in any section of the Broadcom Disclosure
Schedule or the Avago Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an adequate
response and disclosure of such facts or circumstances with respect to any
section of _Article IV_ (in the case of the Broadcom Disclosure Schedule) or
_Article V_ (in the case of the Avago Disclosure Schedule) calling for
disclosure of such information, whether or not such disclosure is specifically
associated with or purports to respond to one or more or all of such
representations or warranties, but only if the relevance of that reference as
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be reasonably apparent to an individual who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties. The inclusion of any item
in the Broadcom Disclosure Schedule or the Avago Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor
shall it establish any standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



118 Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Broadcom Disclosure Schedule, Avago Disclosure Schedule and
the exhibits and instruments referred to herein), the California Merger
Agreement(s), the Confidentiality Agreement and any Joinder executed by an
Avago Party following the date hereof (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) except for
(i) the rights of Broadcoms shareholders to receive the Broadcom Merger
Consideration following the Broadcom Effective Times in accordance with
_Article III_ , (ii) the right of Broadcom, on behalf of its shareholders, to

Intentional Material Breach of this Agreement, which right is hereby

on loss of the economic and bargain benefits of the Transactions
to Broadcoms shareholders based on the consideration that would have
otherwise been payable to holders of Broadcom Common Shares, the loss of
market value or decline in share price of such Broadcom Common Shares or

combination or other opportunities and the time value of money) and (iii) as
provided in _Section 6.7_ (which is intended for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties and the DandO Indemnitees) are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on, _Sections 8.2(g)_ , _9.1_ , _9.8_ , _9.9_ , _9.10_ ,
_9.18_ and this _Section 9.6_ and (y) neither Broadcom nor any of its
Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any rights
or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.6_ shall in any way
limit or modify the rights and obligations of Avago under this Agreement or
any Financing Sources obligations to Avago under the Debt Commitment Letter.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all litigation, claims,

indirectly, arising out of or in connection with or relating to any matter
which is the subject of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the actions of the Avago Parties in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof or thereof, shall be

relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof.

 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching parties, for
which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each party hereby consents to the granting of injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof and to compel performance of such partys obligations, this being in

entitled at law or in equity.

obligation. Any covenant, agreement or obligation of any Avago Party
hereunder shall be deemed to be and shall constitute a covenant, agreement and
obligation of and by Avago to cause any such Avago Party to perform and
discharge such covenant, agreement or obligation. Avago and Holdco shall be
jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of them or the other

to any amendments, waivers, extensions or renewals affecting this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any Avago Party or
the Nominee fails in any manner whatsoever to pay, perform or observe any of
the Obligations, Avago will itself duly and promptly pay, perform or observe,
as the case may be, such Obligations, or cause the same to be duly and
promptly paid, performed or observed, in each case as if Avago were itself
any such Avago Party or the Nominee with respect to such Obligations.

pursuing or exhausting any right or remedy that Broadcom or any of its
successors or assigns may have against any other such Avago Party, any of its
successors or assigns (or any Affiliates thereof) or any other Person.

Section 9.16  _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for

interpretative effect whatsoever.

failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

Section 9.18 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
EACH OF THE AVAGO PARTIES AND BROADCOM HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT

4.1 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify each Shareholder
and each of such Shareholders trustees and beneficiaries and their
respective directors, officers, managers, employees, consultants, controlling
persons, advisors and successors and assigns of each of the foregoing in their
capacity of such relationship to such Shareholder (collectively, "
_Indemnitees_ " with respect to such Shareholder) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable law against any and all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, witness, expert and consultant
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually incurred by
any Indemnitee in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Company)
to which such Indemnitee is, was, or at any time becomes a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, to the extent arising from the related
Shareholders entry into, or performance under, this Agreement and that
otherwise involves or relates directly or indirectly to any facts,
circumstances, events or other matters arising out of, or related to, the
Merger Agreement or this Agreement.

 

(b) Not later than twenty (20) days after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice
of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding described in _Section
4.1(a)_, such Indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the
commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Company will
not relieve it from any liability hereunder unless such omission materially
prejudices the Company, or from any liability which it may have to any
Indemnitee other than under this Agreement.

 

(c) With respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which an
Indemnitee notifies the Company of the commencement or threat thereof, such
Indemnitee shall have the right to choose counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Company (it being understood that Morrison and Foerster LLP and McDermott Will and
Emery LLP are deemed acceptable) to defend any such pending or threatened
action, suit or proceeding, and such Indemnitee shall be entitled to conduct
the defense of such action, suit or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all Indemnitees affiliated or associated with the Shareholder Group shall use
a single such counsel (together with any required local counsel). Such
Indemnitee will consider in good faith joint representation with other
defendants in such action, suit or proceeding but shall not be obligated to
agree to such joint representation or accept any other representation
recommended by the Company. Such Indemnitee shall not be permitted to settle
any such action, suit or proceeding without the written consent of the
Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company
will be entitled to participate in any such action, suit or proceeding at its
own expense.

(d) Solely in the event of the written request of such Indemnitee, the
Company may at its election assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee and following notice from the
Company to such Indemnitee of the Companys assumption of the defense
thereof, the Company will not be liable to such Indemnitee under this
Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs
of investigation or as otherwise provided below (but shall remain liable for
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection therewith to the
extent that indemnification therefor was otherwise required under this
Agreement). In such event, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
counsel in such

 



A - 7  action, suit or proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel
incurred after notice from the Company of the Companys assumption of the
defense thereof shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee unless (i) the
employment of counsel by such Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company in
writing, (ii) such Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may
be a conflict of interest between the Company and such Indemnitee in the
conduct of the defense of such action, suit or proceeding (in which event
_Section 4.1(c)_ shall apply) or (iii) the Company shall not in fact have
employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding in
each of which cases the fees and expenses of Indemnitees separate counsel
shall be at the expense of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Indemnitees affiliated or associated with the Shareholder Group shall use a
single such counsel (together with any required local counsel).

(e) The Company shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee pursuant
hereto (i) in connection with any action, suit or proceeding that is initiated
by such Indemnitee against the Company, Holdco or Antelope (unless such
action, suit or proceeding was authorized in the specific case by action of
the Board of Directors of the subject company, or is to enforce or obtain a
declaration of such Indemnitees rights under the terms of any provision of
this Agreement), or (ii) if it shall be determined by a final adjudication of
a court of competent jurisdiction (from which there is no right of appeal)
that such indemnification is not lawful (in which case the Company shall
remain obligated for the contribution obligations under clause (j) below).

 

(f) The Company shall not be liable to indemnify an Indemnitee under this
Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected
without the Companys written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Company shall be permitted to settle any action for
which the Indemnitee is fully indemnified by the Company or a third party
except that (i) the Company shall not settle any action or claim in any
manner which would impose any expense, payment, penalty or limitation on
Shareholder without Shareholders written consent and (ii) the Company shall
not settle any action, claim or proceeding without obtaining a full and
complete release of such Indemnitee with respect thereto. Neither the Company
nor any Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any
proposed settlement.

 

(g) In the event that an Indemnitee employs the Indemnitees own counsel at
the expense of the Company pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section
4.1_, the Company shall, to the fullest extent possible and except as
prohibited by law, advance to such Indemnitee, prior to any final disposition
of any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, any and all reasonable expenses
(including legal, expert and consultant fees and expenses) incurred in
investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding within thirty
(30) calendar days after delivery to the Company of copies of invoices for
such expenses.

(h) In the event an Indemnitee is required to bring any action, suit
or proceeding to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this Agreement
and is successful in such action, the Company shall reimburse such Indemnitee
for all of such Indemnitees reasonable legal fees and other expenses in
bringing and pursuing such action.

 



A - 8 (i) The obligations of the Company contained herein shall continue during the
period the Agreement is in effect, and shall continue thereafter so long as
any Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal or
investigative, that is subject to indemnification hereunder.

(j) If the indemnification provided hereby is unavailable with respect to any
Shareholder by reason of a court decision, the Company shall contribute to
the amount of expenses (including attorneys fees, witness, expert and
consultant fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
incurred and paid or payable by an Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law.

(k) From and after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Holdco and Antelope shall cause the Company to honor its
obligations hereunder and Holdco and Antelope will be jointly and severally
responsible, together with the Company, for such obligations.

 

4.2 _Expenses of Shareholders_. In addition to and without limiting the rights
of each Shareholder and other Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 4.1_, and
whether or not the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
consummated, the Company will promptly pay or reimburse, upon submission, the
Shareholder Groups out-of-pocket expenses pertaining to the Merger Agreement
and this Agreement or any of the transactions or other matters contemplated by
any of such agreements, in an amount not to exceed $1,200,000 for the
Shareholder Group in the aggregate. No Shareholder will be deemed to have
waived any attorney-client or other privilege by reason of submitting for
payment or reimbursement any statements or invoices from its legal advisors.

Date by more than 60 days, (e) the addition of any new material additional
condition to the consummation of the Merger in favor of Antelope and (f) the

nothing set forth in this _Section 5.2_ shall relieve any party hereto from
liability for any Knowing and Intentional Breach of this Agreement prior to
termination hereof, and (y) the provisions of _Section 1.6_ and this _Article
V_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Knowing and Intentional Material Breach_ " shall (y)
with respect to the Corporate Parties, have the meaning set forth in the
Merger Agreement, and (z) with respect to a Shareholder, shall mean a material
breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or omission to act
undertaken by such Shareholder with the actual knowledge that the taking of
such act, or such failure to act, would cause a material breach of this
Agreement. Each Shareholder that is a natural person acknowledges that such

or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case

thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Prior to the Buffalo Effective Times,

the form of the Partnership Agreement which adversely affects in any material
respect the rights of the holders of Units thereunder without the prior

hereof.

 

5.4 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto

otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other parties hereto, except that Antelope and
Holdco may transfer or assign their respective rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one of more of their

rules of conflict of laws. Each of Holdco, Antelope, the Company and the

City of San Jose and County of Santa Clara, California, or if no such state
court has proper jurisdiction, then the Federal court of the U.S. located in

and maintain an agent in the State of California as such partys agent for
acceptance of legal process and (b) that service of process may also be made
on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt

California. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE

agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, among the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter.

deemed unenforceable if it is subject to an interpretation that would render
it enforceable. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any provision
of this Agreement is unenforceable, in whole or in part, (a) such a finding
will not disturb the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions
of this Agreement, and (b) the court shall have the authority to modify and/or
"blue pencil" this Agreement in order to render it enforceable and to effect
the original intent of the parties to the fullest extent permitted by law

event and (b) the Shareholders would be irreparably damaged if for any reason
any Corporate Party fails to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement and the Shareholders may not have an adequate remedy at law for
money damages in such event. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto shall be

Interests (for the avoidance of doubt, not taking into account Section
3.4(d), Section 5.4(a), Section 5.4(b), Section 5.4(f) or any other provision
of this Agreement the effect of which is to cause the economic rights of the
holders of the Exchangeable Units and the economic rights of the General
Partner as holder of the Common Units to not be proportionate to their
respective Percentage Interests). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Without limiting the generality of Section 3.4(a):

Interests of the Partners in accordance with the definition of "Percentage
Interests", the General Partner shall contribute the proceeds of such
issuance (net of any selling or underwriting discounts or commissions or
other expenses, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be
reimbursed by the Partnership in accordance with Section 5.4(f) and such
reimbursement proceeds shall be deemed to be contributed by the General
Partner to the Partnership) to the Partnership as a capital contribution on
account of its Common Units; and 
---|---|---

if a new class of shares in the capital of Holdings is created and issued by
Holdings ("New Shares"), the General Partner shall (either immediately before
or after such issuance) (A) cause the Partnership to create a corresponding
new class of Partnership Interests ("New Interests") that has corresponding
distribution rights to such New Shares, (B) cause the Partnership to issue
one or more New Interests in exchange for the contribution by Holdings of the
proceeds from the issuance of such New Shares (net of any selling or
underwriting discounts or commissions or other expenses, which for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to be reimbursed by the Partnership in
accordance with Section 5.4(f) and such reimbursement proceeds shall be deemed
to be contributed by the General Partner to the Partnership) to the
Partnership, and (C) effect such amendments to this Agreement as are
necessary in order to provide that the distributions and allocations on the
New Interests to Holdings pursuant 

---|---|--- 
 



D-16  fund distributions on such New Shares in accordance with their terms and such
other amendments as are necessary such that the capital of Holdings in the
Partnership continues to correspond with the outstanding capital of Holdings. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Other than in connection with any Direct Exchange, upon the
exchange of any Exchangeable Units for Exchanged Shares pursuant to the
exercise of an Exchange Right, as of the effective date of such exchange,
each Exchanged Share issued in exchange for an Exchangeable Unit shall be
deemed (i) to have been first contributed by Holdings to the Partnership as a
capital contribution in respect of its Common Units and (ii) then immediately
thereafter to have been delivered by the Partnership to the holder exercising
the Exchange Right and the Exchangeable Unit shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist. Upon the exchange of any Exchangeable Units for the Cash
Amount (as defined in Schedule A) pursuant to the exercise of an Exchange
Right, as of the effective date of such exchange, each such Exchangeable Unit
automatically shall be deemed cancelled concurrently with such payment,
without any action on the part of any Person, including Holdings or the
Partnership. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If Holdings proposes to redeem, repurchase or otherwise
acquire any Holdings Shares for cash, the Partnership shall, immediately prior

, that for greater certainty, the above restrictions shall not apply (A) to
dividends or distributions on Holdings Shares where an equal distribution is

faith, with the assistance of a reputable and qualified independent financial
advisor selected by the General Partner and such other experts as the General
Partner may require, equitable and economic equivalence for the purposes of

such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to cause such Holdings
Shares (or such other shares or securities) to be and remain duly registered,
qualified or approved under United States law. Holdings will use its

extent that such Partner is not a natural person, the ultimate beneficial
owner of the Units held by such Partner) or any member of such Partners (or
such beneficial owners) immediate family, by will or otherwise upon the
death of such Partner or otherwise for estate planning purposes, by operation
of law, to any other Partner, or for charitable purposes or as charitable
gifts or donations, and (iii) to any Person who is a Permitted Transferee

agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.

change, Transfer, substitution or addition is duly reflected in an amendment

Limited Partners as reflected from time to time in the Record, as from time to
time amended, will be conclusive as to those facts for all purposes of the
Partnership. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Where the transferee complies with all applicable provisions
and is entitled to become a Limited Partner pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, the General Partner shall admit the transferee to the Partnership
as a substituted Limited Partner and the Limited Partners hereby consent to
the admission of, and will admit, the transferee to the Partnership as a

discretion, no Person will be recognized (including in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code) by the Partnership or
any Limited Partner as holding any Unit on behalf of another Person with the
beneficial interest in that other Person, and the Partnership and Limited
Partners will not be bound or compelled in any way to recognize (even when
having actual notice) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest
in any Unit or in any fractional part of a Unit or any other rights in respect
of any Unit except an absolute right to the entirety of the Unit in the
Limited Partner shown on the Record as holder of that Unit.



   3.20 | _Incapacity, Death, Insolvency or Bankruptcy_ 
---|--- 

Where a Person becomes entitled to Units on the incapacity, death, insolvency,
or bankruptcy of a Limited Partner, or otherwise by operation of Law, in
addition to the requirements of Section 3.15, that entitlement will not be

Transfer Agent of that Persons entitlement; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | has delivered any other evidence, approvals and consents in

D-23  ---|--- 



     | (a) | Units shall not be certificated unless otherwise determined
by the General Partner in its sole discretion. If the Partnership determines
that one or more Units shall be certificated, each such certificate shall be
signed by or in the name of the Partnership, by the Chief Executive Officer
and any other officer designated by the General Partner, representing the
number of Units held by such holder. Such certificate shall be in such form
as the General Partner may determine and shall contain such legends as
required by Law or as deemed appropriate by the General Partner to alert third
parties to the terms, conditions and restrictions contained in
this Agreement. Any or all of such signatures on any certificate representing
one or more Units may be a facsimile, engraved or printed, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If Units are certificated, the General Partner may direct
that a new certificate representing one or more Units be issued in place of
any certificate theretofore issued by the Partnership alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon delivery to the General Partner of an
affidavit of the owner or owners of such certificate, setting forth such
allegation. The General Partner may require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give the
Partnership a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be
made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
any such certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Upon surrender to the Partnership or the Registrar and
Transfer Agent of a certificate for one or more Units, duly endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
Transfer, in compliance with the provisions hereof, the Partnership shall
issue a new certificate representing one or more Units to the Person entitled
thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its
books. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the General Partner may
prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate
relating to the issue, Transfer and registration of Units.

   3.23 | _Record Holders_ 
---|--- 

In accordance with Section 3.15, the Partnership shall be entitled to
recognize the Record Holder as the Limited Partner with respect to any Units
and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim
to or interest in such Units on the part of any other Person, whether or not
the Partnership shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
provided by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person
(such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an
agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other
representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding Units,
as between the Partnership on the one hand and such other Person on the other
hand, such representative Person shall be the Record Holder of such Units. A
Person may become a Record Holder without the consent or approval of any
Partner.

 



D-24  ---|--- 
 

For so long as Exchangeable Units remain outstanding (not including
Exchangeable Units held by Holdings and its Subsidiaries):

 



     | (a) | no tender offer, share exchange offer, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction with
respect to Holdings Shares (a "Holdings Offer") will be proposed or
recommended by Holdings or the Holdings Board of Directors or otherwise
effected with the consent or approval of the Holdings Board of Directors
unless the holders of Exchangeable Units (other than Holdings and its
Subsidiaries) are entitled to participate in such Holdings Offer to the same
extent and on an equitably and economically equivalent basis as the holders of
Holdings Shares, without discrimination. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, except in order to permit the Holdings Board of Directors to
fulfill its fiduciary duties under applicable law, neither Holdings nor the
Holdings Board of Directors will approve or recommend any Holdings Offer or
take any action in furtherance of a Holdings Offer unless, and Holdings will
act in good faith to put in place procedures or to cause the Transfer Agent to
put in place procedures to ensure that, the holders of Exchangeable Units may
participate in such Holdings Offer and any exchange required thereby shall be
conditional upon and shall only be effective if the Holdings Shares tendered
or deposited under such Holdings Offer are taken up); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | no tender offer, share exchange offer, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction with
respect to Exchangeable Units (a "Units Offer") will be proposed or
recommended by Holdings or the Holdings Board of Directors or otherwise
effected with the consent or approval of the Holdings Board of Directors
unless the holders of Holdings Shares (other than Holdings and its
Subsidiaries) are entitled to participate in such Units Offer to the same
extent and on an equitably and economically equivalent basis as the holders of

D-25  ---|--- 



   4.3 | _Maintenance of Capital Accounts_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | There shall be established for each Partner on the books of
the Partnership as of the date such Partner becomes a Partner a capital
account (each being a "Capital Account"). Each Capital Contribution by any
Partner, if any, shall be credited to the Capital Account of such Partner on
the date such Capital Contribution is made to the Partnership. In addition,
each Partners Capital Account shall be (a) credited with (i) such Partners
allocable share of any Net Income of the Partnership and any items in the
nature of income or gain that are specially allocated to such Partner pursuant
to Section 5.2(b), and (ii) the amount of any Partnership liabilities that
are assumed by the Partner or secured by any Partnership property distributed
to the Partner, (b) debited with (i) the amount of distributions (and
deemed distributions) to such Partner of cash or the Carrying Value of other
property so distributed, (ii) such Partners allocable share of Net Loss of
the Partnership and any items in the nature of deduction or loss that are
specially allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.2(b), and (iii) the
amount of any liabilities of the Partner assumed by the Partnership or which
are secured by any property contributed by the Partner to the Partnership and
(c) otherwise maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Code and
the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Any other item which is
required to be reflected in a Partners Capital Account under Section 704(b)
of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or
otherwise under this Agreement shall be so reflected. The General Partner
shall make such adjustments to Capital Accounts as it determines in its sole
discretion to be appropriate to ensure allocations are made in accordance
with a Partners interest in the Partnership. Interest shall not be payable on
Capital Account balances. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the General Partner shall maintain the Capital Accounts of
the Partners in accordance with the principles and requirements set forth in

immediately prior to the contribution of more than a de minimis amount of
money or other property to the Partnership by a new or existing Partner as
consideration for one or more Units; (ii) the distribution by the Partnership
to a Partner of more than a de minimis amount of property in respect of one or
more Units; (iii) the issuance by the Partnership of more than a de minimis
amount of Units as consideration for the provision of services to or for the
benefit of the Partnership (as described in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section

within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g);
_provided_ , however, that adjustments pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above shall be made only if the General Partner reasonably determines that
such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative
economic interests of the Partners.

D-26  contrary in this Agreement, in the event the General Partner shall determine,
in its sole discretion, that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the
Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to
give economic effect to the manner in which distributions are made to the
Partners pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5.4 and 13.3, the General
Partner may make such modification.

 _PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND LOSSES_



   5.1 | _[RESERVED]_ 
---|--- 



   5.2 | _Allocation for Capital Account Purposes_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 5.2(b), Net Income (Net Loss) of the Partnership for each Fiscal Year
or other taxable period shall be allocated among the Capital Accounts of the
Partners in a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the
manner in which distributions are made to the Partners pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 5.4(a)(ii).  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 5.2, the following special allocations shall be made for each
Fiscal Year or other taxable period: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 5.2, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if
necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in U.S.
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and
1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For purposes of this Section
5.2(b)(i), each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be
determined, and the allocation of income and gain required hereunder shall
be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to
this Section 5.2(b) with respect to such taxable period (other than an
allocation pursuant to Sections 5.2(b)(iii) and (iv)). This Section 5.2(b)(i)
is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback
requirement in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



D-27  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5.2 (other than Section
5.2(b)(i)), except as provided in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period
shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and,
if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in U.S.
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any
successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 5.2(b)(ii), each Partners
Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of
income and gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the
application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), other
than Section 5.2(b)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Sections
5.2(b)(v) and (vi), with respect to such taxable period. This Section
5.2(b)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and
gain requirement in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) (4) and shall
be interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner
unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described
in U.S. Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6),
items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such
Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent
required by the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of
the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created
by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible
unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to Sections
5.2(b)(i) or (ii). This Section 5.2(b)(iii) is intended to qualify and be
construed as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a
deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable
period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to
restore pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such
Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such
excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to
this Section 5.2(b)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after
all other allocations provided for in this Section 5.2 have been tentatively
made as if this Section 5.2(b)(iv) were not in this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
 



D-28  any taxable period shall be allocated to the holders of the Common Units and
the Exchangeable Units in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests. If the General Partner determines that the Partnerships
Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the
safe harbor requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized to revise the
prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such
requirements. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that
bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt
to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance
with U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner
bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt,
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated
between or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they
share such Economic Risk of Loss. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vii) | _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership described in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall
be allocated among the Partners in a manner chosen by the General Partner and
consistent with such Treasury Regulation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to
Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such
item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be
adjusted pursuant to such Section of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | _Curative Allocation_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) |

The Required Allocations are intended to comply with certain requirements of
the U.S. Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the Partners that, to the
extent possible, all Required Allocations shall be offset either with other
Required Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Partnership
income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Section 5.2(b)(ix).
Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 5 (other than
the Required Allocations), the General Partner shall make such offsetting
special allocations of Partnership income, gain, loss or

D-29  (taking into account required future allocations) so that, after such
offsetting allocations are made, each Partners Capital Account balance is,
to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Partner
would have had if the Required Allocations were not part of this Agreement and
all Partnership items were allocated pursuant to the economic agreement among
the Partners. 
---|--- 



     | (B) | The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable
period, (1) apply the provisions of Section 5.2(b)(ix)(A) in whatever order is
most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result
from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to
Section 5.2(b)(ix)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to
minimize such economic distortions.  
---|---|--- 



   5.3 | _Allocation of Net Income and Losses for Tax Purposes_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Except as otherwise provided herein, each item of income,
gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of
"book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section
5.2(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the U.S.
Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with
respect to any Property contributed to the capital of the Partnership and
with respect to reverse Code Section 704(c) allocations described in U.S.
Treasury Regulations 1.704-3(a)(6) shall, solely for tax purposes, be
allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any variation between
the adjusted basis of such Property to the Partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and its initial Carrying Value or its Carrying Value determined
pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) (computed
in accordance with the definition of Carrying Value) using any allocation
method under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3 as the General Partner
may decide. Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations
shall be made by the General Partner in any manner that reasonably reflects
the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.3, Section 704(c) of the Code (and the principles thereof), and
U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(i) are solely for purposes of
federal, state, and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken
into account in computing, any Partners Capital Account or share of Net
Income, Net Loss, other items, or distributions pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The General Partner shall determine all matters concerning allocations for tax
purposes not expressly provided for herein in its sole discretion. For the
proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of
uniformity of Units (or any portion or class or classes thereof), the General
Partner may (i) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to
reflect the proposal or 

---|---|--- 
 



D-30  704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve
uniformity of Units (or any portion or class or classes thereof), and (ii)
adopt and employ or modify such conventions and methods as the General Partner
determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate for (A) the determination
for U.S. federal income tax purposes of items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit and the allocation of such items among Partners and
between transferors and transferees under this Agreement and pursuant to the
Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, (B)
the determination of the identities and tax classification of Partners, (C)
the valuation of Partnership assets and the determination of tax basis, (D)
the allocation of asset values and tax basis, and (E) the adoption and
maintenance of accounting methods. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | For purposes of determining the items of Partnership income,
gain, loss, deduction, or credit allocable to any Partner for U.S. federal
income tax purposes with respect to any period, such items shall be
determined on a daily, monthly, quarterly or other basis, as determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion, using any permissible method under
Section 706 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Partner under
the provisions of this Article 5 shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee
has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with
Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by the General
Partner in its sole discretion.  
---|---|--- 



   5.4 | _Distributions_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Subject to Sections 5.4(c) and 5.4(f), if a dividend or
distribution shall have been declared and be payable in respect of a Holdings
Share (excluding where a dividend or distribution is effected in accordance
with Section 3.5), the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | make a distribution in respect of each Exchangeable Unit in
an amount equal to the dividend or distribution payable in respect of a
Holdings Share; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | make a distribution in respect of the outstanding Common
Units in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the dividends or
distributions payable in respect of the Holdings Shares; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is
authorized to take any action that may be required to cause the Partnership
or any of its Affiliates to comply with any withholding requirements
established under the Code (including pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446 and 3406), or any other federal, state, local or foreign law. To the
extent that the Partnership is required to or elects to withhold and pay over
to any taxing authority any amount 

---|---|--- 
 



D-31  any Partner (including by reason of Section 1446 of the Code) or to the extent
that any payments made to the Partnership are subject to withholding as a
result of such payments being attributable to any particular Partner, the
General Partner may treat the amount withheld as a distribution of cash to
such Partner pursuant to Sections 5.4 and 13.3 in the amount of
such withholding from or in respect of such Partner. The General Partner may
treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts previously
withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as a
distribution of cash to such Partners. In any such case, unless such amount
was withheld from amounts otherwise distributable to such Partner hereunder,
it shall be treated as an advance to such Partner which shall be repayable on
demand and if not repaid may be set off against subsequent distributions to
such Partner. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), in the event of the
dissolution of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Fiscal Year quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and
distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, Section 13.3. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall
be paid by the Partnership, directly or through the Registrar and Transfer
Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such
Partnership Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such
payment shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships
liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person
who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an assignment or
otherwise. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Partnership, and the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership, shall not be required to make a distribution to a Partner or a
Record Holder if such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable
Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4(a), the General Partner, in its
sole discretion, may authorize that to the extent that the General Partner
determines in good faith that expenses or other obligations of Holdings are
related to its role as the General Partner or the business and affairs of
Holdings that are conducted through the Partnership or any of the
Partnerships direct or indirect Subsidiaries, cash (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, only cash) distributions may be made to Holdings (which
distributions shall be made without pro rata distributions to the other
Partners) in amounts required for Holdings to pay: (i) any tax liabilities of
Holdings, (ii) any operating, administrative and other similar costs incurred
by Holdings (including (w) payments in respect of indebtedness and equity
securities of Holdings to the extent the proceeds are used or will be used by
Holdings to pay expenses or other obligations described in this Section 5.4(f)
(in either case only to the extent economically equivalent indebtedness or
equity securities of the Partnership were not issued to Holdings), (x)
indemnification obligations of Holdings owing to directors, officers,
employees or other persons under Holdings articles, charter, by-laws or other
governing documents or pursuant to written  

---|---|--- 
 



D-32  in respect of director and officer insurance (including premiums therefor) and
(z) payments pursuant to any legal, tax, accounting and other professional
fees and expenses); (iii) any judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or
other costs and expenses in respect of any claims against, or any litigation
or proceedings involving, Holdings; (iv) fees and expenses (including any
underwriters discounts and commissions) related to any securities offering,
investment or acquisition transaction (whether or not successful) authorized
by the board of directors of Holdings, including any fees and
expenses incurred in connection the registration, qualification or listing of
any Holdings Shares (or other shares or securities into which Holdings Shares
may be reclassified or changed as contemplated by Section 3.4) as contemplated
by Section 3.10; and (v) other fees and expenses in connection with the
maintenance of the existence of Holdings (including any costs or expenses
associated with being a public company listed on any national securities
exchange and compliance with applicable Laws or the requirements of a
Governmental Authority). For the avoidance of doubt, distributions made under
this Section 5.4(f) may not be used to pay or facilitate dividends or
distributions on the Holdings Shares and must be used solely for one of the
express purposes set forth pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. All
distributions under this Section 5.4(f) shall be treated as "guaranteed
payments" within the meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code. 
---|--- 



   5.5 | _Repayments_ 
---|--- 

If, as determined in good faith by the General Partner, it appears that any
Partner has received an amount under this Article 5 which is in excess of that
Partners entitlement, the Partner will, promptly upon notice from the General
Partner, reimburse the Partnership to the extent of the excess, and failing
immediate reimbursement, the General Partner may withhold the amount of the
excess (with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) from time to time
calculated and compounded monthly) from further distributions otherwise due
to the Partner.

 _WITHDRAWAL OF CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS_



   6.1 | _Withdrawal_

except as permitted by Law.

agreement with any of its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or

---|---|--- 
 



D-37  fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of
the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions

exchange for Partnership Interests or options, rights, warrants
or appreciation rights relating to Partnership Interests, the General
Partner, in determining whether the appropriate Partnership Interest or

fair market value of the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities
assumed, the tax basis in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations

exercise in comparable circumstances. Further, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be amended, and
no action may be taken by the General Partner, without the consent of each
Limited Partner, if any, adversely affected thereby in any material respect,
if such amendment or action would (i) convert a Limited Partner into a general
partner of the Partnership (except as a result of the Limited
Partner becoming the General Partner in accordance with the provisions
hereof), (ii) modify the limited liability of a Limited Partner, or (ii) amend
this Section 7.5.

General Partner nor its officers, directors, shareholders, employees or agents
are or will be liable, responsible for or accountable in damages or otherwise
to the Partnership or a Limited Partner for an action taken or failure to act
on behalf of the Partnership unless the General Partners act or omission (a)
was outside the scope of the authority conferred on the General Partner by
this Agreement or by Law, (b) was in breach of, or was performed or
omitted fraudulently or in bad faith or constituted gross negligence, willful
or reckless disregard of the General Partners obligations under, this
Agreement or (c) was in breach of the General Partners fiduciary duty
under Section 7.18(c).

 



D-38  ---|--- 



     | (a) | To the fullest extent permitted by Law but subject to the
limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, the General Partner, the Tax
Matters Partner, a Departing Partner, any Person who is or was an Affiliate
of the General Partner or any Departing Partner, any Person who is or was an
officer, director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner
or any Departing Partner or any Affiliate, or any Person who is or was
serving at the request of the General Partner or any Departing Partner or any
Affiliate as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another Person
(collectively, an "Indemnitee"), will be indemnified and held harmless by the
Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
joint or several expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and
expenses on a solicitor/client basis), judgments, fines, settlements and
other amounts (collectively, "Damages") arising from any and all claims,
demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved,
or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its
status as: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the General Partner, the Tax Matters Partner, a Departing
Partner, any Person who is or was an Affiliate of the General Partner or any
Departing Partner;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any Person who is or was an officer, director, employee,
partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any Departing Partner or
any Affiliate; or  
---|---|---

General Partner or any Departing Partner or any Affiliate as a director,
officer, employee, agent or trustee of another Person,

of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee that (a) was outside the scope
of the authority conferred on the General Partner by this Agreement or by Law,
(b) was in breach of, or was performed or omitted fraudulently or in bad faith
or constituted gross negligence or willful or reckless disregard of the
General Partners obligations under, this Agreement or (c) was in breach of
the General Partners fiduciary duty under Section 7.18(c). The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction
will not create a presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary
to that specified above.

Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) will be made only out of
the assets of the Partnership.



     | (b) | To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including,
without limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding will, from time to
time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition of any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of
an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay that amount if it
is determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Section 7.7. 
---|---|--- 
 



D-39  in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under
any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of Law or
otherwise, and will continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
the capacity that entitled it to such indemnification. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the
General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of
those Indemnitees (other than the General Partner itself) as the General
Partner determines, against any liability that may be asserted against or
expense that may be incurred by that Indemnitee in connection with the
Partnerships activities, whether or not the Partnership would have the power
to indemnify those Indemnitees against those liabilities under the provisions
of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   7.8 | _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The General Partner may rely and will be protected in acting
or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,

debenture, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The General Partner may consult with legal counsel,
accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other
consultants and advisors selected by it, and any act taken or omitted in
reliance upon the opinion (including, without limitation, an opinion of
counsel) of any of those Persons as to matters that the General Partner
reasonably believes to be within that Persons professional or expert
competence will be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good
faith and in accordance with that opinion. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The General Partner has the right, in respect of any of its
power, authority or obligations under this Agreement, to act through any of
its duly authorized officers.  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(i) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of the General Partners or any
other Indemnitees duties or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of
the General Partner or any other Indemnitee for the Indemnitee (other than the
General Partner) to engage in such business interests and activities in
preference to or to the exclusion of any Group Member, (iii) the General
Partner and the Indemnitees shall have no obligation hereunder or as a result
of any duty otherwise existing at Law or otherwise to present business
opportunities to any Group Member and (iv) the doctrine of "corporate
opportunity" or other analogous doctrine shall not apply to any such
Indemnitee. 
---|---|--- 
 



D-40  ---|---

ARTICLE 2

_EXCHANGE OF EXCHANGEABLE UNITS BY HOLDER _



   2.1 | _Exchange Right_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) | From and after the end of the Restricted Period, a holder of
such series of Exchangeable Units shall, from time to time in accordance with
this Article 2, have the right to require the Partnership to repurchase (the
"Exchange Right") any or all of the Exchangeable Units of such series held by
such holder for either (A) the Exchanged Shares or (B) the Cash Amount, the
form of consideration to be determined by the General Partner for and on
behalf of the Partnership in its sole discretion. Written notice of the
determination of the form of consideration shall be given to the holder of the
Exchangeable Units exercising the Exchange Right no later than 5 Business
Days after receipt of a given Exchange Notice. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

To exercise the Exchange Right, the holder shall present and surrender at the
office of the Partnership (or at any office of the Registrar and
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Partnership by notice to the
holders of Exchangeable Units) (i) a duly executed Exchange Notice and (ii)
the certificate or certificates, if any, representing the Exchangeable Units
which the holder desires to have exchanged, together with (iii) such
additional documents and instruments as the Registrar and Transfer Agent may
reasonably require pursuant to its standard and customary practices (but, in
any event, excluding any representations and  

---|---|--- 
 



D-59  required by law (e.g., Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8 or W-9); _provided_
, _however_ , that, with respect to any exercise of the Exchange Right prior
to the third anniversary of the Unit Effective Time, unless waived by
Holdings, it shall be a further condition precedent to the obligation of the
Partnership to repurchase such Units, and the Holder of such Units shall not
be permitted to exercise an Exchange Right, unless: (x) Holdings has received
a written opinion (a "7874 Opinion") of Ernst and Young LLP (or if Ernst and Young
LLP is unwilling or unable to perform, another independent nationally
recognized law or accounting firm) (the "Tax Firm") to the effect that the
exercise of such Exchange Right should not cause Holdings to be treated as (1)
a "surrogate foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section
7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code) or (2) a "domestic corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 7874(b) of the Code) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
successor sections of the Code with respect to (1) and (2) above following
any change in law) and (y) Holdings independent auditor has determined (an
"Auditor Determination") that no reserve shall be required for financial
accounting purposes (pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 48, as such guidance may be modified by future FASB
interpretations, statements, or other FASB guidance) relating to Code Section
7874 of the Code as a result of the exercise of such Exchange Right. The
Exchange Notice shall (A) specify the number of Exchangeable Units in respect
of which the holder is exercising the Exchange Right (the "Subject Units") and
(B) state the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the
Partnership exchange the Subject Units (the "Exchange Date"); _provided_ ,
that (x) the Exchange Date must be within 10 Business Days of the date on
which the Exchange Notice is received by the Partnership (unless otherwise
extended by Holdings in connection with obtaining the 7874 Opinion and Auditor
Determination as provided herein) and (y) each holder of Exchangeable Units,
together with its Affiliates, may submit only one Exchange Notice per
calendar month. 
---|--- 



     | (c) |

Holdings shall act in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the 7874 Opinion and the Auditor Determination as soon as
reasonably practical following the exercise by a holder of an Exchange Right.
In furtherance of the foregoing, to better ensure that the analysis necessary
to obtain the 7874 Opinion and the Auditor Determination can be completed as
soon as practicable following the date on which a holder exercises an
Exchange Right, prior to the end of the Restricted Period, Holdings shall (i)
retain the Tax Firm to (a) deliver to Holdings a 7874 Opinion (based on the
assumption that the Exchange Date is the day immediately following the last
day of the Restricted Period), or to do all work necessary to render such an
opinion and (b) "bring down" or otherwise render such an opinion (assuming no
change in law or fact would prevent it from doing so) at each such time that
a holder exercises an Exchange Right (unless Holdings intends to waive the
7874 Opinion condition) and (ii) retain its independent auditor to complete
the work that would be required for the auditor to make the Auditor
Determination (based on the assumption that the Exchange Date is the day
immediately following the last day of the Restricted Period). At the request 

---|---|--- 
 



D-60  consulting with its auditor and the Tax Firm) will promptly notify such holder
(x) whether the 7874 Opinion or the Auditor Determination can reasonably be
expected to be obtained based on the facts and law in effect at the time of
such request or (y) whether or not the Partnership would be prepared to waive
the requirement that the 7874 Opinion or the Auditor Determination would be
required in connection with a given Exchange Notice. 
---|--- 



   2.2 | _Share Settlement Option_ 
---|--- 

If the General Partner elects to repurchase the Subject Units for Holdings
Shares, and provided that the Exchange Notice is not revoked by the holder in
the manner specified in Section 2.5 of this Schedule A, effective at the
close of business on the Exchange Date:



     | (a) | the Partnership shall have, and shall be deemed to have,
repurchased the Subject Units for cancellation in consideration for the
transfer to such holder of the applicable number of Exchanged Shares and such
holder shall be deemed to have transferred to the Partnership all of such
holders right, title and interest in and to the Subject Units; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Holdings shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to such
holder, for and on behalf of the Partnership and in the manner provided for in
Section 2.4 of this Schedule A, the applicable number of Exchanged Shares;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Partnership shall issue to Holdings a number of Common
Units equal to the number of Exchanged Shares delivered to such holder
pursuant to Section 3.2(b), in consideration for Holdings delivering such
Exchanged Shares to such holder. 
---|---|--- 



   2.3 | _Cash Settlement Option_ 
---|--- 

If the General Partner elects to repurchase the Subject Units for the Cash
Amount, and provided that the Exchange Notice is not revoked by the holder in
the manner specified in Section 2.5 of this Schedule A, effective at the
close of business on the Exchange Date:



     | (a) | the Partnership shall have, and shall be deemed to have,
repurchased the Subject Units for cancellation in consideration for the
payment to such holder of the aggregate Cash Amount and such holder shall be
deemed to have transferred to the Partnership all of such holders right,
title and interest in and to the Subject Units; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Partnership shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to
such holder the applicable Cash Amount. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.4 | _Effect of Exchange_ 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Subject to compliance by the applicable holder of the Subject Units with the
terms of this Schedule A, the Partnership (or Holdings for and on behalf of
the Partnership) shall deliver or cause the Registrar and Transfer Agent to
deliver to 

---|---|--- 
 



D-61  Exchanged Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-
assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), or
(ii) a check representing the applicable Cash Amount, in each case, less any
amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement,
and such delivery by or on behalf of the Partnership or by the Registrar and
Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and
discharge all liability for the total consideration payable or issuable. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | On and after the close of business on the Exchange Date, the
holders of the Subject Units shall cease to be holders of such Subject Units
and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive the applicable consideration,
unless payment of the consideration is not made in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 2. On and after the close of business on the
Exchange Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates (if
applicable) and payment of the applicable consideration has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Subject Units
exchanged for Holdings Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be a holder of the Holdings Shares delivered to it. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | As a condition to delivery of the consideration, the
Partnership and the Registrar and Transfer Agent may require presentation and
surrender at the office of the Partnership (or at any office of the Registrar
and Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Partnership) of such documents
and instruments as are contemplated by Section 2.1(b). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding Section 2.4(b) of this Schedule A, where a
record date in respect of a distribution occurs prior to the Exchange Date and
there is any declared and unpaid distribution on any Exchangeable Unit
exchanged hereunder, subject to Section 4.1 of this Schedule A, such
distribution shall remain payable and shall be paid in the applicable form on
the designated payment date to the former holder of the Exchangeable Unit so
exchanged hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If only a part of the Exchangeable Units represented by any
certificate is exchanged, a new certificate for the balance of such
Exchangeable Units shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the
Partnership. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | All filing fees, transfer taxes, sales taxes, document
stamps or other similar charges levied by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the repurchase of the Exchangeable Units pursuant to this
Agreement shall be paid by the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
holder of such Exchangeable Units shall pay any such fees, taxes, stamps or
similar charges that may be payable as a result of any transfer of the
consideration payable in respect of such Exchangeable Units to a Person other
than such holder. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party
will bear its own costs in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



D-62  ---|--- 
 

A holder of Subject Units may, by notice in writing given by the holder to the
Partnership before the close of business on the 5th Business Day immediately
preceding the Exchange Date, withdraw its Exchange Notice, in which event such
Exchange Notice shall be null and void.



   2.6 | _Mandatory Exchange_ 
---|--- 
 

In the event that:



     | (a) | at any time there remain outstanding fewer than five percent
(5%) of the Exchangeable Units outstanding as of the Unit Effective Time
(other than Exchangeable Units held by Holdings and as such number of Units
may be adjusted in accordance with the Agreement to give effect to a
Combination or Subdivision of, or unit distribution on, the Exchangeable
Units, or any issue or distribution of rights to acquire Exchangeable Units
or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Exchangeable Units
following the Unit Effective Time); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | a Holdings Control Transaction occurs with respect to which
the General Partner has determined in good faith that such Holdings Control
Transaction involves a bona fide third party and is not for the primary
purpose of causing the exchange of the Exchangeable Units in connection with
such Holdings Control Transaction, 
---|---|--- 

then on prior written notice given by the Partnership to the holders of
Exchangeable Units at least fifteen days prior to such mandatory exchange, in
the case of the foregoing Sections 2.6(a) and 2.6(b), and on the Business Day
following the day on which the holders of the Exchangeable Units failed to
take such action in the case of the foregoing Section 2.6(c), the Partnership
may cause a mandatory exchange of all of the outstanding Exchangeable Units
(which shall be deemed to be the Subject Units), on such date as is specified
by the Partnership in such notice (which shall be deemed to be the Exchange
Date), pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Schedule A, and for greater certainty,
the holders of Exchangeable Units shall not have the right to revoke such
mandatory exchange pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Schedule A.



   2.7 | _Attached Voting Shares_ 
---|--- 

In the event that Attached Voting Shares are issued in conjunction with the
Exchangeable Units, then for all purposes of this Agreement (including for all
purposes of this Schedule A) each and every reference to an Exchangeable Unit
shall be deemed also to refer to a corresponding number of Attached Voting
Shares, and no Exchangeable Unit may be transferred, presented for exchange,
or otherwise conveyed in any manner whatsoever unless accompanied by a
corresponding number of Attached Voting Shares.



   2.8 | _Direct Exchange Right of Holdings_ 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 2 of this Schedule A or
Section 3.4(c) of the Agreement, Holdings may to the extent required by Law or
otherwise in its sole discretion, elect to effect the exchange of Subject
Units for Exchanged Shares or the Cash Amount through a direct exchange of
such Units and consideration between the holders of such Units and

 



D-63   Holdings (a "Direct Exchange"). Holdings may, at any time prior to an
Exchange Date, deliver written notice (a "Direct Exchange Notice") to the
Partnership and the holder of any Subject Units setting forth its election to
exercise its right to consummate a Direct Exchange. A Direct Exchange Notice
may be revoked by Holdings at any time; _provided_ , that any such revocation
does not prejudice the ability of the holders of Subject Units to consummate
their Exchange Right on the Exchange Date. Upon Direct Exchange pursuant to
this Section 2.8, Holdings shall acquire the Subject Units and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Units;
_provided_ , that in the hands of Holdings such Units shall be Common Units.
Except as otherwise provided by this Section 2.8, a Direct Exchange shall be
consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the
relevant exchange would have been consummated if Holdings had not delivered a
Direct Exchange Notice.
