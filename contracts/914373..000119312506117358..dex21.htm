-iii- _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 22, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ "),
among ARGILA, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "),
WHISKEY MERGER CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Sub_ "), and JAMESON INNS, INC., a Georgia corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company and the sole
member of Parent have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and
into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $0.10 per
share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by Parent,
Sub or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and certain shareholders of the Company (the " _Principal Company
Shareholders_ ") are entering into an agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ "
and, together with this Agreement, the " _Transaction Agreements_ ") pursuant
to which the Principal Company Shareholders will agree to take specified
actions in furtherance of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and
also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Georgia Business
Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the GBCC and the DGCL. At
the election of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger.
In such event, the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing. The Merger, the payments of the
Merger Consideration, the Charter Amendment, and the other transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements are referred to in this Agreement
collectively as the " _Transactions_."

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of OÂ’Melveny and Myers LLP, Times Square Tower, 7
Times Square, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business
day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver
by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such
day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied
(or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof), as soon as practicable after all of the conditions set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by
the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date._ "

SECTION 1.03.  _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare,
and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter Parent shall file
with the Secretary of State of (i) the State of Georgia, a certificate of
merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Georgia
Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the GBCC and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
GBCC and (ii) the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Delaware Certificate of
Merger_ " and, together with the Georgia Certificate of Merger, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificates of Merger are duly filed with such Secretaries of State, or at
such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificates of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.04. Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
14-2-1106 of the GBCC and Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) The Articles of
Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit B,
and, as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06. _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.



 

-2- _ARTICLE II_

Effect on the Capital Stock of the

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

(i) Subject to Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.01(d), each issued
and outstanding share (or a fraction thereof) of Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive $2.97 (or the appropriate fraction
thereof, in the case of a fractional share) in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of
such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest, and except
as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Unpaid Dividends.

(d) _Dissent Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissent Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair
value of such Dissent Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Article 13 of the GBCC (" _Article 13_ ") shall not be converted into
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Dissent Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such
Dissent Shares in accordance with Article 13; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to receive payment of fair market value under Article 13 then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Dissent
Shares shall cease and such Dissent Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c) and Unpaid Dividends as provided in Section 2.02(c). The Company shall
serve



 

-3- prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for payment of
the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon
surrender of certificates representing Company Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent all the cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (or, in the case of certificates that represent shares
of Signature Inns, Inc. which have not as of the Effective Time been
surrendered for certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, the
right to receive shares of Company Common Stock) whose shares were converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Subject to Section 2.01(d) and except as otherwise provided with respect to
Unpaid Dividends in Section 2.02(c), until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.02. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



 

-4- (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with (and not in violation of)
the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time (collectively, " _Unpaid Dividends_ "),
and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate would irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either MoodyÂ’s Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
or a combination thereof; _provided_ that, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months from the date of the
investment therein. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the property of and shall be paid to Parent.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent determines in its sole
discretion may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign
tax Law.



 

-5- (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate.

Company SEC Documents or in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
communication during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that

and assets and to carry on its business and operations as now conducted,
except where the failure to obtain any such Permit, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There has occurred no default under, or violation of, any such Permit,
except for defaults under, or violations of, Permits, except where such
default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Merger, in and of



 

-17- itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that

director or executive officer or other relationship of any influence
whatsoever) or otherwise and/or (y) having an agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to, or having discussions with respect to, any of
the matters in clause (x). The term " _associate_ " has the meaning assigned

(b) Subject to Section 5.02(c), from the Solicitation Period End Date until
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or

Representative of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, (i) directly or

may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or

Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.02(b) by the Company. Subject to Section 5.02(c), on the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall immediately cease
any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion, negotiation or other
action permitted by Section 5.02(a) conducted by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives regarding any proposal

Takeover Proposal.



 

-28- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(b), from the
Solicitation Period End Date and prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited Company
Takeover Proposal which did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(b), or a
solicited Company Takeover Proposal which did not result from a breach of
Section 5.02(a), and which, in either case, the Company Board determines, in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and independent financial
advisors, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Company Proposal, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive of the other
party than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal.

(d) Subject to Section 8.01(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub,
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the Charter

or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal (any of the actions or events

accordance with Section 8.05(b); _provided_ , that the Company shall have
complied with all provisions thereof.

(e) The Company promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or, following
the Solicitation Period End Date, any inquiry with respect to or that would

including any change to the terms, of any such Company Takeover Proposal or

taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure required under applicable Law (including accurate disclosure of the
factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or the fact that a Company Takeover Proposal has
been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the terms of such
proposal to the extent such factual information is required to be disclosed
under applicable Law) to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with



 

-29- outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof take, agree or
resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 5.02(d). Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 5.02, none of the Company, the Company Board or any
committee thereof shall take, agree or resolve to take any action that would
result in the CompanyÂ’s shareholders no longer being legally capable under the
GBCC of validly approving this Agreement, the Merger and the Charter
Amendment.

Transactions.

Company (x) with respect to such a proposal made by a Solicited Person, for
exclusively cash consideration and (y) with respect to such a proposal made by
all other such third parties, for cash consideration and/or equity securities
generally entitled to vote for the election of directors and listed on the
New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or quoted on the
Nasdaq National Market (or a successor to the Nasdaq National Market) (such
equity securities, " _Equity Securities_ "), and in any case pursuant to a
tender offer or exchange offer, a merger or a consolidation, or a sale of all
or substantially all of its assets, (i) on terms which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial
advisors, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders
of Company Common Stock than the Transactions, taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the Transactions or this Agreement (
_provided_ , that for purposes of determining the value of any Equity
Securities in connection with assessing favorability from a financial point of
view, the value of such Equity Securities (1) shall be deemed to be equal to
the lower of (A) the average closing price for such securities for the 30
consecutive trading days ending on the day (the " _Determination Date_ ") that
immediately precedes the date on which a Superior Proposal Determination is
made with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal and (B) the closing price
of such Equity Securities on the Determination Date, and (2) except as
specified in clause (1) shall be deemed not to include any other measure of
value), (ii) that is not subject to any financing condition or contingency and
(iii) that would reasonably be expected to be capable of being completed,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of
such proposal.

with Parent and Sub in connection with their efforts to obtain any financing
utilized by Parent or Sub in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, including providing, in accordance with the terms of Section
6.02, reasonably required information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the financial institution or institutions providing such
financing and executing and delivering, and causing such Company Subsidiaries
to execute and deliver, customary certificates or other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary to such financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with such financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no obligation
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any such certificate, document
or instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with
such financing prior to the Effective Time.

SECTION 6.04. _Company Stock Options_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the stock plans of
the Company (" _Company Stock Plans_ ")) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as are required to (A) adjust the terms of all outstanding
Company Employee Stock Options and all outstanding Company stock
appreciation rights (each a " _Company SAR_ ") heretofore granted under any
Company Stock Plan to provide that each Company Employee Stock Option (and any
Company SAR related thereto) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment by the Company at the
Effective Time of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Employee Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Employee Stock Option
shall not theretofore have been exercised and (B) cause the vesting of the
Restricted Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. As used
herein, " _Company Employee Stock Option_ " means any option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted to any employee, director, independent
contractor or other service provider of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.



 

-33- (b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time. The Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain all consents of the holders of the Company Employee Stock
Options and the holders of the Restricted Company Shares as shall be
necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, payment shall, at ParentÂ’s request, be
withheld in respect of any Company Employee Stock Option and Restricted
Company Share until all necessary consents are obtained.

SECTION 6.05. _Benefit Plans_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Benefit Plans to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party as in effect on the
date hereof, to the extent such Company Benefit Plans are binding obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Nothing herein is intended to
restrict, and neither the Company nor any Company Benefit Plan has taken or
shall take any action that restricts, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s right to
terminate or amend any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms
thereof. Nothing in this Section 6.05, expressed or implied, shall be
construed as giving any Person (including, without limitation, any employee or
beneficiary thereof) other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as
in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the CompanyÂ’s employment,
severance and termination agreements, plans and policies disclosed in Section
6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) To the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall
cause any payments due to employees at Closing pursuant to the plans or
agreements set forth on Section 6.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter to be
paid in a lump sum at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
payment of any "deferred compensation" to a "specified employee" (in each
case, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the published
guidance thereunder) may be postponed until six months after the Effective
Time solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of tax under
Section 409A of the Code.

SECTION 6.06.  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all the CompanyÂ’s obligations to indemnify the
current or former directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (the " _Covered Persons_ ") for acts or omissions by
such Covered Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent that
such obligations of the Company exist on the date of this Agreement, whether
pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or individual indemnity or
other agreements to which such Covered Persons are a party, and such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
and such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims
against such Covered Persons arising out of such acts or omissions. Parent
shall, to the fullest



 

-34- extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to advance funds for
expenses incurred by Covered Persons so indemnified in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding relating to the indemnification
obligations referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it
shall be ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to the
indemnification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of
the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium. 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless any Covered Person who acts or has acted as a fiduciary
under any Company Benefit Plan (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneysÂ’
fees and disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (in
the case of settlements, with the approval of the indemnifying party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)) (collectively, " _Losses_ "),
as incurred (payable monthly upon written request which request shall include
reasonable evidence of the Losses set forth therein) to the extent arising
from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection with such
Indemnified PartyÂ’s duties as an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, including in respect of this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification
under this Section 6.06(c) for Losses arising out of actions or omissions by
the Indemnified Party constituting (i) a breach of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, (ii) criminal conduct or (iii) any violation of
federal, state or foreign securities laws.

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this Section 6.06.



 

-35- (e) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.06, and this Section 6.06 shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

SECTION 6.07. _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 6.07, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee if: (i) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); (ii) Parent terminates
this Agreement pursuant to 8.01(d); or (iii) (A) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII, any person makes a Company Takeover Proposal or amends a Company
Takeover Proposal made prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) this Agreement
is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)
or Section 8.01(b)(iv) (but only if such Company Takeover Proposal is publicly
announced at or prior to the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (C) within 12 months after the date of
such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate,
or consummates, the transactions contemplated by such Company Takeover
Proposal. Solely for the purposes of clause (iii)(C) of the first sentence of
this Section 6.07(b), the term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(g), except that all references
to " _20%_ " shall be changed to " _40%._ " The term " _Termination Fee_ "
shall mean (i) $2,500,000 in the event this Agreement is terminated at or
prior to the time of the Solicitation Period End Date and (ii) $5,000,000 in
the event this Agreement is terminated after the time of the Solicitation
Period End Date. Any Termination Fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be
paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this
Agreement (except that in the case of termination pursuant to clause (iii) of
the first sentence of this Section 6.07(b), such payment shall be made on the
date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of
such transactions). The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 6.07(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 6.07(b) as and when due, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b), the Company shall
pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b) at the prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
It is expressly acknowledged that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the fee referred to in this Section 6.07(b) on more than one occasion.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent as provided in Section 8.01(c),
then the Company shall pay to Parent, forthwith upon demand by Parent, the
Expenses incurred by Parent, up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate. " _Expenses_ "
means all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses payable to all banks, investment banking



 

-36- firms, other financial institutions, and other persons and their respective
agents and counsel, for arranging or structuring the Transactions, and all
reasonable fees of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent (in
the case of Section 6.07(c)) or the Company (in the case of Section 6.07(d)),
and all printing and advertising expenses) actually incurred by banks,
investment banking firms, other financial institutions and other persons, and
assumed by Parent (in the case of Section 6.07(c)) or the Company (in the case
of Section 6.07(d)) in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the structuring of the
Transactions and any agreements relating thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company be obligated to reimburse any fees
or expenses directly or indirectly attributable to the preparation and
submission of the Notice of Intention to Nominate Candidates for Election to
the Board of Directors of Jameson Inns, Inc. and to Propose Other Business,
Including the Removal of Incumbent Directors by Cede and Co., on behalf of
Argila, LLC, dated April 21, 2006 and addressed to the Company.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company as provided in Section
8.01(e), then Parent shall pay to the Company, forthwith upon demand by the
Company, the Expenses incurred by the Company, up to $1,000,000 in the
aggregate.

SECTION 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult
with each other before issuing, and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

SECTION 6.09. _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Sub and Parent in
preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

SECTION 6.10. _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any Transaction,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

SECTION 6.11. _Other Actions by Parent_. Parent shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates not to, take any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the Merger set
forth in Article VII not being satisfied.

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before December 31, 2006 (the "
_Outside Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result
of a willful and material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the passage of such

subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining

Approval, the Company Shareholder Approval is not obtained; 

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material

rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer;

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform in any

amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company

-41- SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_.

(a) A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, to the extent
permitted by law, the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors. 

(b) The Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
Section 5.02(d) or the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), in each case, at a time prior to receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval only if: (1) the Company Board has received a Superior
Company Proposal; (2) in light of such Superior Company Proposal the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (any such determination, a " _Superior Proposal
Determination_ "); (3) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it has
made a Superior Proposal Determination (any such notice, a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") and provided Parent a copy of the document
and/or agreement providing for the Superior Company Proposal (including any
other documents or agreements referred to in or entered into in connection
with the Superior Company Proposal relating thereto); (4) at least five
business days following receipt by Parent of the Superior Proposal Notice
(such time period, the " _Notice Period_ "), and taking into account any
revised proposal (including any proposal to amend the terms of the
Transactions or this Agreement) made by Parent since receipt of the Superior
Proposal Notice, such Superior Company Proposal remains a Superior Company
Proposal and the Company Board has again made a Superior Proposal
Determination; (5) the Company is in compliance, in all material respects,
with Section 5.02; (6) in the case of a termination by the Company of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), the Company has previously paid the
Termination Fee due under Section 6.07; (7) in the case of a termination by
the Company of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), the Company Board
concurrently approves, and the Company concurrently enters into, a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Company Proposal; and (8) Parent is not at such time entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(d)(ii)(A). The
Company acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification to the
financial terms or other material terms of a Company Takeover Proposal that is
determined to be a Superior Company Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a
new Superior Company Proposal for purposes of this Section 8.05(b) and shall
trigger a new Notice Period.
