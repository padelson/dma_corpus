adjustments. Any disagreements in respect thereof will be resolved in
substantially the same manner as in respect of a dispute regarding the Final
Closing Cash Adjustment under _Section 2.6(b)_.

(d) _Treatment of Payments Pursuant to this Agreement_. The parties agree that
any payment made pursuant to this Agreement in excess of the Base Purchase
Price will be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price
of the Purchased Assets, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law. Solely
for Tax purposes, Section 483 of the Code or any succeeding or corresponding
provision of applicable Law shall apply to the extent necessary to
characterize portions of the Purchase Price (including the Contingent
Payments) as interest payments, and the parties hereby agree to so treat them.

Purchase Price and the amount of Assumed Liabilities for income tax purposes

of the Disclosure Schedules hereto (the " _General Allocation_ "), which shall
be agreed by the parties before the Closing and satisfy Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. As soon as
practicable after an adjustment to the Purchase Price has been determined
pursuant to _Section 2.6 _or a Contingent Payment pursuant to _Section 2.9_
has been made, Buyer shall deliver Seller a statement (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ "), allocating such adjustment to the Purchase Price or such
Contingent Payment (except for any interest payable thereon and as adjusted,
if required, pursuant to Section 483 of the Code) to the Purchased Assets.
The Proposed Allocation shall satisfy Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If within twenty (20) days after
Buyer has provided the Proposed Allocation to Seller, Seller has not objected
in writing to the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become
the final allocation (each, a " _Final Allocation_ "). Otherwise, Seller and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon the Final Allocation.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the Final



 

29 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Allocation within a 60-day period from the receipt of notice from the Seller
objecting to the Proposed Allocation, then all remaining disputed items shall
be submitted to the Independent Firm. The Independent Firm shall be
instructed to use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer and Seller a
written report setting forth the resolution of each disputed matter within
thirty (30) days of submission and, in any case, as promptly as practicable
after such submission. The Independent Firms determination with respect to
the disputed items in the Proposed Allocation shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Seller and Buyer absent manifest error. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Firm shall be shared equally between Seller
and Buyer. The General Allocation and the Final Allocation (together, the "
_Allocations_ ") shall be amended to reflect any other adjustment to the
Purchase Price hereunder consistent with the General Allocation and Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Seller

such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that the
Indemnified Party does not assume the defense of any matter as provided above

amount of such Losses in excess of such amount.

(b) An Indemnifying Party will have no liability for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)_ or _8.3(a)_ after the Indemnifying Party has made
aggregate indemnification payments equal to (i) in the case of Seller, amounts
in excess of the Escrow Fund and (ii) in the case of Buyer $187,500,000.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _Sections 8.6(a)_ and
_8.6(b)_ shall not apply to (i) indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_
or _Section 8.3(a)_ in respect of the Fundamental Representations, as
applicable or (ii) indemnification for any breach of any of the Indemnifying
Partys representations and warranties that constitutes fraud.

(d) All indemnification payments to be made by Seller under _Section 8.2,_
other than those referred to in _Section 8.6(e)_, may be made, in whole or
in part, at the election of the Indemnified Party from either the Escrow Fund
or the Holdback Amount or otherwise.

(e) All indemnification payments to be made by Seller under _Section 8.2(a)_
(other than in respect of the Fundamental Representations) shall be made
solely from the Escrow Fund.

(f) Seller shall have no right of contribution against the Acquired Business
with respect to any breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or

 agreements. Any Losses incurred by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller on the
other hand, for any claim or series of related claims shall be aggregated
for purposes of applying this _Section 8.6. _

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Liability of (i) Seller in respect of
Excluded Liabilities or for breach of the Fundamental Representations or
breach of covenants other than those to be performed on or prior to the
Closing and (ii) Buyer in respect of Assumed Liabilities or of the
Fundamental Representations or for breach of covenants other than those to be
performed on or prior to the Closing shall not be subject to any limitation as
to amount (including any so called "cap" or basket or deduction or other
similar concept) or time, it being expressly understood that such Liability
shall survive indefinitely without any such limitation.

(h) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was reflected
in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.6_. 

 Section 8.7 _Subrogation_. The rights of any Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Party may have against
any other Person with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in pursuing any subrogated right.

 Section 8.8 _Procedures Related to Tax Contests_.

(a) If any Tax Contest commenced or initiated against Buyer by any taxing
authority after the date hereof, would, if successful, require Seller to make
an indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 8.2_, Seller shall have the right
(but not the obligation), upon timely written notice, to elect to control,
defend, settle, compromise, or contest such Tax Contest; _provided, however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) Seller
shall keep Buyer fully informed of any proceedings, events and developments
related to or in connection with such Tax Contest; (ii) Buyer shall be
entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and documents related to such
Tax Contest; (iii) Seller shall consult with Buyer and shall not enter into
any settlement with respect to any such Tax Contest without Buyers prior
written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and (iv) at its own cost and expense, Buyer shall have the right
to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest. Except
as provided in subsection (iv) above, the costs and expenses (including the
cost of counsel) incurred in contesting any such Tax Contest shall be borne by
Seller. Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice of any Tax Contest
(which in any event shall be within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of
such Tax Contest) which may give rise to any indemnity obligation under
_Section 8.2._ Failure to give prompt notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations thereunder in absence of actual prejudice. Buyer
and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in pursuing such Tax
Contest. Seller shall reimburse Buyer and/or such Affiliates for any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation, including the
cost of counsel. If Seller does not elect to control such Tax Contest, Buyer
shall control such Tax Contest but shall provide Seller the same rights that
Buyer has in the event Seller elects to control such Tax Contest pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iv) above.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall not
have the right to control, defend, settle, compromise or contest any Tax
Contest to the extent that Buyer and its Affiliates waive their right to
indemnification from Seller with respect to such Tax Contest.

 Section 8.9 _Insurance_. The amount of any Losses suffered by an Indemnified
Party shall be reduced by any insurance or other benefits which such party or
its Affiliates actually receive in respect of or as a result of such Losses
or the facts or circumstances relating thereto.

 Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Modifications_.

(a) The agreement of the parties, which consists of this Agreement and the
Disclosure Schedules and Ancillary Agreements to which such parties are the
sole parties, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the
parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, written or oral,
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(b) This Agreement may be modified and/or amended with respect to any
provision contained herein at any time by written action of Buyer and Seller.

 Section 9.4 _Waiver_. Any term or condition hereof may be waived at any time
by the party hereto that is entitled to the benefits thereof by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to
be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of
this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held
to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 Section 9.5 _Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
transferred, assigned or delegated by any of the parties hereto, in whole or
in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempt to make any such transfer, assignment or delegation without such
consent shall be null and void; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall be
permitted to assign its rights (but not its obligations) hereunder, in whole
or in part to one or more of its Affiliates. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. The provisions
of this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more
provisions are deemed illegal or  



 

84 ##### Table of Contents

  

 unenforceable the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
unless the deletion of such provision shall cause this Agreement to
become materially adverse to any party, in which event the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrive at an accommodation that best preserves for
the parties the benefits and obligations of the offending provision.

 Section 9.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available,
will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents
to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction
as provided in _Section 9.8_ to compel performance of such partys
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual damages and
without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Such remedy
shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a partys breach of its
obligations but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law
or equity.

 Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This agreement shall be governed by and
construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
(other than its conflict of law principles to the extent that the application
of the Laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby, but with
reference to Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, which by
its terms applies to this Agreement).

 Section 9.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, and (b) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any Action arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no
such Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought by it except in such courts). The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to
the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or that any such Action brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto
also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in
connection with any Action shall be conclusive and binding on such party and
that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such award or judgment.

 Section 9.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, and agrees to
cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party (a) certifies
that no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly
or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of an Action,
seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and



 

85 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been induced to
enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications in this _Section 9.9_.

 Section 9.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 Section 9.12 _Guarantee of Buyer Parent_.

(a) Buyer Parent is executing this Agreement to guarantee the performance by
Buyer of its payment and performance obligations under this Agreement. Buyer
Parent hereby guarantees unconditionally Buyers payment obligations in and
performance under this Agreement. This guarantee shall apply regardless of
any amendments, variations, alterations, waivers or extensions to this
Agreement whether or not Buyer Parent received notice of the same and Buyer
Parent waives all need for notice of the same. Buyer Parent agrees to deliver
or cause to be delivered one or more certificates representing the Stock
Consideration at Closing as contemplated by _Section 2.8_ and _Section 2.9_.

(b) Buyer Parent is an entity duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Buyer Parent has
the requisite organizational power and authority to carry on its business and
to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets as currently owned,
leased or operated. Buyer Parent is duly qualified to do business
under applicable Law in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or
operated by it makes such qualification necessary, other than any failure to
be so qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material
nor would have a material impact on the ability of Buyer Parent timely to
perform its obligations contemplated hereby.

(c) Buyer Parent has full requisite organizational power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement to perform its obligations hereunder and
to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer Parent of this Agreement have been, and the consummation of its
obligations hereunder has been, duly and validly authorized and approved by
all necessary corporate or other action of Buyer Parent, and no further
approval by Buyer Parent or other corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer
Parent is necessary to authorize this Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Buyer Parent, as applicable, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Seller) this Agreement constitutes, a valid and binding obligation
of Buyer Parent enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
that (a) the enforceability hereof or thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally,
including the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent
conveyances and preferential transfers and (b) the availability of equitable

 remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability,
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity.
