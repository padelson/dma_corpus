2    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 26, 2000, among  ALCON
HOLDINGS INC., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), ALCON  ACQUISITION CORP., a
Massachusetts corporation ("SUB") and a  wholly owned subsidiary of Parent,
and SUMMIT AUTONOMOUS INC., a  Massachusetts corporation (the "COMPANY")
(formerly known as  Summit Technology, Inc.).    WHEREAS the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the
acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of such
acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may

to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), including the associated
Company Rights (as defined in Section 3.03), at a price per share of Company
Common Stock (including the associated Company Right) of $19.00, net to the
seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;   WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved the merger (the "MERGER") of Sub into the Company,
or (at the election of Parent) the Company into Sub, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of
Company Common Stock not owned directly by Parent or the Company, other than
Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(d)), shall be converted into the
right to receive the highest per share cash consideration paid pursuant to
the Offer; and    3    2    WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Offer and the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties
hereto agree as follows:    ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND THE MERGER  
SECTION 1.01. THE OFFER. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event
later than five business days after the public announcement of
this Agreement), Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence the Offer
within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The obligation of Sub to, and of Parent
to cause Sub to, commence the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to
the conditions set forth in Exhibit A. The initial expiration date of the
Offer shall be the 20th business day following the commencement of the
Offer (determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT")). Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or modify
the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the Company, Sub
shall not and Parent shall not permit Sub to (i) reduce the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the price per share
of Company Common Stock to be paid pursuant to the Offer, (iii) waive or
change the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit A), (iv) modify in
any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or add to the
conditions set forth in Exhibit A, (v) except as provided in the next
sentence, extend the Offer or (vi) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (A) if at the scheduled or any extended expiration date of the
Offer (whether extended pursuant to this clause (A) or otherwise) any of the
conditions to Sub\'s obligation to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
are not satisfied or waived, extend the Offer for such period as Sub
determines; PROVIDED that such extension shall be in increments of not more
than five business days if all of the conditions set    4   
3   forth in Exhibit A other than the Minimum Tender Condition have been
satisfied or waived at such scheduled or extended expiration date, (B) extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer and (C) if
at the scheduled or any extended expiration date of the Offer less than 90%
of the Fully Diluted Shares (as defined in Exhibit A) have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer, extend the Offer for a period of not
more than ten business days in the aggregate beyond the latest expiration
date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (A) or (B) of this
sentence. In addition, Sub may make available a "subsequent offering period",
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act. In the event that the
Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied or waived at the scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, at the request of the Company, Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the expiration date of the Offer in such
increments as Sub may determine until the earliest to occur of (w) the
satisfaction or waiver of such condition, (x) Parent reasonably determines
that such condition to the Offer is not capable of being satisfied on or
prior to the Outside Date (as defined in Section 8.01(b)(i)), (y) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (z) the
Outside Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Sub shall accept for payment and pay for all shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon
as practicable after the expiration of the Offer.   (b) On the date of
commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain
an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent and
Sub shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer    5    4   Documents prior to their being
filed with the SEC or disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent
and Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any
comments Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of Parent or Sub to
such comments.   (c) Prior to the expiration of the Offer, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary
to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer.   SECTION 1.02. COMPANY ACTIONS. (a)
Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company hereby approves of and consents to
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the "TRANSACTIONS").   (b) On the date the Offer
Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer, including an information statement (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended
and supplemented from time to time, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9"), describing the
recommendations referred to in Section 3.04(b), or any permitted withdrawal
or modification in accordance with Section 5.02(b), and shall mail the
Schedule 14D-9 (including in the information statement) to the holders of
Company Common Stock. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company\'s stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel in writing with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments.   (c) In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Sub as promptly as is
reasonably practicable with mailing labels containing the names and addresses
of the record holders of Company Common    6    5   Stock as of a
recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information as Sub may reasonably
request in the Company\'s possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such information and
assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request
in communicating the Offer to the Company\'s stockholders. Subject to
the requirements of applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.05), and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Sub
shall hold in confidence pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.02) the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files, shall use such information only for the purpose of
communicating the Offer and disseminating any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company
all copies of such information then in their possession.   SECTION 1.03.
THE MERGER. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law (the "BCL"), Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.05).
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The Surviving Corporation shall possess all the
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub,
and the Surviving Corporation shall by operation of law become liable for all
of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub. The name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be Summit Autonomous Inc. and the purpose thereof
shall be as set forth in Section 2 of the Articles of Organization of the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may elect at any
time prior to the Merger, instead of merging Sub into the Company as provided
above, to merge the Company with and into Sub; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall not be deemed to have breached any of its representations,
warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement solely by reason of such
election. In such event, the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment
to this Agreement to reflect the foregoing. At the election of Parent, any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for
Sub as a constituent    7    6   corporation in the Merger. In such
event, the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement
in order to reflect the foregoing.   SECTION 1.04. CLOSING. The closing (the
"CLOSING") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and
Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the
second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted
by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Article VII, or
at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".   SECTION 1.05. EFFECTIVE TIME.
Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and give the Company and its
counsel the opportunity to review, and on the Closing Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter Parent shall file with the Secretary of State of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, articles of merger or other appropriate
documents (in any such case, the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the BCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the BCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or
at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").   SECTION 1.06. EFFECTS. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 80 of the BCL.   SECTION 1.07. ARTICLES OF
ORGANIZATION AND BY-LAWS. (a) The Articles of Organization of the Company
shall be amended and restated at the Effective Time to read in the form of
Exhibit B, and, as so amended, such Articles of Organization shall be the
Articles of Organization of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   (b) Subject
to Section 6.06, the By-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.  
SECTION 1.08. DIRECTORS. At the Closing, Parent shall designate the directors
of the Surviving Corporation and such directors shall hold office until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective   
8    7   successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be.   SECTION 1.09. OFFICERS. At the Closing, Parent shall designate
the officers of the Surviving Corporation and such officers shall hold office
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may
be.    ARTICLE II   EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE  CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   SECTION 2.01. EFFECT ON CAPITAL
STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares
of capital stock of Sub:   (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become
a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON
STOCK") equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common
Stock that are owned by any subsidiary of the Company or Parent other than
Sub) divided by (ii) 1,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the aggregate number
of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the capital stock
of Sub is to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) is not a whole
number, such number shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.  
(b) CANCELATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned directly by the Company, Parent or
Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by any subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than
Sub) shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.   (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY
COMMON STOCK. (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued share
of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the    9    
8   right to receive in cash the highest price per share of Company Common
Stock paid pursuant to the Offer.   (2) The cash payable upon the
conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c)
is referred to collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION". As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.   (d)
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares ("APPRAISAL SHARES") of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 86 through 97 of
the BCL (the "APPRAISAL PROVISIONS") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders
of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Provisions; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the Appraisal
Provisions, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   SECTION 2.02. EXCHANGE
OF CERTIFICATES. (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
select a bank or trust company in the United States, reasonably acceptable to
the Company, to act as paying agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the payment of
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing   
10    9   Company Common Stock. Parent shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on
a timely basis, as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary
to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). If for any reason (including losses) the
Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled under this Section 2.02(a), Parent
shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient
to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided
in this Agreement.   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction    11    10   of Parent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01. If any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be unable to surrender such holder\'s Certificates because such
Certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver
in lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity bond in form and substance and
with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.   (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (d)
TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration.   (e) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05)), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable    12    11   Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.   (f) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed
by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code (as defined in Section 3.11), or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.   (h) CHARGES AND
EXPENSES. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of cash
for shares of Company Common Stock.    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Sub as follows:   SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each
of the Company and each of its subsidiaries (the "COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES") is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals, and has made all filings, registrations and
declarations, in each case whether domestic or foreign, necessary to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct
its businesses as presently conducted, including all licenses, approvals and
registrations by or with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"),
and all other Governmental Entities performing similar functions, necessary
for the sale and distribution of its products in all jurisdictions in which
such products are sold or distributed, in each case other than such
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, approvals, filings,
registrations and declarations the lack of which, individually and in the
aggregate, has not had and would not    13     12   reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, a material adverse effect on the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (a "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT"). The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or their
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary
except where the failure to so qualify has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles of organization
of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the
"COMPANY CHARTER"), and the by-laws of the Company, as amended to the date of
this Agreement (as so amended, the "COMPANY BY-LAWS"), and the comparable
charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, in each case
as amended through the date of this Agreement.   SECTION 3.02. COMPANY
SUBSIDIARIES; EQUITY INTERESTS. (a) The letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Sub (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE

owned by the Company, by another Significant Subsidiary of the Company or by
the Company and another Significant Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear
of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS").   (b)
Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries and except for the
ownership interests set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
person.   SECTION 3.03. CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (together with
the Company Common Stock, the "COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK"). At the close of

28, 2000 (as amended from time to time, the "COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT"),
between the Company and Fleet National Bank, as Rights Agent. Except as set
forth above, at the close of business on May 26, 2000, no shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding Company SARs (as defined in
Section 6.04) that were not granted in tandem with a related Company Stock
Option. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are, and all such
shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first

date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding contractual obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
The Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Company Rights Agreement, as amended to the date of this Agreement.

AUTHORITY; EXECUTION AND DELIVERY; ENFORCEABILITY. (a) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject to the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined below) with
respect to the Merger if required by Law, to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the
Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section
3.04(c)). The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and
this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation
(subject to the Company Stockholder Approval with respect to the Merger if
required by Law), enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\'
rights and by the effect of the principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).   (b)
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY BOARD"), at a meeting
duly called and held, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
(ii) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (iii) recommending that the holders of Company Common Stock

the Offer and (iv) recommending that the Company\'s stockholders approve this
Agreement. Such resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent

the other Transactions the provisions of Chapter 110C (assuming the
requirement that the terms of the Offer be furnished to shareholders is
satisfied), Chapter 110D and Chapter 110F of the BCL. To the Company\'s
knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction. The Company has been advised
by each of its directors and executive officers that, as of the date of this
Agreement, each such person intends to tender all shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such person pursuant to the Offer, except to the extent
of any restrictions created by Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.   (c) The
only vote of holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the approval
of this Agreement by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding Company
Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). The affirmative vote of
the holders of Company Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary
to consummate the Offer or any Transaction other than the Merger.   SECTION

result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of
any person under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any

matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order, injunction or
decree, domestic or foreign ("JUDGMENT"), or statute, law (including common
law), legislation, interpretation, ordinance, rule or regulation, domestic or
foreign ("LAW"), applicable to the Company or any Company    17   
16   Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually
and in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) No consent, approval,
license, permit, order or authorization ("CONSENT") of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Federal, state, local or foreign government
or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission
or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a

(the "PROXY STATEMENT"), (C) any information statement (the "INFORMATION

such reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act as may be required in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions, (iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the

immediately prior to the Effective Time.   SECTION 3.06. SEC DOCUMENTS;
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company with the
SEC since January 1, 1998 (the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS"). As of its respective
date, each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "SECURITIES ACT"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document, and
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company\'s Annual

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments). Except as set forth in the Filed Company SEC Documents (as
defined in Section 3.08), neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated
balance    19    18   sheet of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries or in the notes thereto, other than liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice
since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Filed
Company SEC Documents.   SECTION 3.07. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or

or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9, the Information
Statement and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.   SECTION 3.08. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "FILED COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS") or in
the Company Disclosure Letter, from the date of the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents to the date
of this Agreement, the Company has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course, and during such period there has not been:   (i) any
event, change, effect or development that, individually or in  the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse
Effect;   (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend
or  other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to

Subsidiary of any increase in compensation, except to the extent  required
under employment agreements in effect as of the date of the most  recent
audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC  Documents or,
with respect to employees (other than directors, officers or  key employees)
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior  practice and except
for Company Stock Options that are reflected as  outstanding in clause (iii)
of Section 3.03, (B) any granting by the  Company or any Company Subsidiary
to any such director, officer or employee  of any material increase in
severance or termination pay, except as was  required under any employment,
severance or termination policy, practice or  agreements in effect as of the

Company SEC Documents or (C) any entry by  the Company or any Company
Subsidiary into, or any amendment of, any  employment, severance or
termination agreement with any such director,  officer or employee, except
for such agreements or amendments with  employees (other than directors,
officers or key employees) that are  entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with prior  practice;   (v) any termination of
employment or departure of any officer,  material scientist or other key
employee of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary;   (vi) any change in
accounting methods, principles or practices by the  Company or any Company
Subsidiary materially affecting the consolidated  assets, liabilities or
results of operations of the Company, except insofar  as may have been
required by a change in GAAP; or   (vii) any material elections with respect
to Taxes (as defined in  Section 3.09) by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or settlement or  compromise by the    21    20   
Company or any Company Subsidiary of any material Tax liability or refund.  
SECTION 3.09. TAXES. (a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has
timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and
accurate, except to the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in any
filed Tax Returns, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed, have been
timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay, individually
and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The most recent financial
statements contained in the Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve (in accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes payable by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods and portions thereof through
the date of such financial statements (in addition to any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and tax
income). No deficiency with respect to any Taxes has been proposed, asserted
or assessed against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and no requests
for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending, except to the
extent any such deficiency or request for waiver, individually and in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) The Federal income Tax Returns of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary consolidated in such Returns have never been
examined by or settled with the United States Internal Revenue Service. All
material assessments for Taxes due with respect to such completed and settled
examinations or any concluded litigation have been fully paid.   (d) There
are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and
payable) on the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is bound by any agreement with respect to
Taxes other than agreements between or among the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and no other person.    22    21    (e) Note 14 to the
Company\'s consolidated financial statements included in the 1999 Form 10-K
has been prepared in accordance with GAAP.   (f) No claim has been made in
the past five years by any authority in a jurisdiction within which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is, or
may be, subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.   (g) Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying or intended
to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) in the
two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution that

transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)
in conjunction with the Merger.   (h) For purposes of this Agreement:

disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or in the Company Disclosure
Letter, from the date of the most recent audited financial statements
included in the Filed Company SEC Documents to the date of this Agreement,
there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material respect by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary of any collective bargaining agreement or
any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock,
retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization,
medical or other plan or arrangement providing benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, "COMPANY    23    22   BENEFIT PLANS"). Except as
disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or in the Company Disclosure
Letter, as of the date of this Agreement there are not any employment,
consulting, indemnification, severance or termination agreements or
arrangements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, nor does the Company or any Company Subsidiary have any general
severance plan or policy.   SECTION 3.11. ERISA COMPLIANCE; EXCESS
PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. (a) The Company Disclosure Letter contains a list and
brief description of all material "employee pension benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to herein as "COMPANY PENSION
PLANS"), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed to, by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or
former employees, officers or directors of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and
correct copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any
unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a description thereof), (ii) the most
recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required),
(iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan
for which such summary plan description is required and (iv) each trust
agreement and group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan, if
any.   (b) All Company Benefit Plans are in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Law (including, where applicable, the Code
and ERISA). All Company Pension Plans which are intended to be tax-qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code have been the subject of determination
letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company
Pension Plans are qualified and their related trusts are exempt from Federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and no such determination
letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation
been threatened. No such Company Pension Plan been amended since the date of
its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect
that would adversely affect its qualification, nor has any such Company
Pension Plan been amended since December 31, 1998 in any respect that would
materially increase its costs.    24    23    (c) No Company Pension
Plan is a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA
or is subject to the minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any actual or contingent liability under any defined benefit plan which it
(or any affiliate) previously maintained or contributed to (or was obligated
to maintain or contribute to). None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
any officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company
Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Company Pension
Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof,
has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility that could subject the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any material tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to
any material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA.   (d) With
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan,
(i) all such Company Benefit Plans are unfunded and no such Company Benefit
Plan is funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code), (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan that is a
"group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code), complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
Section 4980B(f) of the Code and (iii) each such Company Benefit Plan
(including any such Plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be
amended or terminated without material liability to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time, except
with respect to contributions, premiums or benefit claims (actual or
contingent) with respect to the period from the Effective Time to such
termination.   (e) Other than payments that may be made to the persons
listed in the Company Disclosure Letter (the "PRIMARY COMPANY EXECUTIVES"),
any amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting
of property) as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction by
any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates who
is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or
termination agreement, any other compensation arrangement or any Company
Benefit Plan currently in effect would not be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined    25    24   in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code). Set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter is (i) the estimated
maximum amount that could be paid to each Primary Company Executive as a
result of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions under all
employment, severance and termination agreements, other
compensation arrangements and Company Benefit Plans currently in effect and
(ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for
each Primary Company Executive calculated as of the date of this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.12. LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Filed
Company SEC Documents or in the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no suit,
action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and, as of the
date of this Agreement, the Company is not aware of any basis for any such
suit, action or proceeding) that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
other than any action, suit or proceeding filed or threatened after the date
of this Agreement that is based upon the same or substantially the same facts
that serve as the basis for any suit, action or proceeding disclosed in the
Filed Company SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Letter, nor is there
any Judgment outstanding against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.13. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. Except as disclosed
in the Filed Company SEC Documents or in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Laws, including those relating to occupational health and safety and the
environment, except for instances of noncompliance that, individually and in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Filed Company SEC
Documents or in the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past two
years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material respect with any applicable
Law. Except as set forth in the Filed Company SEC Documents or in the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance
in all material respects with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,
as amended (the "FDC ACT"), and applicable regulations promulgated
thereunder, and are in compliance in all material respects with all FDA   
26    25   regulations, including the FDA\'s Quality System Regulation,

Company Subsidiaries have maintained quality assurance/quality control
practices and procedures in compliance in all material respects with good
manufacturing practices within the meaning of the FDC Act and applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder. This Section 3.13 does not relate to
matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.09.  
SECTION 3.14. CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS. Except as disclosed in the Filed
SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no contracts
or agreements that are material to the business, assets, condition (financial
or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition
which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause
such a violation of or default under) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise, license or
any other contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.15. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right
to use, all patents, patent rights (including patent applications and
licenses), know-how, trade secrets, trademarks, trademark rights, trade

other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer programs
(collectively, "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS") which are material to the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as
a whole and the consummation of the Transactions (other than the transactions

Intellectual Property Rights. The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a

Company Subsidiaries: material patents, material patent rights (including
patent applications and licenses), material inventions that have been
identified as active patent matters but for which applications have not yet

infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any person with
regard to any Intellectual Property Right or (ii) assert that any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
("OWNED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS") are invalid or unenforceable. To the
knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the Filed Company
SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Letter, no person is infringing the
rights of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any
Owned Intellectual Property Right.   (b) The Company has timely paid, or
caused to be timely paid, all maintenance, renewal and other similar fees,
and has timely met any applicable working requirements with respect to all
Owned Intellectual Property Rights listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except
as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter. With respect to Intellectual
Property Rights other than Owned Intellectual Property Rights ("LICENSED
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS") that are listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken at a
whole, the Company is in compliance in all material respects with any
applicable license or similar agreement.   (c) All Owned Intellectual
Property Rights listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, are free and clear of any
Liens (other than Liens that are not material in amount or that would not
reasonably be expected to materially interfere with such Intellectual
Property Rights) and may be freely transferred, assigned, licensed or
sublicensed except as set forth in the Company Disclosure letter. The
Company\'s licenses with respect to all Licensed Intellectual Property
Rights that are listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole are free and clear of
any Liens (other than Liens that are not material in amount or that would not

expenses incurred and to be incurred by the Company in connection with
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (including the fees of
Chase Securities Inc. and the fees of the Company\'s legal counsel) are set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.   SECTION 3.17. OPINION OF

the consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger by the holders
of Company Common Stock is fair to such holders from a financial point of
view and a copy of the signed opinion has been provided to Parent.  
SECTION 3.18. LENS EXPRESS, INC. SALE. Following the closing of the sale
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Lens Express, Inc., the
Company and Strategic Optical Holdings, Inc. dated May 4, 2000 (the

Section 5.02(c),(x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y) participate in discussions

which shall be Chase Securities Inc. or another nationally recognized 
independent financial advisor), taking into account all the terms and 
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by

Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, take all

shall be necessary    42    41   to effectuate the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, payment
shall, at Parent\'s request, be withheld in respect of any Company Stock
Option until all necessary consents with respect to such Company Stock Option
are obtained.   (c) The Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the
Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Benefit Plan providing for
the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as
of the Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or Company SAR or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan shall
have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation.   (d) In this Agreement:   "COMPANY STOCK OPTION"
means any option to purchase Company Common  Stock granted under any Company
Stock Plan.   "COMPANY SAR" means any stock appreciation right linked to the
price  of Company Common Stock and granted under any Company Stock Plan.  
"COMPANY STOCK PLANS" means the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Outside 
Directors, the 1999 Outside Director Compensation Plan, the 1987 Stock 
Option Plan, the 1997 Stock Option Plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
and all agreements under which there are outstanding options to purchase 
Company Common Stock granted to employees, consultants or any other

6.04, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to maintain for a
period of one year after the Effective Time the Company Benefit Plans (other
than equity-based plans) in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) to
provide benefits (other than equity-based plans) to each current employee of
the Company and its subsidiaries that are not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to such employees than those benefits in effect for such
employees on the date of this Agreement.   (b) In addition to the agreement
set forth in Section 6.05(a), from and after the Control Date and from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to honor in    43    42   accordance with
their respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the
Company\'s employment, severance and termination agreements, plans and
policies disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, including any change in
control provisions contained therein.   (c) With respect to any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries (including any severance plan), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate and vesting, service with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent
or any of its subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.   SECTION 6.06. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Parent shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Company (from and after the
Control Date) and the Surviving Corporation (from and after the Effective
Time) to honor all the Company\'s obligations to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the
current and former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of acts or
omissions by any such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the maximum extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the
date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company
By-laws, the BCL, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company By-
laws, the BCL and such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective
Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such
acts or omissions. In the event a current or former director or officer of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is entitled to indemnification under
this Section 6.06(a), such director or officer shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Company (from and after the Control Date) or the
Surviving Corporation (from and after the Effective Time) for
reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by such director or officer in
pursuing such indemnification, including payment of such fees and expenses by
the Surviving Corporation or the Company, as applicable, in advance of the
final disposition of such action upon receipt of an undertaking by such
current or former director or officer to repay such payment if it shall be
adjudicated that such    44    43  current or former director or
officer was not entitled to such payment.   (b) From and after the Control
Date and for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that
Parent may either (i) substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers or (ii) maintain self insurance or similar
arrangements through a financially sound insurance affiliate of Parent, in
each case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective
Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual
premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200%
of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (such 200% amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to
Parent that the Maximum Premium is $400,000.   (c) The Company will
maintain, through the Effective Time, the Company\'s existing directors\' and
officers\' insurance in full force and effect without reduction of
coverage.   (d) The By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
the provisions that are set forth, as of the date of this Agreement, in
Article VIII of the By-Laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who at or at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers, employees or other agents of the Company (and
during such period the Articles of Organization of the Company shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would have the
effect of so amending, repealing or otherwise modifying such provisions of
the By-Laws).   (e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or    45    44   merger and the continuing or surviving entity does
not assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 6.06, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
assume, as a matter of law or otherwise, the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.06.   (f) Parent guarantees that if for any reason the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall not meet its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.06, it shall meet such obligations in
full when and as such obligations arise.   SECTION 6.07. FEES AND EXPENSES.
(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.   (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $32.5 million
if: (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) as a
result of the failure of the condition set forth in paragraph (d) of Exhibit
A; (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e);
(iii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i) or
8.01(d)(ii) as a result of a material breach of Section 5.02; (iv) after the
date of this Agreement, any person makes a Company Takeover Proposal, (A) the
Offer shall have remained open until the scheduled expiration date
immediately following the date such Company Takeover Proposal is made, (B)
the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied at such expiration date, (C)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iii)
(other than as a result of the failure of the condition set forth in
paragraph (d) of Exhibit A) and (D) within 12 months of such termination the
Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal; or (v) subject to
Section 6.07(c), this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c) as
a result of a wilful breach by the Company and within 12 months of such
termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal.
Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of
same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in
the case of clause (iv) or (v) above such payment shall be made on the   
46    45   date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if
earlier, consummation of such transactions).   (c) If the Company becomes
obligated to pay a fee under Section 6.07(b) as a result of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.01(c), Parent may elect not to receive the fee and may
instead pursue any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have
under Law with respect to the breach giving rise to such right of
termination. If Parent elects to receive the fee, and the Company pays the
fee as required by Section 6.07(b), the payment by the Company of such fee
shall be Parent\'s sole remedy with respect to such breach and Parent shall
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud) it may have against the Company with respect to such breach.  
SECTION 6.08. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law (including foreign regulations relating to
competition), court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.   SECTION 6.09. TRANSFER
TAXES. All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and
additions to any such Taxes) ("TRANSFER TAXES") incurred in connection with
the Transactions shall be paid by the party upon whom the primary burden for
payment is placed by the applicable law. Each party shall cooperate with the
other in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes and shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from such Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate
in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions.   SECTION 6.10. DIRECTORS. Promptly upon the first
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Sub for, any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Sub shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors on the Company Board as will give Sub, subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the
Company Board equal to at least that number of    47   
46   directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is the product
of (a) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to
the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the
percentage that (i) such number of shares of Company Common Stock so accepted
for payment and paid for by Sub plus the number of shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise owned by Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (ii)
the number of such shares outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time,
cause Sub\'s designees to be so elected; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event
that Sub\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until
the Effective Time the Company Board shall have at least three directors who
are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the
Company (the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS"); and PROVIDED FURTHER that, in such
event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below three
for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent Directors (or
Independent Director, if there shall be only one remaining) shall be entitled
to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent
Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three persons to
fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or affiliates of the
Company, Parent or Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall take all action requested by Parent necessary to effect
any such election, including mailing to its stockholders the Information
Statement containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall
make such mailing with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Sub
shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required
to be included in the Information Statement with respect to Sub\'s
designees). In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at
the option of Sub, either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain
the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to
enable Sub\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as
provided above.   SECTION 6.11. RIGHTS AGREEMENT; CONSEQUENCES IF RIGHTS
TRIGGERED. The Company Board shall take all action requested in writing by
Parent in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions. Except as approved in writing by Parent,
the Company Board shall not (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement, (ii)
redeem the Company Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make
any    48    47   determination under, the Company Rights Agreement,
in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub. If any Distribution Date,
Stock Acquisition Date or Common Stock Event occurs under the Company Rights
Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the
Offer Price as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve
the economic benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on
the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.   SECTION 6.12. STOCKHOLDER
LITIGATION. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company
and its directors relating to any Transaction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent
shall have the right to prevent the Company from entering into any such
settlement without Parent\'s consent if Parent agrees to indemnify the
Company and each director of the Company for the amount of its, his or her
liability, if any, arising from the underlying claim, net of any insurance
proceeds received by such person, that is in excess of the amount for which
such person would have been liable under such settlement.   SECTION 6.13.
TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS. No later than simultaneously with the
first acceptance for payment of, and payment by Sub for, at least two-thirds
of the Fully Diluted Shares (as defined in Exhibit A) pursuant to the Offer,
(a) the Company shall cause its subsidiary, Autonomous Technologies Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("AUTONOMOUS"), to transfer (x) certain of the
Intellectual Property Rights of Autonomous and its subsidiaries and (y)
certain licenses, approvals and registrations issued by, or filed with, the
FDA, and all other Governmental Entities performing similar functions,
and all rights therein, of Autonomous and its subsidiaries with respect to
any products of Autonomous and its subsidiaries to Alcon Universal Ltd., a
Swiss corporation ("AUL"), in exchange for a cash payment by AUL equal to the
fair market value of the transferred assets, and (b) the Company shall
transfer to AUL all of the outstanding shares of stock in its subsidiary,
Summit Technology Ireland B.V., a Netherlands corporation ("DUTCHCO"), in
exchange for a cash payment by AUL equal to the net book value of DutchCo).
If any consent required to transfer an asset pursuant to this Section 6.13
has not been obtained prior to the time at which such transfer would
otherwise occur, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in any lawful and
reasonable    49    48  arrangement proposed by Parent under which AUL
shall obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under such asset until
such consent has been obtained.    ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

subsidiaries taken as a whole, as a result of the Offer, the  Merger or any
other Transaction, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the  ability of

any shares of Company Common Stock, including the right to  vote the Company
Common Stock acquired by it on all matters properly  presented to the
stockholders of the Company or (iv) seeking to prohibit  Parent or any of its
subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any  material respect the
business or operations of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries;   (b)

Transaction, by any Governmental Entity that is reasonably likely to  result,
directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in  paragraph
(a) above;   (c) except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or
the  Company Disclosure Letter, since the date of the most recent audited 
financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents there  shall
have occurred any event, change, effect or development that,  individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected  to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;   (d) the Company Board or any committee thereof

recommended, or publicly  proposed to approve or recommend, any Company
Takeover Proposal;   (e) any representation and warranty of the Company in
this Agreement  that is qualified as to materiality shall not be true and
correct or any  such representation and warranty that is not so
qualified    61    3    shall not be true and correct in any material
respect, as of the date of  this Agreement and as of such time, except to the
extent such  representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier date
(in which  case on and as of such earlier date);   (f) the Company shall
have failed to perform in any material respect  any obligation or to comply
in any material respect with any agreement or  covenant of the Company to be

perform or comply cannot be or has not been  cured within five days after the
giving of written notice to the Company of  such breach; or   (g) this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its  terms;  which,
in the sole and good faith judgment of Sub or Parent, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition
(including any action or inaction by Parent or any of its affiliates), makes
it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment.  
The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Sub and Parent and,
subject to Section 1.01(a), may be asserted by Sub or Parent regardless
of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Sub
and Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their
sole discretion (subject to the terms of this Agreement). The failure by
Parent, Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.    62    EXHIBIT B

reason be adverse to the interests  of the corporation, and a vote of the
directors refusing permission to  make such examination and setting forth
that in the opinion of the  directors such reexamination would be adverse to

or in any way affected, solely for this reason, or solely  because the
director or officer is present at or participates in the  meeting of the
Board of Directors or committee thereof which  authorizes, approves or
ratifies the contract or transaction, or  solely because his/her or their
votes are counted for such purposes,  if:    68    7    (i) The

or transaction are disclosed or are  known to the Board of Directors or the

relationship or interest  and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are  known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the 
contract or transaction is specifically authorized,  approved or ratified in

shall not eliminate or  limit the liability of a director, (i) for any breach
of the  director\'s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, 
(ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve  intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under  Section 61 or 62 or
successor provisions of the Massachusetts Business  Corporation Law, or (iv)
for any transaction from which the director  derived an improper personal
benefit. This provision shall not  eliminate or limit the liability of a
director for any act or omission  occurring prior to March 18, 1987. No

the liability or  alleged liability of any director for or with respect to
any acts or  omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment
or  repeal.  NINE: Pursuant to a written consent of the sole stockholder of
