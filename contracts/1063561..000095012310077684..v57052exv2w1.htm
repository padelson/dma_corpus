 1.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Stock_  

  

 2.1 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock: 

    

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $.01 per share. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned Directly or Indirectly by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub_. Each outstanding or issued share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub, or by any wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive (other than with respect to Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law. 

   

 (d) _Treatment of Company Stock Awards_. 

   

 (i) (x) Except as set forth in clause (y) below, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option under any Company Equity Incentive Plan, including any and all Company Stock Options under the Prospect Medical Holdings Inc., 2008 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, shall be canceled and (y) the Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all agreements or consents necessary for each Company Stock Option under the 1998 Plan to be canceled at the Effective Time. In consideration of each such cancellation set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the previous sentence, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option that are then vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any determination by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the vesting of all or a portion of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option) and (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, less any applicable withholding Taxes. If the exercise price per share of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, then such Company Stock Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect thereof, and if any shares of Company Common Stock subject to such a Company Stock Option are unvested and unexercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, then such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time to the extent shares of 

   ##### 

  

  

Company Common Stock are unvested and unexercisable without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. The amount payable pursuant to this Section
2.1(d)(i) is referred to herein as the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ". 

    

 (ii) At the Effective Time, restrictions on each outstanding share of restricted stock issued under any Company Equity Incentive Plans (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ "), will lapse as of such Effective Time and such Company Restricted Shares shall be treated in the same manner as other shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c). 

   

 (iii) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Equity Incentive Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the Company Common Stock or the capital stock of any Subsidiary shall be cancelled. The Company shall ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other Equity Interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights), except as set forth herein. The Company Board (or if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Equity Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required, to effect the foregoing. 

   

 (e)  _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all amendments and modifications necessary for each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time and for each Company Warrant to automatically convert at the Effective Time into the right to receive cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Warrant is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Warrant shall be canceled at the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) is referred to herein as the " _Warrant Merger Consideration_." 

  

 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. 

    

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Parent shall appoint, subject to the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), a bank or trust company to act as Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration and the Warrant Merger Consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration"_ ). Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on customary terms, which terms shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited (including by causing the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to deposit) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including shares of 

   ##### 

  

  

Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Stock Options and the
Company Warrants at or prior to the Effective Time), holders of Company Stock
Options and holders of Company Warrants, for payment in accordance with
Section 2.1, the aggregate Merger Consideration (such total deposited cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in
accordance with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on
the Payment Fund shall be paid to Parent. 

    

 (b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the common stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. On and after the Effective Time, a holder of a Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have only the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration. On or after the Effective Time, a holder of a Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall only have the right to receive the Warrant Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Payment Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as possible after the Effective Time (but in any event within five (5) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, 

   ##### 

  

  

payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. 

    

 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation (including any interest received with respect thereto), and any holders of  shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares, Company Warrants or Company Stock Options prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and only as general creditors thereof for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration or the Warrant Merger Consideration, as applicable. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Payment Fund shall not be invested in any manner that would preclude, limit or delay the Paying Agent from timely making all payments contemplated by this Article II; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that, if invested, such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations guaranteed by, the United States of America. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Paying Agent or Parent with regard to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, as applicable, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such holders of Dissenting Shares shall instead be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to Company stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company stockholders under the DGCL; _provided_ that Parent shall not be permitted to take any action in connection therewith that would require the Company to incur material costs or to pay any amount prior to the Closing or to take or refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company if the Closing does not occur. The Company shall not, prior to the Effective Time, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily (x) make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or any offer to settle or (y) settle any such demands. 

   

 2.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Warrants, in the aggregate, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration.

so disclosed). The term "Filed SEC Documents" shall not be deemed to include
(x) the exhibits and schedules thereto or any documents incorporated by

 (b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified, licensed or to be in good standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its

 (c) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 6.1(c), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval;  _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting with the consent of Parent, (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable period of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient  shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to such holders as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date or, in the event the Company is continuing to engage in activities described in Section 6.4(a)(ii) with respect to a Takeover Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Cut-off Date. Subject to Section 6.4, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and the Company Board shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval.

 6.4 _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_. 

    

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 p.m. (New York City time) on the fortieth (40th) day following the date of this 

   ##### 

  

  

Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall have the right to: (i) initiate,
solicit and encourage Takeover Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers
or other efforts or attempts that are reasonably expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal), including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and,

non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
that is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (ii) enter into, engage in,
and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Takeover Proposals
or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations. 

    

 (b) Except as permitted by this Section 6.4, the Company shall and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, on the No-Shop Period Start Date, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all activities, solicitations, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and (ii) request any such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this Section 6.4, from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, or knowingly facilitate, cooperate with or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or data) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise knowingly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other party information or data in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Takeover Proposal, (C) enter into any letter of intent, agreement, contract or agreement in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal or (D) enter into any agreement, contract or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder or fail to consummate the Transaction. No later than two (2) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each party (including any Excluded Party) that submitted a Takeover Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and shall promptly provide to Parent a written summary of the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal (including the identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal). The parties agree that, notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company under this Section 6.4(b) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 6.4(a)(ii) with respect to a Takeover Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date until 12:01 p.m. (New York City time) on the 20th day following the No-Shop Period Start Date (the " _Cut-_  

   ##### 

  

  

 _off Date_ ") including with respect to any amended or revised proposal
submitted by such Excluded Party on or before the Cut-off Date. 

    

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a) or 6.4(b), if at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its Representatives is in receipt of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal from any Person, which Takeover Proposal is made or renewed on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and has not been subsequently withdrawn, (ii) the Company has not breached this Section 6.4, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, (a) after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (b) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take the action set forth in clauses (x) or (y) below would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons that has made such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) any nonpublic information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) (i) a copy of any Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and the identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made in writing. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not grant any amendment, release or waiver under any standstill agreement without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 (d) Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal (whether made before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date) on a current basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) and shall notify Parent of the status of such Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.4. 

   

 (e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.4(e) or Section 6.4(f), the Company Board shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a 

   ##### 

  

   

tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of
the Company a Takeover Proposal or (E) enter into any contract or agreement
in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its
obligations hereunder or fail to consummate the Transaction (actions
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
or agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than
(x) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (y) an agreement to reimburse
the reasonable out of pocket expenses of any Person (not to exceed
$1,000,000, in the aggregate for all such Persons) that submits a Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board determines pursuant to this Section 6.4
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal or
that submits a Takeover Proposal and thereafter, in response to such Takeover
Proposal, Parent revises any of the material terms of this Agreement,
_provided_ that such expense reimbursement is only payable to such Person in
the event the Company does not enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal due to the fact that the Company Board
determines that pursuant to this Section 6.4 the Takeover Proposal submitted
by such Person no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal or Parent revised
the terms of this Agreement and/or the Financing Commitment such that it
caused such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iii) take any action
pursuant to Section 8.1(e). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not
after, if the Company is in receipt of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after (in each case) giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent
(including pursuant to clause (iii) below) and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith, that the
failure to take the action set forth in clauses (x) or (y) below would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company Board may (x) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement and enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Termination Fee and the Parents Expenses and otherwise complies with the
provisions of Section 8.1(e) and Section 8.3; and  _provided_ _further_ that
the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause
(x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless
(A) the Company shall not have breached this Section 6.4 and (B): 

   

 (i) such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) the Company has given Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal)) and has contemporaneously provided a copy of each of the relevant proposed transaction agreements to be entered into by the Company with the party making such Superior Proposal; 

   

 (iii) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement and/or the Financing Commitment such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and 

   

 (iv) in the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Parent a new written notice (which notice shall specify the change in the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and contemporaneously provide a copy of each of the relevant proposed transaction agreements to be entered into by the Company with the party making such Superior Proposal, the notice period shall have recommenced and the Company shall be required to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.4 with respect to such new written notice; 

   

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) the Company receives any Takeover
Proposal pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company would be entitled
to receive 110% or more of the Per Share Merger Consideration, and (B) the
Board determines that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
then the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to the immediately
preceding Section 6.4(e)(y)(B)(iii) and Section 6.4(e)(y)(B)(iv) shall not
apply; provided, further, however, for purposes of determining whether or not
a Takeover Proposal shall have satisfied the provisions of clause (A) above,
the Board must either compare (1) the initial Takeover Proposal to the Per
Share Merger Consideration reflected in this Agreement, or (2) the then
current Takeover Proposal to the then current Per Share Merger Consideration
proposed by the Parent, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 6.4(e) shall prevent or preclude Parent from proposing to revise
the terms of this Agreement or taking any actions relating thereto. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such action, (x) the Company Board has given Parent at least two (2) Business Days 

   ##### 

  

   

prior written notice of its intention to take such action, (y) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement or the
Financing Commitment in such a manner that would obviate the need for taking
such action and (z) following the end of such notice period, the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement and
the Financing Commitment proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (g) Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board shall not recommend that the Company stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with a tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal) unless such tender or exchange offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and the applicable requirements of this Section 6.4 shall have been satisfied. 

   

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to more than 20% of the Companys consolidated assets or to which more than 20% of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning more than 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E) combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is more than 20%; in each case, other than the Transaction. 

   

 (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, after taking into account all legal, regulatory, timing, breakup fee and expense reimbursement provisions of the proposal, the Person making the proposal and the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to the terms herein), and that if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise), _provided_ that for purposes 

   ##### 

  

   

of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%." 

   

 (j) As used in this Agreement, " _Excluded Party_ " shall mean any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (so long as such Person and the other members of such group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement), from whom the Company has received a Takeover Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that, on or before the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal has not been rejected or withdrawn as of the No-Shop Period Start Date. Further, on the No-Shop Period Start Date, in addition to the information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 6.4, the Company shall identify for Parent which Persons submitting Takeover Proposals have been determined by the Company Board to be an Excluded Party and a summary of the reasons for such determination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement upon the earlier of (x) twenty (20) days after the No-Shop Period Start Date and (y) immediately at such time as such Takeover Proposal made by such party is withdrawn, terminated, expires or no longer constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a material change in or adjustment of a Takeover Proposal shall not be considered a withdrawal or termination for the purposes of this Section 6.4. 

   

 (k) For purposes of this Section 6.4, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Board may act through the Special Committee, if the Special Committee is still in existence. 

  

 6.5 _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_. 

    

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors and administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties"_ ) is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or 

   ##### 

  

   

thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising at or before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless and,
from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, reasonable
and documented expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding, inquiry
or investigation, and, in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation (whether asserted or
arising at or before or after the Effective Time), (A) the Company and, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall promptly pay
the reasonable and documented expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party if required by
Law to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified therefor, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain
one counsel satisfactory to them, and the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within twenty (20)
days after statements therefor are received, and (C) the Company and, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any
such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and _provided_ _further_ that the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.5,
upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; _provided_ that
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and
the Surviving Corporation and Parent except to the extent, if any, such
failure to promptly notify materially prejudices such party. 

   

 (b) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each Indemnified Party provided for in Section 6.5(a) above or in the respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof (including through any agreement or arrangement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand) shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time and, 

   ##### 

  

   

at the Effective Time, shall become the joint and several obligations of the
Surviving Corporation and any applicable Company Subsidiary;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitations on personal liability in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_
") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Claim. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary also agree to jointly and
severally indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any
written indemnification agreements between the Company and/or one or more
Company Subsidiaries and such officers and directors as listed in Section
6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Parent and Surviving Corporation shall, at no cost to the beneficiaries thereunder, cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 200% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium not in excess of the Base Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , if either the Company or the Surviving Corporation, in each case, in its sole discretion elects, by giving written notice to the other party at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall purchase a directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Companys existing directors and officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be comparable to such existing coverage), _provided_ that the premium for such "tail" or "runoff" coverage shall not exceed an amount equal to the Base Premium; _provided_ that if the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company cannot be maintained for the Base Premium and such "tail" or "runoff" coverage can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the most advantageous "tail" or "runoff" coverage obtainable for an annual premium not in excess of the Base Premium. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as 

   ##### 

  

   

to adversely affect any indemnified party to whom this Section 6.5 applies
without the consent of each such affected indemnified party. This Section 6.5
is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party
beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
shall be binding on all successors of the Surviving Corporation. Each of
the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.5.

Parent by wire transfer of same day funds within two (2) Business Days after

payments set forth in this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street

Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. 

  

 9.7 _Assignment; Benefit_.

 9.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. 

  

 9.9 _Choice of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts, (iii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in such courts and (iv) agrees not to plead or claim in such

process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof
of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting
evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (x) or (y) above shall
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing the
parties agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in
the State of Delaware, each of Parent and Merger Sub does hereby appoint The
Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street,
Wilmington, DE 19081 as such agent. 

  

 9.10 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.3, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such expenses.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party.

At the request of any party, the parties will confirm facsimile or other electronic transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

 (a) Without limiting the rights of the Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of them has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages of the Parent or its Affiliates, any of the Company Parties (other than the Company to the extent provided in this Agreement), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against any Company Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise.

the Company, any of the Parent Parties (other than Parent and Merger Sub to
the extent provided in this Agreement), through either Parent or otherwise,
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of either Parent or any other Parent Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise.
