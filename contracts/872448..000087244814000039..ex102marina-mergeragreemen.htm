Common Stock for which the holder has exercised its conversion rights prior to
the Effective Time ("Convertible Debt"), each holder of any such Convertible
Debt shall be entitled to receive from Parent, in consideration of the
termination of the outstanding and unpaid amount of Indebtedness underlying
such Convertible Debt and in settlement therefore and in exchange for a

or in connection with the conversion and holding of the Convertible Debt,
subject to and in accordance with Section 4.4 of this Agreement, an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to the sum of (1) the product of (A) the total

of NMI Common Stock underlying such Convertible Debt. The amount of cash each
holder of Convertible Debt is entitled to receive for shares of NMI Common
Stock into which the Convertible Debt has been converted at or prior to

aggregating cash amounts payable for all shares of NMI Common Stock in which
the Convertible Debt has been converted by such holder. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of the Merger, and this
Agreement, the parties intend, to the extent that payment of any exercise or
conversion price is required in connection with the conversion of any
Convertible Debt into shares of NMI Common Stock, that the portion of such
Convertible Debt that may be so converted, be characterized and treated as a
Warrant to purchase NMI Common Stock and that the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and Earnout Payments, if any, payable in respect of such
Convertible Debt be determined in accordance with, and subject to, Section
1.7(i)(iii).

(k) Retention RSUs. Each Retention RSU outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent under the NMI Stock Plan and
converted into restricted stock units covering Parent Common Stock at the
Parent Share Conversion Rate, without any further action required. Each
assumed Retention RSU shall be subject to the same terms, including vesting
arrangements, that were applicable to such Retention RSUs immediately prior to
or at the Effective Time, and no vesting acceleration of the Retention RSUs
shall occur solely by reason of the Merger. Such Retention RSU shall cover
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with
no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of
(i) the number of shares of NMI Common Stock that were issuable upon
settlement of such Retention RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the (ii) Parent Share Conversion Rate. The assumption and
conversion of Retention RSUs by Parent will satisfy the requirements of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Retention RSU shall be entitled to participate in, receive proceeds from, or otherwise have any entitlement to, any Earnout
Payments or to receive any other payments or consideration in respect of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. Within sixty (60) calendar

Commission a registration statement on Form S-8 that will register the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to the Retention RSUs that are assumed by
Parent pursuant to this Section 1.7(k) to the extent permitted by Federal
securities laws and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses delivered
with respect to such shares) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

(l) Unvested Options. Each Unvested Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, without any further action required by any holder
thereof, be cancelled prior to the Effective Time in accordance with, and as
expressly permitted by, the NMI Stock Plan, and the holder thereof shall not
be entitled to receive any consideration therefor under this Agreement or
otherwise, whether from NMI, Parent or any other Person.

(m) Vested Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Option (including any
NMI Stock Options that by their terms automatically vest by virtue of the
Merger) outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be immediately canceled and, as consideration for such cancellation, the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (without interest), subject to and
in accordance with Section 4.4 and this Agreement, with respect to each share
of NMI Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable upon exercise of
such Vested Option an amount of cash equal to the sum of (1) the sum of (A)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Common Aggregate Consideration over the
per share exercise price with respect to such Vested Option (the excess
amount, if any, determined pursuant to this clause (1)(A) for each Vested
Option being referred to as the "Per Share Vested Option Net Aggregate
Consideration"), minus (B) the Per Share Vested Option Escrow Amount, minus
(C) the Per Share Vested Option Representative Expense Amount, plus (2) a
right to receive upon release from escrow the product of (A) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Common Aggregate Consideration over the per share
exercise price with respect to such Vested Option, multiplied by (B) the
Escrow Contribution Percentage (the product determined pursuant to this clause
(2) for each Vested Option being referred to as the "Per Share Vested Option
Escrow Amount"), plus (3) a right to receive upon release from escrow the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Common Aggregate
Consideration over the per share exercise price with respect to such Vested
Option, multiplied by (B) the Representative Expense Percentage (the product
determined pursuant to this clause (3) for each Vested Option being referred
to as the "Per Share Vested Option Representative Expense Amount"), plus (4)
the Per Share Earnout Payments, if any, payable in respect of each share of
NMI Common Stock underlying the Vested Option. The amount of cash each holder
of Vested Options exercisable for shares of NMI Common Stock is entitled to
receive for the Vested Options exercisable for shares of NMI Common Stock held
by such holder shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts payable for all Vested Options exercisable for shares
of NMI Common Stock held by such holder.

(n) NMI Preferred Stock. In the event the Aggregate Merger Consideration
(exclusive of any adjustment required under Section 1.15(e)) is less than the
aggregate of the Original Series A Issue Price, Original Series B Issue Price,

all shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and

Warrant to the extent exercised by the holder thereof on or prior to the Closing) and the holders of which do not
elect in writing to convert their NMI Preferred Stock into shares of NMI
Common Stock on or prior to the Closing, then, in such event, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Aggregate Merger Consideration
(exclusive of any adjustment required under Section 1.15(e)) shall be
allocated ratably among the shares of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred,
Series C Preferred, and Series D Preferred in proportion to the Original

this Agreement, be deemed to equal the amount allocated hereby in accordance
with this Section 1.7(n) to each share of Series A Preferred, Series B
Preferred, Series C Preferred and Series D Preferred, respectively. Upon
receipt of the consideration contemplated by the foregoing sentence, the
holders of Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred, Series C Preferred and
Series D Preferred (including shares of NMI Preferred Stock underlying any
Warrant to the extent exercised by the holder thereof on or prior to the
Closing) shall not be entitled to receive, or to participate in, any further

Escrow Agreement, and (b) deemed to have received the requisite Series A

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, NMI Capital
Stock which is held by stockholders who have the right to dissent with respect
to the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Code (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be cancelled and extinguished and converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable merger consideration as
set forth in Section 1.7 and the holders of the Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Code ("Dissenting Share
Payment"), unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right under the Delaware Code. If any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
cancelled and extinguished and converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive, as of the Effective Time, the applicable merger consideration as
set forth in Section 1.7 without any interest thereon.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Dissenting
Share Payment in excess of the amount otherwise expressly payable to holders
of Dissenting Shares pursuant to this Agreement made by Parent shall be deemed
a "Loss" subject to the indemnification provisions of ARTICLE IV.

1.9 Rights Not Transferable. The rights of each Rights Holder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to each such Rights
Holder and shall not be transferable for any reason otherwise than by

to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate
series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause any amounts so deducted or withheld to be timely paid
over to the appropriate authorities; provided that the Surviving Corporation
is provided with all necessary documentation to support such payments. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

1.12 Repayment of Closing Debt. NMI shall provide Parent with a statement of
Closing Debt (the "Statement of Closing Debt") showing details of all unpaid
Closing Debt owing, or expected to be owed, by NMI not later than 12:00 p.m.

Date in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Simultaneously with, or

for the payments to each Rights Holder upon surrender of certificates
representing shares of NMI Capital Stock (and Warrants and Convertible Debt
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
NMI Capital Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive a
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration) (the "Certificates") or any
other payments required by Section 1.7. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to each holder of Vested Options the portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(m) less
any applicable Tax withholding. (b) Exchange Procedure. Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time,
Buyer or the Paying Agent shall mail or deliver to each holder of record of
Certificates: (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit K (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to Parent, and shall include a full release of all claims (except
claims arising under this Agreement) in favor of Buyer and, effective upon the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation)(the "Letter of Transmittal"), and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent, the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment on the
terms and subject to the conditions otherwise set forth herein, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Parent may effect any
payment required under this Agreement through the Paying Agent or such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of NMI Capital Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of NMI, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.14, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of NMI
Capital Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 1.7. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of NMI Capital Stock. The portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Section 1.14 upon conversion of any shares of NMI Capital Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of NMI Capital Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of NMI Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of NMI Capital Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 1.14.

(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, NMI, or Paying Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the payment
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), then any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 1.15 Working Capital Adjustment

(a) The Aggregate Merger Consideration, as contemplated by Section 1.6, will
be adjusted upward or downward as provided by this Section 1.15. Schedule
1.15(a) sets forth an example calculation of Working Capital as of March 31,
2014 including the components thereof, assuming the Closing occurred on such
date and assuming the unaudited consolidated financial statements of NMI as of
such date delivered to Buyer before the Execution Date have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and are accurate and complete in all respects. At least
three Business Days prior to the Closing, NMI will deliver to Buyer (i) a
certificate, signed by each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of NMI (the "Working Capital Certificate"), setting forth a
good faith estimate of the Working Capital, including the components thereof,
as of immediately prior to the Closing, each calculated on a basis consistent
with GAAP (as expressly modified and adjusted by this Agreement as described
in Schedule 1.15(a)) and Schedule 1.15(a) (the "Estimated Working Capital"),
and (ii) the work papers used to prepare such balance sheet and estimate.

(b) Any amount by which the Estimated Working Capital:

| 
---|--- 

▪

|

exceeds $1,250,000 (such positive difference being referred to as the "Working
Capital Excess") will increase the Aggregate Merger Consideration as set forth
in Section 1.6(a) on a dollar-for-dollar basis, or 

| 
---|--- 

▪

|

is less than $750,000 (such positive difference being referred to as the
"Working Capital Shortfall") will decrease the Aggregate Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 1.6(a) on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 

Subject to Section 1.15(e), if the Estimated Working Capital falls within the
range of $750,000 and $1,250,000 (the "Working Capital Collar"), then no
adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be made.

(c) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of
NMI as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and
(ii) a statement setting forth the amount of, and the calculation of, NMI's
Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing, including the
components thereof, as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet and in
accordance with the sample calculation set forth in Schedule 1.15(a) (the
"Closing Date Working Capital"). The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP (as expressly modified and adjusted by this Agreement as
described in Schedule 1.15(a)) and Schedule 1.15(a) and will fairly present
the financial position of NMI as of the Closing Date, subject to the
modifications and adjustments required by this Agreement. Immediately
following the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the statement of the
Closing Date Working Capital, Buyer will provide the Representative and its
professional advisors reasonable access to the books and records and employees
of the Surviving Corporation as may be reasonably required by the
Representative to determine the accuracy of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
statement of Closing Date Working Capital and will cause the employees of the
Surviving Corporation and Buyer to reasonably cooperate with the
Representative and its professional advisors as may be reasonably required in
connection with their determination of the accuracy of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the statement of Closing Date Working Capital. If Buyer fails to
deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Date Working Capital within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
there shall be no adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 1.15.

(d) The Representative will notify Buyer in writing of any objections to the
Closing Date Working Capital or Closing Balance Sheet within twenty (20)
Business Days after the Representative receives the Closing Date Working
Capital and the Closing Balance Sheet; provided that the only basis on which
the Representative shall be permitted to object is that either the Closing
Date Working Capital or Closing Balance Sheet was not prepared in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, GAAP, or contains a mathematical error or
errors. If the Representative does not notify Buyer of any such objections by
the end of such twenty (20) Business Day period or specifies objections other
than those expressly permitted by the immediately prior sentence, then the
Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Balance Sheet will each be
considered final at the end of such twenty (20) Business Day period. If the
Representative does notify Buyer of any such objections by the end of such
twenty (20) Business Day period and the Representative and Buyer are unable to
resolve their differences within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, then the
remaining disputed items and the value attributable to them by each of the
Representative and Buyer will be submitted promptly to the Neutral Accounting
Firm for resolution, and the Neutral Accounting Firm will be instructed to
determine the final Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Balance Sheet and
deliver such findings to the Representative and Buyer within the time period
set forth in this Section 1.15(d). The Neutral Accounting Firm will consider
only those items and amounts in the Representative's and Buyer's respective
calculations of the Closing Date Working Capital that are identified as being
items and amounts with respect to which the Representative and Buyer have been
unable to agree and all other items included within the Closing Date Working
Capital or Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed final, conclusive and binding
on the parties (and not subject to further review in any forum). In resolving
any disputed item (and only such disputed items), the Neutral Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The Neutral Accounting Firm's determination of the
Closing Date Working Capital will be based solely on written materials
submitted by the Representative and Buyer (i.e., not an independent or de novo
review) and on the definition of Working Capital included herein. The Neutral
Accounting Firm shall provide its determination within twenty (20) Business
Days from the date the parties have submitted all of their supporting
documents. The decision of the Neutral Accounting Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto (and not subject to further
review in any forum). Neither Buyer nor Representative will have any right to,
and will not, institute any action challenging such determination or any of
the matters that are the subject of this Section 1.15, except that the
foregoing will not preclude an action to enforce such determination. If the
Neutral Accounting Firm's determination of Closing Date Working Capital is
closer to the value initially asserted by Buyer to the Neutral Accounting
Firm, then the Representative will pay the costs and expenses of the Neutral
Accounting Firm. If the Neutral Accounting Firm's determination of Closing
Date Working Capital is closer to the value initially asserted by the
Representative to the Neutral Accounting Firm, then Buyer will pay the costs
and expenses of the Neutral Accounting Firm. Each of Buyer and the
Representative will cooperate with and assist the Neutral Accounting Firm to
determine the final Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Balance Sheet,
including by making available and granting reasonable access to records and
employees.

(e) Within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the Closing
Date Working Capital in accordance with this Section 1.15: (i) if the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital are
both within the Working Capital Collar, then no adjustment to the Aggregate
Merger Consideration shall be made;

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital is within the Working Capital Collar and
the Closing Date Working Capital is greater than $1,250,000, then Buyer shall
pay to each Rights Holder that has complied with the exchange requirements set
forth in Section 1.14 an amount equal to such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share
of (1) the Closing Date Working Capital minus (2) $1,250,000 in accordance
with the payment instructions set forth on the Spreadsheet;

(iii) if the Estimated Working Capital is within the Working Capital Collar
and the Closing Date Working Capital is less than $750,000, then Buyer shall
be entitled to recover an amount equal to (1) $750,000 minus (2) the Closing
Date Working Capital from the Escrow Amount (without any amount subject to, or
counted toward, the Threshold Amount), and the Escrow Agent shall distribute
such amount to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

(iv) if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than $1,250,000 and the
Closing Date Working Capital is within the Working Capital Collar, then Buyer
shall be entitled to recover an amount equal to (1) the Estimated Working

subject to, or counted toward, the Threshold Amount), and the Escrow Agent
shall distribute such amount to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement;

(v) if the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital are
both greater than $1,250,000 and the Closing Date Working Capital is less than
the Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall be entitled to recover an
amount equal to (1) the Estimated Working Capital minus (2) the Closing Date
Working Capital from the Escrow Amount (without any amount subject to, or
counted toward, the Threshold Amount), and the Escrow Agent shall distribute
such amount to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

(vi) if the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital are
both greater than $1,250,000 and the Closing Date Working Capital is greater
than the Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to each Rights Holder
that has complied with the exchange requirements set forth in Section 1.14 an
amount equal to such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share of (1) the Closing Date
Working Capital minus (2) the Estimated Working Capital in accordance with the
payment instructions set forth on the Spreadsheet;

(vii) if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than $1,250,000 and the
Closing Date Working Capital is less than $750,000, then Buyer shall be
entitled to recover an amount equal to (1) the Estimated Working Capital,
minus (2) the Closing Date Working Capital, minus (3) $500,000 from the Escrow
Amount (without any amount subject to, or counted toward, the Threshold
Amount), and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount to Buyer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

(viii) if the Estimated Working Capital is less than $750,000 and the Closing
Date Working Capital is within the Working Capital Collar, then Buyer shall
pay to each Rights Holder that has complied with the exchange requirements set
forth in Section 1.14 an amount equal to such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share
of (1) $750,000 minus (2) the Estimated Working Capital in accordance with the
payment instructions set forth on the Spreadsheet; (ix) if the Estimated Working Capital is less than $750,000 and the Closing
Date Working Capital is greater than $1,250,000, then Buyer shall pay to each
Rights Holder that has complied with the exchange requirements set forth in
Section 1.14 an amount equal to such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share of (1) the
Closing Date Working Capital, minus (2) the Estimated Working Capital, minus
(3) $500,000 in accordance with the payment instructions set forth on the
Spreadsheet;

(x) if the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital are
both less than $750,000 and the Closing Date Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall be entitled to recover an amount
equal to (1) the Estimated Working Capital minus (2) the Closing Date Working
Capital from the Escrow Amount (without any amount subject to, or counted
toward, the Threshold Amount), and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such
amount to Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; and

(xi) if the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital are
both less than $750,000 and the Closing Date Working Capital is greater than
the Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to each Rights Holder that
has complied with the exchange requirements set forth in Section 1.14 an
amount equal to such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share of (1) the Closing Date
Working Capital minus (2) the Estimated Working Capital in accordance with the
payment instructions set forth on the Spreadsheet.

respect to the First Earnout Period, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid

Holder entitled to participate in the Earnout Payments who has surrendered

commercially reasonable in the exercise of its business judgment, and, subject
to the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates have no obligation, express,
implied or otherwise, to operate, fund or manage the Surviving Corporation or
any of the NMI business in order to achieve any Earnout Payments (and no
statements made, or any discussions undertaken, at any time prior to the Closing Date, with any Persons affiliated with NMI or any of
its Affiliates, regarding future product roadmaps, technology development,
resource allocations, reporting lines or employee responsibilities, by any
Person, whether employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates or engaged as an
advisor or representative of Parent or any of its Affiliates, shall be binding
in any respect, or limit, restrict or otherwise affect the terms or intent of
this Section 1.16(c)); provided, however, that Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, (A) act at all times
with respect to the Surviving Corporation and its business in good faith, (B)
not take any intentional action in bad faith that could reasonably be expected

parties further acknowledge and agree that (1) the amounts of the Earnout
Payments are speculative and subject to numerous factors outside the control
of Parent and its Affiliates and each Rights Holder acknowledges and confirms,
by his, her or its delivery of securities or a Letter of Transmittal to
Parent, or its agent, under this Agreement, that it has not relied on, and has
not been induced to enter into this Agreement on the basis of, any
representation, statement or other communication, whether written or oral, by
Parent or any of its Affiliates, NMI or any representatives of either,
including any investment banking professionals engaged by Parent or NMI, that
it has any entitlement to, or assurance of, receiving all or any portion of

will receive any Earnout Payment and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
has not promised or projected any Earnout Payments.

Corporation) to, keep books and records sufficient to calculate any Earnout
Payments.

(iii) All calculations with respect to IoT Revenue and Broadcast Revenue shall

Period and a calculation of the Earnout Payment, if any, owing for such period
(each such statement, an "Earnout Statement") and provide Representative with
(1) reasonable access to relevant books, records, documents, schedules and
workpapers of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
extent reasonably necessary to enable the Representative to verify the
accuracy of the Earnout Statement, and (2) reasonable access to the employees
and representatives of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to respond to relevant questions from the Representative.

(the "First Earnout Period Pre-Closing Revenue Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail (a) IoT Revenue for the period from July 1, 2014 through the

any) as a result of the dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the
immediately following sentence (the "First Earnout Period Pre-Closing IoT
Revenue"), and (b) Broadcast Revenue for the period from July 1, 2014 through
the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with GAAP and subject to adjustment

twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of the Earnout Statement (failure to
deliver a notice of disagreement with such twenty (20) Business Day period
shall constitute final acceptance by all Rights Holders and the Representative
of Parent's determination and calculation of the Earnout Payment and Earnout
Statement), which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in
reasonable detail. During the twenty (20) calendar day period following any
notice of disagreement delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent
and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith in order to attempt to
resolve any such disagreement. If Parent and the Representative are unable to
resolve such disagreement within such twenty (20) calendar day negotiation
period, at the election of either Parent or the Representative, they shall
each submit their respective proposed Earnout Payment amount to the Neutral
Accounting Firm, which shall, prior to undertaking its review, execute a non-
disclosure agreement acceptable to Parent, and Parent shall provide the
Neutral Accounting Firm, which shall be jointly retained by the Representative
and Parent, with reasonable access to relevant books, records, documents,
schedules and workpapers of Parent to the extent reasonably necessary to
enable the Neutral Accounting Firm to verify Parent's determination of the
Earnout Payment amount for the Earnout Period covered by such Earnout
Statement; provided that access shall be provided at reasonable times upon
reasonable prior notice to Parent and under reasonable circumstances and shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business operations of Parent. If the
Representative fails to deliver such a notice of disagreement in such twenty
(20) Business Day period, the Representative on behalf of all Rights Holders
shall have irrevocably and unconditionally waived its right to contest, and
shall be deemed to have agreed to, the Earnout Statement at issue and the
Earnout Payment amount shown thereon.

(ii) The Neutral Accounting Firm will only consider those specific issues and
matters as to which Parent and the Representative have disagreed, this
Agreement and the books, records, documents, schedules and workpapers that
each of Parent and the Representative may submit to the Neutral Accounting
Firm, which may include all of such party's calculations with respect to the
subject matter of the disagreement and all of its information, arguments and
support for its position. The Neutral Accounting Firm shall not consider, or
be entitled to reference or otherwise include in its review or deliberations,
any materials other than those referred to in the preceding sentence. Parent
and the Representative shall direct the Neutral Accounting Firm to deliver to
Parent and the Representative, as promptly as practicable and in any event
within twenty (20) Business Days after its appointment, a written report
setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement. The determination of
the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Parent
and the Representative. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Neutral Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees, expenses and
costs of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party which submits
the proposed Earnout Payment amount to the Neutral Accounting Firm that varies
the greatest amount from the final Earnout Payment amount determined by the
Neutral Accounting Firm hereunder, and if such party is the Representative, then such fees, costs and expenses shall be borne by the Representative solely
on behalf of the Rights Holders. Parent shall make or cause to be made the
final Earnout Payment, if any, in the amount as determined by the Neutral
Accounting Firm promptly after such final determination, but in no event more
than five (5) Business Days thereafter, in the manner set forth in Section
1.16(a) or Section 1.16(b), as applicable. Any such final Earnout Payment
shall be made without any interest or penalty.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any dispute,
controversy or claim arising solely out of or relating solely to the
calculation of any Earnout Payment amount (including the determination of
whether any IoT Revenue and Broadcast Revenue derives from Products) shall be
settled pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in this Section
1.16(d) and any dispute, controversy or claim that is not arising solely out
of, or relating solely to, the calculation of any Earnout Payment shall be
settled pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Section
4.4(e) and (f).

Products or (2) used internally by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries and, in each
case, which is material for NMI's business as currently conducted or as
planned to be conducted, in each case excluding commercially available
standard software; and (vii) Trade Secrets that NMI has specifically

if applicable. Except as provided in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, NMI is the sole and exclusive legal and beneficial owner of all
right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property listed in
Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. If and to the extent that NMI is
the co-owner of any Intellectual Property listed in Section 2.11(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, or any designs, specifications, application programming
interfaces, documentation, datasheets or application notes (to the extent they
are Intellectual Property) relating to products currently distributed or sold
by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries, such co-ownership is expressly indicated in
Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, and specifies (x) the name of all
of NMI's or its Subsidiaries' co-owner(s), and (y) any agreements (if any)
between NMI or any of its Subsidiaries and the respective co-owner(s) relating
to the terms and conditions of the joint ownership. All of the Owned
Intellectual Property is subsisting, and, except for applications or filings,
to NMI's Knowledge, valid and enforceable. For such Intellectual Property
listed in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule as is subject to any
issuance, registration, application or filing by, to or with any governmental
authority or authorized private registrar ("IP Registrations"), all required
filings and fees have been timely filed with and paid to the relevant
Governmental Entities and authorized registrars, and all IP Registrations are
in good standing. None of the Patents in the Owned Intellectual Property is
subject to a terminal disclaimer with respect to a Patent that is not in the
Owned Intellectual Property.

(b) The Intellectual Property listed in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, and all material unregistered Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Know-How
that are owned by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries and comprised within NMI's or
its Subsidiaries' Intellectual Property ("Owned Intellectual Property"), each
are, except as set forth in Section 2.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, free
and clear of any mortgages, Liens, pledges, security interests, charges,
claims, restrictions and other encumbrances (excluding the Permitted Liens)
and, subject to the Contracts listed in Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
Contract with any third party resulting in any other condition or restriction
(other than Permitted Liens) limiting the use of the Owned Intellectual
Property.

(c) Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all (i) Contracts under which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries
uses or is permitted to use any Intellectual Property other than Owned
Intellectual Property and other than Generally Available Software, and (ii)
Contracts under which NMI, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates have granted to others the right to use or has granted others a
covenant not to assert or not to sue for use of, any of its Owned Intellectual
Property (other than non-exclusive technology licenses to Owned Intellectual Property granted in the ordinary course of business in connection with the
sale and distribution of Products, none of which contains or includes any form
of covenant not to assert or not to sue in respect of any Patents). To NMI's
Knowledge, there are no outstanding or threatened disputes or disagreements
with respect to the Contracts listed in Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule. All Contracts listed in Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule accurately reflect all obligations of NMI and each of its
Subsidiaries to pay any License Fees or other consideration in respect of the
rights granted to NMI or its Subsidiaries thereunder. Other than the License
Fees payable (1) to the persons, and (2) under the Contracts listed in Section
2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligation to pay license fees, royalties or similar contractual
payment obligations for the use of Intellectual Property ("License Fees") to
any person as of the Execution Date, with the exception of License Fees
payable for the use of any commercially available standard Software. The
manufacture or sale of NMI Products does not require a license under any
patent pool (including patent pools related to 802.11 or any other wireless
standards) or from any industry standards body, trade associations or other
organizations (including MPEG-LA and Via Licensing) pursuant to the rules of
which any of those bodies, associations or organizations, or any members
thereof, are obligated or undertakes to license Intellectual Property to third
parties. Except for Standard Essential Patents that are licensed to NMI or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to contracts disclosed under Section 2.11(c)(i) of the

Standard Essential Patents to practice any of the technologies incorporated in
its products. Except as described in Section 2.11(c)(ii) of the Disclosure
Schedule, neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a member of, or party to,
any patent pool, industry standards body, trade association or other
organization pursuant to the rules of which it is obligated to license, or
otherwise provide any access to, any Owned Intellectual Property to any third
party. None of the licenses granted by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, will, by their terms, apply
to Parent and Parent's other affiliates solely in Parent's capacity as an
"affiliate" of NMI or any of its Subsidiaries, assuming that the Merger is
consummated.

(d) Neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries requires the use of any
Intellectual Property other than (i) Owned Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property licensed, under effective and fully paid up licenses
listed in Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) licenses to
Generally Available Software, or (iii) licenses to open source software listed

currently conducted, and no licenses to any such Intellectual Property will
cease to be binding and in full force and effect due to consummation of the
Merger.

(e) None of the material portions of any Software source code that is part of
the Owned Intellectual Property and (i) incorporated and contained in or (ii)
used in the development of the Products or Software currently distributed by
NMI or any of its Subsidiaries (the "NMI Source Code") have been made
available by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries to any third parties without
imposing reasonable confidentiality obligations on such third parties, and NMI
and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable measures to safeguard any
NMI Source Code. To the Knowledge of NMI, all Products consisting of Software
were, at the time of delivery to the applicable end user, free of viruses,
worms, Trojan Horses or other similar malicious code. Neither NMI nor any of
its Subsidiaries has incorporated into any Product or Software currently
distributed or under development by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries any open
source software that is subject to any "copyleft" or other obligation or
condition that, when used and distributed in the manner currently used and
distributed by NMI (i) requires or conditions the use or distribution of the
applicable Product or Software on the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any NMI Source Code, or (ii) otherwise imposes any limitation,
restriction or condition (x) requiring the distribution or licensing of NMI
Source Code, or (y) on the right or ability of NMI or any of its Subsidiaries
to use or distribute the applicable Product or Software.

(f) Unless otherwise set out in Section 2.11(f)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule,
NMI and each of its Subsidiaries has paid all due and necessary registration
and renewal fees for and has taken reasonable steps to protect and validly
maintain the Owned Intellectual Property. Unless otherwise set forth in
Section 2.11(f)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) there is currently no
pending litigation or other proceeding, and (ii) to the Knowledge of NMI,
there is no threatened litigation or other proceeding that involves NMI or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to Intellectual Property, or that challenges
the validity or enforceability of, or contests NMI's or any of its
Subsidiaries' rights with respect to, any Owned Intellectual Property (other
than normal patent and trademark prosecution proceedings). Neither NMI nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received from any third party any written assertion or
claim challenging the validity or enforceability of, or contesting NMI's or
any of its Subsidiaries' rights with respect to, any Owned Intellectual
Property or any Contract listed in Section 2.11(c)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule relating to such Owned Intellectual Property.

(g) With regard to all members of the staff of NMI and each of its
Subsidiaries, and their respective independent contractors, agents,
representatives, consultants or other third parties named as inventors in the
Patents listed in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and all other
members of staff of NMI and each of its Subsidiaries who have developed or may
reasonably be expected to develop Intellectual Property related to the
business of NMI and its Subsidiaries and all independent contractors, agents,
consultants or other third parties that currently work for NMI or any of its
Subsidiaries with the intention to develop Intellectual Property related to
the business of NMI and its Subsidiaries, in each case, in the course of
performing their duties to NMI or a Subsidiary (the "NMI Development Person")
to the extent permitted by applicable law, NMI and each of its Subsidiaries
has undertaken the necessary steps to either (i) become, and has become, the
sole and exclusive owner of the NMI Development Person's interest in such
Intellectual Property and all Patents with respect thereto, or (ii) acquire,
and has acquired, from such NMI Development Person the exclusive right to
exercise all economic rights in such Intellectual Property and all Patents

the Disclosure Schedule there are no further Persons (including all NMI
Development Persons) who have contributed to the inventions covered by Patents
listed in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. To the extent any
Software listed in Section 2.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule or other Owned
Intellectual Property has been developed by any NMI Development Person in the
execution of his or her respective duties to NMI or a Subsidiary, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Laws, NMI or such Subsidiary has secured valid
assignments of ownership (and other legal rights), and has acquired the
exclusive right to exercise all their economic rights, in such Software or
Owned Intellectual Property. As far as Software listed in Section 2.11(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule or other Owned Intellectual Property was created by
independent contractors, agents, consultants or other third parties for NMI or
any of its Subsidiaries, NMI or such Subsidiary has secured therefrom valid
assignments of ownership (and other legal rights), or otherwise acquired the
exclusive right to exercise all their economic rights in such Software or
other Owned Intellectual Property.

(h) Except as provided in Section 2.11(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, no NMI
Development Person has asserted any payment claims in respect of any
Intellectual Property in addition to the remuneration expressly agreed in the applicable employment or service
Contract and, as of the Execution Date, no NMI Development Person is entitled
to any such additional payment claim.

otherwise conflicts, or has infringed upon, misappropriated, diluted, violated
or otherwise conflicted in any way any Intellectual Property of any third
party, and (ii) no person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise
violated, or is currently infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise
violating, any Owned Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding anything else, (a)
with respect to third party Patents and Trademarks, the foregoing
representations are made only to NMI's Knowledge and (b) no other provision of
this Agreement will be deemed to be a representation or warranty regarding
non-infringement of third party Intellectual Property.

(j) There are no Actions, assertions or other claims of any kind (including
patent office proceedings such as oppositions, interferences, or re-
examinations, but excluding normal patent prosecution proceedings) settled,
pending, threatened in writing or, to the Knowledge of NMI, otherwise
threatened (including in the form of offers to grant a license): (i) alleging
any infringement, misappropriation, dilution, violation or other conflict with
any Intellectual Property of any Person by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries;
(ii) challenging the validity, enforceability, registrability, or ownership of
any Owned Intellectual Property or NMI's or any of its Subsidiaries' rights
with respect to any Owned Intellectual Property; or (iii) by NMI or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other Person alleging any infringement, misappropriation,
dilution, violation or other conflict by any Person of the Owned Intellectual
Property, nor, to NMI's Knowledge, is there any Basis for such Action,
assertion or claim. Except as provided in Section 2.11(j) of the Disclosure
Schedule there are, to NMI's Knowledge, no infringements by any Person of any
Owned Intellectual Property or, to NMI's Knowledge, any breaches by any Person
of any licenses or other Contracts involving any Owned Intellectual Property,
and neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any claims alleging any
of the forgoing. Neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries are subject to any

Property.

(k) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11(k) to the Disclosure Schedule,
neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries has given or received any written
notice of, or, to the Knowledge of NMI, any other notice of, any default or of
any event that with the lapse of time would constitute a default under any
Material Contract relating to the Owned Intellectual Property. Neither NMI nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in default with regard to any Material Contract
relating to the Owned Intellectual Property, nor, to NMI's Knowledge, is any
other person in default with respect to any such Material Contract.

(l) NMI and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable measures to protect
the confidentiality of its material Trade Secrets and Trade Secrets of third
parties subject to confidentiality obligations, including obtaining
appropriate written confidentiality obligations in Contracts under which NMI
or any of its Subsidiaries licenses out or otherwise discloses any of such
material Trade Secrets to third parties. Neither NMI nor any of its
Subsidiaries is required under any license agreements, cooperation agreements,
sale or transfer agreements or any other agreements, including oral
agreements, to (i) enforce any statutory or common law rights it may have
against the misappropriation or misuse of its material Trade Secrets by any
third party, (ii) license or transfer its material Trade Secrets to third parties, or (iii) otherwise use any of its material Trade Secrets. Except as
set forth in Section 2.11(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, and except for non-

non-disclosure agreements do not themselves contain a right of license to, or
any restrictions, limitations or covenants affecting, Owned Intellectual
Property), there are no Contracts in which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries
licenses in or out any material Trade Secrets. To NMI's Knowledge, no third

(e) Neither NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of,
or, to NMI's Knowledge, any other notice of, any pending deficiency of NMI or
any of its Subsidiaries proposed by any Tax authority or Governmental Entity.

(f) Adequate provisions have been made in the Financial Statements for the
payment of all Taxes for which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable
for the periods covered thereby that were not yet due and payable as of the
dates thereof, regardless of whether the liability for such Taxes is disputed.

payment by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries to any person of an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(h) There is no Contract or intercompany account system in existence under
which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries has, or may at any time in the future
have, an obligation to contribute to the payment of any portion of a Tax (or
pay any amount calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax) of any group
of corporations of which NMI or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a part
(other than a group of which NMI is the ultimate parent corporation).

resulting from each such examination or audit. Except as set forth in Section
2.23(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, no such examination or audit of NMI or any

set forth in Section 2.23(n) of the Disclosure Schedule, which have been
entered into on arms-length terms, consistent with Applicable Laws and
industry practices regarding transfer pricing and profit and expense
allocation among Affiliated Persons. There are no claims pending or, to the
Knowledge of NMI, threatened by any Tax authority or Governmental Entity
against NMI or any of its Subsidiaries, with respect to transfer pricing,
permanent establishment or withholding Taxes, nor, to the Knowledge of NMI, is
there any reasonable Basis for such a claim.

the case of leased Tangible Assets, indicating the parties to, execution dates
of and annual payments under, the lease.

(b) NMI has good, valid and transferable title to all of the Tangible Assets,
free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

(c) All leases under which Tangible Assets are leased are in full force and

Assets in a manner consistent with the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted.

(a) There are no warranties (express or implied) outstanding with respect to
any Products, or any services rendered by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries,

prior to the Closing Date performed in all material respects in conformity
with applicable warranties and specifications provided by NMI or any of its
Subsidiaries to any customer that purchased such Products from NMI or any of
its Subsidiaries (except that it shall not be deemed a breach of the foregoing
representation if a Loss results from a breach of product warranty for which
an adequate product warranty reserve has been established or reflected in the
Financial Statements). There are no material design, manufacturing or other
defects, latent or otherwise, with respect to any of the Products. Each
Product that has been manufactured, sold, distributed, shipped or licensed
prior to the Closing contains all warnings required by Applicable Law, and
such warnings are in accordance with reasonable industry practice.

2.27 Environmental Matters.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.27 of the Disclosure Schedule, neither
NMI nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated in any material respect any
Applicable Law relating to the environment, and, no material expenditures are

NMI and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses, and all of the premises
where they carry out their respective activities hold, all Permits that are
necessary to conduct the business of NMI and its Subsidiaries in compliance
with any Applicable Law relating to the environment, and all such Permits are
valid and in full force and effect.

(b) To NMI's Knowledge, no amount of any substance that has been designated by
any Governmental Entity or by Applicable Law to be radioactive, toxic,

including PCBs, asbestos, petroleum, and urea-formaldehyde and all substances
listed as hazardous substances pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or defined as a

ARTICLE IV 
INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

4.1 Indemnification. After the Effective Time, each Rights Holder agrees,
severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and all Subsidiaries of Parent and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns ("Indemnified Parties")
from any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses")
suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties ("Indemnified Loss"),
arising out of or resulting from (i) the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by NMI contained herein or in any schedule,
exhibit or certificate delivered under this Agreement, (ii) any inaccuracies
in the Spreadsheet; or (iii) any Special Indemnity Matters.

4.2 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement:

(a) The Indemnified Party's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all Losses shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the Escrow Amount;
except as provided in Section 4.5 below. No indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE IV shall be made unless the aggregate amount of Indemnified Losses
incurred by the Indemnified Parties hereunder exceeds Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case, subject
to Section 4.4, the entire amount of all Indemnified Losses suffered by the
Indemnified Parties (from the first dollar of Loss without reference to the
Threshold Amount) shall be recoverable by the Indemnified Parties; provided,
however, that indemnification claims with respect to any Special Losses shall
be (i) recoverable from the first dollar of Loss without any reference to, or
any requirement to exceed, the Threshold Amount, and (ii) included,
notwithstanding the preceding clause (i), as Indemnified Losses for the
purposes of determining whether the Threshold Amount has been realized or
exceeded.

(b) No Indemnified Party may make a claim for indemnification under Section
4.2 for breach by the Indemnifying Party of a particular representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by NMI contained herein, in any schedule,
exhibit or certificate delivered under this Agreement or in respect of any
Loss, including any Special Losses, after the expiration of the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 2.30; provided that any (i) claim arising
in connection with a Claim Notice delivered on or prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period shall survive (and shall be fully "tolled" for
all purposes of this Agreement) for the benefit of all Indemnified Parties
beyond the expiration of the applicable survival period until such claim is
finally resolved, and (ii) any Special Retention Claim Notice may be delivered at any time on or prior to the second anniversary of the
Effective Time irrespective of any applicable survival periods that may apply
to any other Claim Notices.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights and remedies
of the Indemnified Parties after the Closing shall not be limited by the fact
that any Indemnified Party had knowledge of any breach, event or circumstance
prior to the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Rights Holder shall
have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Losses that are
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policies (net
of any increases in premiums and costs of recovery), and the Indemnified Party
shall reimburse the Rights Holders in the event of recovery (net of any
increases in premiums and costs of recovery) subsequent to any indemnification
payment hereunder being made; provided that nothing in this Section 4.2(d)
shall be interpreted to require any Indemnified Party to obtain or maintain
insurance of any kind or at any level of coverage.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Indemnified Party
shall take commercially reasonable action to mitigate any Losses for which
such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement, including
enforcing any rights or remedies that may be available to such Indemnified
Party against third parties (including insurance providers and similar
arrangements), promptly upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses; provided that no Indemnified Party
shall be required under this Section 4.2(e) (i) to incur any material cost or
expense in taking such action, (ii) to take any action that would materially
prejudice such Indemnified Party's ability to recover any and all Losses for
which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement, (iii)
to take any action that would harm or adversely affect in any manner, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party's
business or its relationships with customers or suppliers, or (iv) in respect
of any matters related to a Special Retention Claim Notice, take any action,
or incur any cost or otherwise modify any of its business practices in any
manner, that would, in the sole discretion of Parent, adversely affect
Parent's ability to receive the intended benefits of the funds allocated to
the Special Retention Set Aside.

4.3 Materiality Determination. For the purpose of determining the amount of
Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by NMI contained herein or in any schedule, exhibit or
certificate delivered under this Agreement for purposes of this ARTICLE IV,
any "Knowledge" "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers or words
of similar import contained in such representation or warranty shall in each
case be disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification
were deleted from such representation or warranty); provided, however, that
such standard or qualification shall not be disregarded for the purposes of
the initial determination of whether there was a breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of NMI.

4.4 Escrow Fund.

(a) In order to support the Rights Holders' obligations under Section 4.1, the
Escrow Amount shall be delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and held in escrow (the "Escrow Account") for a
period of fifteen (15) months from the Effective Time, except that the Special
Retention Set Aside shall, to the extent not earlier released to Parent, be
retained by the Escrow Agent until the second anniversary of the Effective
Time (the "Escrow Period"). The total amount of funds held in escrow at any
time, including any interest earned thereon and reduced by any amounts paid out pursuant to this Article IV, is collectively referred to as
the "Escrow Amount." The Escrow Account and the Escrow Amount shall be subject
to the escrow agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Escrow Agreement"),
by and among the parties hereto and Citibank N.A. (the "Escrow Agent").

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the portion of the
consideration that is included in the Escrow Amount with respect to the Vested
Options described in Section 1.7(m) of this Agreement is subject to
substantial limitations or restrictions such that such portion of the
consideration is not constructively received by the holders for Tax purposes
at the time of Closing and is not intended to be compensation or wages, or
subject to withholding as such, until the distribution of such portion of the
Escrow Amount (if any) is determined, and (ii) the portion of the
consideration that is included in the Escrow Amount other than that portion
described in clause (i) above is intended to be treated as an installment
obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the Code, and no party shall take
any action or filing position inconsistent with such characterizations except
to the extent required pursuant to a "determination" as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code.

(c) The parties further acknowledge and agree that, consistent with Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, for Tax reporting purposes, all interest
or other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Amount, or any
portion thereof, in any taxable year shall be reported as allocated to Parent
until the distribution of the Escrow Amount (or portions thereof) is
determined and thereafter to Parent and the Rights Holders in accordance with
their respective interests in the Escrow Amount consistent with Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8. Any portion of any payments or
distributions to the Rights Holders that is treated as interest under Section
483 of Code or otherwise shall be treated as portfolio interest under Section
871(h) of the Code. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement are each intended by the parties to be a
book entry system maintained by Parent in accordance with Section 163(f) of
the Code for purposes of qualifying the Escrow Amount as an obligation in
registered form of Parent under Section 871(h) of the Code. No Rights Holder
shall assign its interest in the Escrow Amount to any person permitted by the
Escrow Agreement without first notifying Parent and the Representative in
writing of such transfer.

(d) In order to establish an expense account for use by the Representative for
the sole purpose of performing the Representative's duties under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Representative Expense Amount shall be
delivered by Parent to the Escrow Agent at the Closing in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. The total amount of funds held in the expense account,
including any interest earned thereon, is collectively referred to as the
"Representative Expense Amount." Any amounts in the Representative Expense
Amount not used solely in connection with bona fide expenses performing the
Representative's duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be
distributed to the Rights Holders on such date as the Representative directs;
provided, however, that the Representative shall be entitled, in its sole
discretion, to continue to have all or any portion of the Representative
Expense Amount continue in escrow if there is pending on such date a dispute
relating to any indemnification claim or any Earnout Payment.

(e) If at any time and from time to time prior to expiration of the Escrow
Period, an Indemnified Party makes a Claim, Parent shall deliver to the
Representative notification in writing (a "Claim Notice"), setting forth in
reasonable detail (i) the facts giving rise to such Claim, (ii) the reasonably
estimated amount of the Indemnified Loss and any associated expenses and costs
such as reasonable attorney fees, if known, and (iii) the provisions of this Agreement
upon which such Claim is based. In the event the Representative does not
dispute the Claim as set forth in the Claim Notice in a timely manner as set
forth in Section 4.4(d), or only disputes a portion thereof, then the amount
of the Claim described in the Claim Notice or the portion thereof not disputed
shall be deemed to be admitted (the "Admitted Liability") and Parent shall be
entitled to permanently reduce the Escrow Amount by, and receive from escrow,
the amount of the Admitted Liability with respect to such claim. The full
amount set forth in any Special Retention Claim Notice shall be deemed an
Admitted Liability and a Special Loss in an amount equal to (A) the Special
Retention Set Aside minus (B) the amount of all Special Retention Payments
released to Parent by the Escrow Agent, and shall not be subject to challenge,
dispute or objection by the Representative or the Rights Holders.

(f) In the event the Representative shall dispute the validity of all or any
amount of a Claim as set forth in the Claim Notice, the Representative shall,
within thirty (30) days of his receipt of the Claim Notice, execute and
deliver to Parent a notice setting forth with reasonable particularity the
grounds and the basis upon which the Claim or portion thereof is disputed (the
"Dispute Statement"); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Representative and the Rights Holders may not challenge, dispute or object to,
and Parent and the Escrow Agent shall not accept any Dispute Statement
relating to, any Special Retention Claim Notice, or any Claim for a Special
Retention Payment, to the extent that (i) sufficient funds remain available in
the Escrow Account at the time the Special Retention Claim Notice is received
by the Escrow Agent to pay all or a portion of the amounts set forth in the
Special Retention Claim Notice, and (ii) the amounts requested in any Special
Retention Claim Notice do not exceed (A) the Special Retention Set Aside minus
(B) the amount of all Special Retention Payments released to Parent by the
Escrow Agent through the date on which the Special Retention Claim Notice is
received by the Escrow Agent. If the Representative delivers to Parent a
Dispute Statement applicable to all or any portion of a Claim within the
period for delivery of the same set forth above, then the amount of the Escrow
Amount disputed by the Representative in such Dispute Statement shall not be
payable to Parent until either (i) Parent and the Representative agree in
writing to the resolution of the amount of the Escrow Amount disputed by the
Representative in such Dispute Statement, or (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction enters a final order that determines such Claim is not valid or
directing the payment to the Representative (on behalf of the Rights Holders)
of the amount of the Escrow Amount disputed by the Representative in such
Dispute Statement. Upon such written agreement or final order (a "Resolved
Claim"), as the case may be, Parent shall be entitled to permanently reduce
the Escrow Amount by, and receive from escrow, the amount of the Resolved
Claim if and to the extent that matters covered thereby have been resolved in
favor of Parent.



(g) Third Party Claims

(i) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
Loss or a claim, suit, demand or proceeding with any third party against the
Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice thereof to the Representative, on behalf of the Rights Holders
(the "Indemnifying Party"); provided, however, that no delay or failure on the
part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the Representative shall relieve an
Indemnifying Party from its obligations hereunder unless the Indemnifying
Party is thereby actually and materially prejudiced (and then solely to the
extent of such prejudice).

(ii) The Representative shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Representative and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Representative shall not have the right to assume such
defense of such Third Party Claim (1) to the extent that such Third Party
Claim involves potential criminal liability or equitable relief is sought, (2)
if the amount of Losses reasonably estimated to be incurred pursuant to such
Third Party Claim (when combined with all other outstanding claims for
indemnification under this ARTICLE IV) is greater than the Losses for which
the Indemnifying Party is liable under this ARTICLE IV, (3) if there exists
any legal conflict between the interests of Parent and those of the Rights
Holders or different defenses would be available if Parent controlled the
defense, (4) if such Third Party Claim relates to Intellectual Property or (5)
if any counterparty in such Third Party Claim is a customer of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent. If the Representative does not expressly elect to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period set forth in this
Section 4.4(e)(ii), is not eligible to assume the defense under the terms
hereof or fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the Representative assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Representative in such
defense and make available to the Representative all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or
under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Representative. If the Representative assumes the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Representative shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such settlement, compromise or judgment (w) involves a finding
or admission of wrongdoing, (x) does not include an unconditional written
release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (y) involves a license or
grant of any Intellectual Property or (z) involves the payment of any amount,
including any obligation to pay any amount in the future, by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation that would not be fully paid by the Representative
pursuant to the terms hereof, then the Representative shall not enter into any
such settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any such judgment
without the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party, which
consent may be granted in such Indemnified Party's sole and absolute
discretion.

(iii) The Person controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to
clause (ii) above shall consult with Parent (in the case the Representative is
the controlling party) or the Representative (in the event any other Person is
the controlling party) for the purpose of allowing such non-controlling party
to participate in such defense at such non-controlling party's expense.

(iv) No Indemnified Party shall settle, discharge or otherwise resolve
(whether or not in connection with a court, arbitration or other similar
dispute resolution mechanism) with any third party a dispute that is the basis
for a Claim for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this ARTICLE
IV without the consent of the Representative, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(h) Distribution of Escrow Amount. Subject to the requirements set forth in
this Section 4.4(h), the Escrow Account shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (Pacific
time) at the conclusion of the Escrow Period; provided, however, that on the
first Business Day following the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Escrow Agent shall deliver any funds then remaining in the
Escrow Amount to the Rights Holders, less (and the Escrow Agent shall retain
in the Escrow Account until the end of the Escrow Period): (i) any amounts
that Parent has informed the Escrow Agent in writing, prior to that fifteen (15) month anniversary, is necessary, in the reasonable judgment
of Parent, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in a Claim Notice (such
claims being referred to as the "Unsatisfied Claims"), and (ii) the amount
determined as the difference between (A) the Special Retention Set Aside minus
(B) the amount, if any, of all Special Retention Payments released to Parent
by the Escrow Agent. Immediately following the termination of the Escrow
Period, the parties shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay any funds remaining
in the Escrow Account to the Rights Holders that are not, as of the conclusion
of the Escrow Period, then subject to any Unsatisfied Claim or Special
Retention Claims Notice.

(i) Special Retention Payments. The Escrow Agent shall promptly distribute to
Parent, upon delivery of a Special Retention Claim Notice, the amount set
forth in that Special Retention Claim Notice to the extent that (i) sufficient
funds remain available in the Escrow Account at the time that the Special
Retention Claim Notice is received by the Escrow Agent and are not otherwise
subject to an Unsatisfied Claim, and (ii) the amount requested in the Special
Retention Claim Notice does not exceed (A) the Special Retention Set Aside
minus (B) the amount, if any, of all Special Retention Payments released to
Parent by the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
amounts set forth in Claims Notices that are not Special Retention Claims
Notices shall not reduce the amount of the Special Retention Set Aside
available to Parent hereunder for Special Retention Payments and there shall
not be any limitation on the number, or frequency, of Special Retention Claim
Notices that may be submitted by Parent, except that the amount released from
the Escrow Account shall not exceed (A) the Special Retention Set Aside minus
(B) the amount, if any, of all Special Retention Payments released to Parent
by the Escrow Agent.

4.5 Maximum Recovery. The maximum amount that the Indemnified Parties may
recover severally from the Rights Holders under this ARTICLE IV shall be
limited to the Escrow Amount, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the
following proviso and in the last sentence of this Section 4.5, provided,
however, that Claims arising out of, or relating to (a) the Special
Representations shall be limited to the amount of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, plus the Earnout Payments actually paid or due and payable to
the Rights Holders, if any, (b) Section 2.11 (Intellectual Property) shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, which amount is inclusive of the Escrow
Amount, plus the Earnout Payments actually paid or due and payable to the
Rights Holders, if any, and (c) any Working Capital Shortfall, fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation shall not be subject to, and shall
not be considered in determining, any limitation of liability. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) no Rights Holder shall be liable for any amount of a Loss
that may be recovered by an Indemnified Party pursuant to ARTICLE IV in excess
of such Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share (including the amount of any Earnout
Payments actually paid or due and payable to such Rights Holder) of such Loss,
except as contemplated by clause (ii) hereafter, (ii) the limitations of
liability set forth in this ARTICLE IV will not apply to Claims of fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation with respect to a Rights
Holder that committed the fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation, and (iii) the Indemnified Parties shall be required to
first exhaust the Escrow Amount prior to seeking further indemnification
recourse directly against any Rights Holders, other than with respect to
claims for fraud, willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation made
directly against a Rights Holder who committed the fraud, willful misconduct
or intentional misrepresentation. Parent shall have the right to set off
against any Earnout Payment actually due and payable to the Rights Holders any
amounts for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified in excess
of the Escrow Amount (if, and to the extent that, the Escrow Amount is
insufficient to provide any required indemnification payment) as expressly permitted by (1) clauses (a)
and (b) of the proviso included in the first sentence of this Section 4.5 or
(2) the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Losses recovered from the Escrow Account shall be allocated pro rata
among Rights Holders that have contributed to the Escrow Account.

4.6 Representative.

(a) At the Closing, Shareholder Representative Services LLC shall be
constituted and appointed as the representative of the Rights Holders (the
"Representative"), and the Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
Each Rights Holder, by virtue of its execution and delivery of the Stockholder
Consent and/or a Joinder Agreement, and/or the surrender of Certificates,
Vested Options and/or Warrants in exchange for the applicable portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, or
by virtue of the conversion of its shares into the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as a result of the
Merger shall be deemed to have appointed and constituted the Representative as
its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact with the powers and authority
as set forth in this Agreement, with full power of substitution and shall be
deemed to be coupled with an interest and shall survive the death or
incapacity of such Rights Holder. The Representative shall be the exclusive
agent for and on behalf of the Rights Holders to (i) give and receive notices
and communications to or from Buyer or the Escrow Agent (on behalf of itself
or any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Merger, including the Earn-Out Payments; (ii) authorize
deliveries of any Indemnified Losses and legally bind each Rights Holder to
pay cash directly to Buyer in satisfaction of claims asserted by Buyer (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party, including by not objecting to
such claims); (iii) object to such claims in accordance with Section 4.4(f);
(iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders with respect to, such
claims; (v) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without
having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance;
(vi) execute for and on behalf of each Rights Holder any amendment to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or any exhibit, certificate, waiver, annex or
schedule hereto or thereto or any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1; and (vii) enter into the Escrow Agreement. The Representative
shall be the sole and exclusive means of asserting or addressing any of the
above, and no Rights Holder shall have any right to act on its own behalf with
respect to any such matters, other than with respect to any claim or dispute
against the Representative. This appointment of agency and this power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and will not be
terminated by any Rights Holder or by operation of Law, whether by the death
or incapacity of any Rights Holder or the occurrence of any other event, and
any action taken by the Representative will be as valid as if such death,
incapacity or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether or not any
Rights Holder or the Representative will have received any notice thereof. If
the Representative resigns, refuses or is no longer capable of serving as the
Representative hereunder, then the Rights Holders will promptly appoint a
successor Representative who will thereafter be a successor Representative
hereunder; provided that, in the case of resignation or refusal, except in the
event that Representative is required by Applicable Law or an Order, or is
otherwise incapable of serving, the Representative will serve until such
successor is duly appointed and qualified to act hereunder. If there is not a
Representative at any time, any obligation to provide notice to the
Representative will be deemed satisfied if such notice is delivered to each of
the Rights Holders at their addresses last known to Buyer. All expenses, if
any, incurred by the Representative in connection with the performance of its duties as the
Representative will be borne and paid by the Rights Holders. No bond will be
required of the Representative, and the Representative will not receive any
compensation for its services other than pursuant to that certain engagement
letter to be entered by and among the Representative, NMI and certain Rights
Holders. Notices or communications to or from the Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Rights Holders.

(b) The Representative shall not be liable to any Rights Holder for any act
done or omitted hereunder as the Representative while acting in good faith and
any act done or omitted in accordance with the advice of counsel or other
expert shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Rights Holders
shall severally in accordance with each Rights Holder's Pro Rata Share, and
not jointly, indemnify the Representative, defend and hold it harmless against
any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided that in the event that
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative,
the Representative will reimburse the Rights Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative
by the Rights Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Representative from (i) the funds in the Representative Expense Amount, and
(ii) the amounts in the Escrow Amount at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Rights Holders; provided that while this
section allows the Representative to be paid from the Representative Expense
Amount and the Escrow Amount, this does not relieve the Rights Holders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Rights
Holders or otherwise. The Rights Holders acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) The Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about Buyer, NMI, or any Indemnified Person to
anyone (except as required by law and to the Rights Holders or the
Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or
authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case who agree to
treat such information confidentially).

(d) By its signature to this Agreement, the initial Representative hereby
accepts the appointment contained in this Agreement, as confirmed and extended
by this Agreement, and agrees to act as the Representative and to discharge
the duties and responsibilities of the Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the

numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

shall submit to the holders of NMI Capital Stock for approval (in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) by such number of holders of NMI Capital
Stock as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any
payments or benefits that may separately or in the aggregate, constitute
"parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G
Payments") (which determination shall be made by NMI and shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld), such
that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G
Payments (the "Section 280G Stockholder Approval").

5.11 Employee Benefits Covenants.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to Section 5.11(c), Parent and will
NMI mutually determine which full-time employees of NMI or any of its
Subsidiaries will receive either offers of continued employment from Parent or
its Affiliates (the "Retained Employees") or transitional offers to work as
"independent contractors" for a limited period of time post-Closing (the
"Transitional Contractors"), in each case so long as such employees are
employed by NMI or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to Closing.

(b) Parent or its Affiliates will, effective upon Closing, offer employment to
the Retained Employees on an at-will basis (to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law) and will review the cash compensation of Retained Employees on
or before the Closing in order to adjust such compensation to a level comparable to Parent employees with similar positions, experience,
responsibilities and qualifications; provided that the total cash compensation
(including wages, salaries, commissions and bonuses) of Retained Employees
will not be less favorable than the cash compensation provided by NMI or its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(c) Parent or its Affiliates will provide service credit to full-time
employees of NMI or any of its Subsidiaries who become full-time employees of
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent as of the Closing Date ("Continuing
Employees") under applicable Parent or Parent Affiliate employee benefit
plans, consistent with Parent's standard benefit plans and programs for
similarly situated employees and based on geographic locations (except to the
extent such service credit will result in the duplication of benefits);
provided, however, that: (i) specific terms of employment, or credit in
respect of, any individual employee as set forth in any offer letter or
employment agreement shall control and prevail in the event of any conflict
with the terms of this Section 5.11; (ii) prior service shall not be
recognized or credited with respect to eligibility or entitlement related to
incentive or performance bonuses, vacation, holiday or sick-leave entitlements
or accruals, or overtime payments; (iii) except to the extent expressly
specified in the offer letter received by an employee from Parent or its
Affiliate, prior service shall not be recognized or credited for the purpose
of eligibility for, entitlement to or participation in, any equity or quasi-
equity compensation plan offered by Parent or any of its Affiliates, including
customary Parent "rank and file" annual equity grant award reviews, other
special equity incentive programs made available to rank and file employees;
(iv) such prior service shall not be recognized or credited with respect to
eligibility or entitlement to any annual or special salary adjustments or
salary increases that may otherwise apply to Parent "rank-and-file" employees,
unless Parent otherwise determines; (v) all Continuing Employees of each of
NMI China and NMI Egypt shall, at Closing, have their employment status
consensually modified so that each such Continuing Employee is deemed to have
commenced his first fixed-term employment contract at the Effective Time (or,
in the case of employees of NMI Egypt, after the expiration of their current
fixed-term contract); and (vi) to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
Laws, for all purposes related to any of the benefits described in the
foregoing sub clauses (i) through (v), the first Business Day following the
Effective Time (or, in the case of employees of NMI Egypt, the first Business
Day after the expiration of their current fixed-term contract) shall be deemed
to be the "date of hire" for such employees by Parent or its applicable
Affiliate. Subject to the consent of any third-party insurer and Applicable
Law, no exclusion of conditions that are pre-existing as of the commencement
of the Continuing Employee's employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
will be imposed under Parent's employee benefit plans and programs except to
the extent applicable as of that date under the comparable plan or program of
NMI. Nothing in this Section 5.11(c) is intended to prevent Parent from
terminating any of its employee benefit plans from time to time, or changing
the form of benefits provided to the Continuing Employees after the Closing
Date, nor is anything contained in this Agreement intended to modify or affect
the at-will employment, where applicable, of any employee who accepts
employment with Parent or any Affiliate of Parent. No Person is an intended
third party beneficiary of this Section 5.11(c).

(d) NMI will fully pay all Unpaid Employee Bonuses at or prior to Closing, and
Parent and its Affiliates shall assume no obligation for, or have any
Liability in respect of, any Unpaid Employee Bonuses relating to, or arising
from, any time at or prior to Closing. (e) NMI will fully pay all Unpaid Employee Vacation Amounts at or prior to
Closing, and Parent and its Affiliates shall assume no obligation for, or have
any Liability in respect of, any Unpaid Employee Vacation Amounts relating to,
or arising from, any time at or prior to Closing.

Liens) on the assets of NMI and any of its Subsidiaries, including without
limitation any Owned Intellectual Property and the Liens listed in Schedule
5.13, to be released prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, and will
deliver evidence of each such release in a form acceptable to Parent in its
sole discretion at or prior to the Closing, and effective upon the Merger,
there shall be no Liens (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the assets of
NMI or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.14 Termination of Contracts. NMI shall cause the Contracts listed in
Schedule 5.14 to be terminated and be of no further effect as of the Closing
Date, and will deliver evidence of each such termination in a form acceptable
to Parent in its sole discretion at or prior to the Closing.

Closing, and deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing, the Payoff Letters
and the Satisfaction Letters. The Payoff Letters and the Satisfaction Letters

the Closing, and deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing evidence of such
action having been taken in a form acceptable to Parent in its sole
discretion, all of the actions specified in Schedule 5.16.

5.17 DandO Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) The Surviving Corporation will be bound by and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to continue to satisfy the rights of exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to which NMI's present and former
directors and officers (each, an "Indemnified DandO") are entitled with respect
to any act or omission occurring prior to the Effective Time under NMI's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or by contract or agreement, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of any such exculpation and
indemnification provisions as in effect on the Execution Date and previously
provided to Parent. Until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the
certificate of formation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing
documents) of the Surviving Corporation shall, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing, contain provisions no less favorable in the
aggregate with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses of each Indemnified DandO than are set forth in NMI's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the Execution Date, and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified DandO with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time. The rights of each Indemnified
DandO to indemnification or advancement of expenses under any indemnification
agreement are listed in Schedule 5.17 to the Disclosure Schedule, and Parent
and NMI further agree that all such rights, in addition to rights under NMI's
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Applicable Law, shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of
such agreement or law or, if earlier, until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date. (b) Prior to the Effective Time, NMI shall obtain, solely at its own cost and
expenses, a fully prepaid tail insurance policy, which policy may provide
Indemnified DandOs with directors' and officers' liability insurance at the
current level and scope of directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage as set forth in NMI's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Tail DandO
Insurance"), which Tail DandO Insurance shall provide coverage for a period
ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time. From the
Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer
shall not take any action intended to cancel or terminate the Tail DandO
Insurance, but in no event shall Buyer be required to expend any money in
connection with the maintenance of the Tail DandO Insurance.

5.18 IoT and Broadcast Revenues. NMI shall prepare, in a manner consistent
with GAAP, and deliver to Parent, at Closing, the First Earnout Period Pre-
Closing Revenue Statement, which shall set forth a true and correct schedule

Closing IoT Revenue and the First Earnout Period Pre-Closing Broadcast
Revenue.

required by the Delaware Code. After the Closing this Agreement shall not be

and delivery of this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby,
between the Rights Holders, NMI, and their respective counsel, including

Holders or the Representative, on the other hand, none of Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
Parent, Sub or the Surviving Corporation may claim that such attorney-client
communications are discoverable or subject to any waiver of the privilege
solely as a consequence of Parent's acquisition of NMI. The Rights Holders or
the Representative may, however, choose to waive the privilege in their sole
discretion. Other than as explicitly set forth in this Section 8.4, the
parties acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege belonging to NMI prior
to the Closing shall survive and continue, after the Closing, to be a
privilege of NMI, and not the Rights Holders or the Representative.

this Agreement, to (a) one or more of its Affiliates, (b) by operation of law,
or (c) in connection with any merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of its assets or in connection with any similar transaction,
but no such transfer or assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the successors and assigns of NMI and Buyer, provided that the parties
hereto shall continue to be obligated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

hereto and thereto shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in

have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto.
