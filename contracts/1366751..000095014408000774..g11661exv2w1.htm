 _CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT_   

  

 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. 

   

 (a) The " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " shall be equal to: 

  

 (i) $420,000,000, 

  

 (ii) _plus_ the sum of : 

  

 (A) the Working Capital Overage, if any; 

  

 (B) the Acquisition Costs, if any; and 

  

 (C) the Per Diem Amount; 

   #####

The " _Per Share Price_ " shall be an amount equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (a) the excess of (i) the Estimated Purchase Price over (ii) the Aggregate Option Consideration _by_ (b) the number of Shares outstanding as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Option Cancellation). 

  

 (c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Chief Financial Officer of Critical Homecare Solutions, Inc. shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate of (i) Closing Working Capital prepared in accordance with Balance Sheet Rules and the resulting Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage (the " _Working Capital Estimate_ "), (ii) the amount of Company Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Company Indebtedness Amount_ "), which shall include the Credit Agreement Payoff Amount and the amount of Assumed Indebtedness prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules (the " _Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount_ "), and (iii) the amount of Company Expenses. 

  

 2.2 _Transactions to be Effected at the Closing_. At the Closing, the following transactions shall be effected by the parties: 

   

 (a) the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer Tax stamps, if any, affixed; 

  

 (b) the Buyer shall pay to each Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in writing by each such Seller (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), the sum of the product of (i) the Per Share Price  _multiplied_ by (ii) the number of Shares owned by such Seller as listed on _Annex A_  attached hereto; provided, further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any portion of the Estimated Purchase Price attributable to a Special Adjustment shall be payable in either cash or Buyers Stock (which shall be valued at the Closing Date Value), in the Buyers sole and absolute discretion; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) the Buyer shall deliver to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account of the Company designated in writing by the Company (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing) an amount equal to the Aggregate Option Consideration; 

  

 (d) the Company shall pay to each Optionholder (at the Companys option, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, check or direct deposit) an amount equal to such Optionholders allocable portion of the Aggregate Option Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.4_ herein; _provided_ that with respect to each Option, the amount paid to an Optionholder shall be reduced by all applicable Withholding Amounts, if any, with respect to the exercise of the underlying Option in accordance with _Section 2.4_ herein; provided, further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any portion of the Estimated Purchase Price attributable to a Special Adjustment shall be payable in either cash or Buyers Stock (which shall be valued at the Closing Date Value), in the Buyers sole and absolute discretion; 

  

 (e) the Buyer shall deliver to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account of the Company designated in writing by the Company (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an amount equal to the Credit Agreements Payoff Amount; 

  

 (f) The Company shall pay the Credit Agreements Payoff Amount to the Bank; 

  

 (g) the Buyer shall deliver to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account of the Company designated in writing by the Company (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an amount sufficient to pay the Company Expenses; 

  

 (h) the Company shall pay the Company Expenses; 

  

 (i) the Buyer shall deliver (a) the Buyers Stock to be held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (b) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent; and 

  

 (j) the Sellers party to the Subscription Agreement shall deliver by wire transfer by immediately available funds to such bank account of the Buyer designated in writing by the Buyer (such designation to be made two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an aggregate amount equal to $35,000,000, which amount shall be allocated as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(j)_. 

  

 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers Representative a statement (the " _Statement_ ") of the Closing Working Capital and the Assumed Indebtedness, in each case prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. The Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge that no adjustments shall be made to the Base Amount. 

   ##### 

 

   

 (b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following the date on which the Statement was delivered to the Sellers Representative, unless the Sellers Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include good faith disagreements based on Closing Working Capital and/or Assumed Indebtedness not being calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer on the earlier of (i) the date the Sellers Representative and the Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_. During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such thirty (30)-day period the Sellers Representative and the Buyer have not resolved in writing the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in accordance with the standards set forth in this  _Section 2.3(b)_, only such matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be KPMG LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer in writing. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any determination as to whether the Base Amount, Working Capital Estimate or the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness are correct. The Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer and their respective representatives and not by independent review and shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be borne pro rata as between the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in proportion to the final allocation made by such Accounting Firm of the disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer, such that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. 

   

 (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Working Capital_ " means the Closing Working Capital and " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " means the Assumed Indebtedness, in each case as finally agreed or determined in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased (any such increase, the " _Seller Adjustment_  

    

17 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

 _Amount_ ") by the _sum_ of (i) the amount, if any, that the Final Working
Capital exceeds the Working Capital Estimate and (ii) the amount, if any,
that the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount exceeds the Final Assumed
Indebtedness. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be decreased (any such
decrease, the " _Buyer Adjustment Amount_ ") by the _sum_ of (i) the amount,
if any that the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Final Working Capital and
(ii) the amount, if any, that the Final Assumed Indebtedness exceeds the
Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount. If the Seller Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Buyer Adjustment Amount, the Buyer shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Working Capital and the Final Assumed
Indebtedness are determined, make payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Sellers and the Optionholders in accordance with their
respective Adjustment Amount Transaction Percentage in the amount of any such
excess; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any portion of the Seller Adjustment Amount attributable to
a Special Adjustment shall be payable in either cash or Buyers Stock (which
shall be valued at the Closing Date Value), in the Buyers sole and absolute
discretion. If the Buyer Adjustment Amount exceeds the Seller Adjustment
Amount, the parties shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Working Capital and the Final Assumed Indebtedness are determined, cause the
Escrow Agent to release a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Buyer from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund in an amount equal to
any such excess in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; 
_provided_ that in the event such payment amount exceeds the amount of the
then available Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the shortfall shall be
paid from the available Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (d) No actions taken by the Buyer on its own behalf or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on or following the Closing Date shall be given effect for purposes of determining the Closing Working Capital or Assumed Indebtedness. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the final determination and payment of Closing Working Capital and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, the Buyer shall afford, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to afford, to the Sellers and any accountants, counsel or financial advisers retained by the Sellers in connection with the review of Closing Working Capital and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, direct access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel, representatives (including the Companys accountants) and records of the Company, each Company Subsidiary and such representatives (including the work papers of the Companys accountants) relevant to the review of the Statement and the Buyers determination of Closing Working Capital and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. 

   

 2.4 _Treatment of Options_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Company to take all actions necessary so all Options then outstanding shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not currently exercisable) and, immediately prior to the Closing, each Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled without any future liability to the Buyer, the Company or any other Person after the Closing, in exchange for the right to receive the payment described in the following sentence (such payments in the aggregate, the " _Aggregate Option Consideration_ "). The Company shall cause each Optionholder exercising any Options prior to the Closing to agree in writing to become a party to this Agreement as a Seller and to be bound by, and subject to, all of the covenants, terms and conditions of this Agreement that are binding upon the Sellers and the Annexes attached hereto shall be deemed to 

    ##### 

  

    

have been updated without any further action of the parties hereto to
reflect that each such Optionholder has become a Seller. Subject to the other
provisions of this  _Section 2.4_, each holder of an Option that is
cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall, in respect of each such Option,
be entitled to a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (I) the
excess, if any, of (i) the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the Estimated
Purchase Price _plus_ the aggregate exercise price of all Options outstanding
as of the time of cancellation _by_ (B) the sum of the total number of Shares
outstanding as of the Closing (after giving effect to the Option
Cancellation) and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to all Options
outstanding at the time of cancellation _over_ (ii) the applicable
Exercise Price of each Option, _multiplied_ _by_ (II) the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying such Options. The Company shall be entitled to, and
the Buyer will cause the Company at the Closing to, deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_ to any
Optionholder such amounts (the " _Withholding Amounts_ ") as the Company is
required to deduct and withhold in connection with the exercise of the
underlying Option or with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law and to properly
remit such amount to the appropriate Tax authority. To the extent that
Withholding Amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Company, such
Withholding Amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and
shall be included in the Aggregate Option Consideration as having been paid
to the Optionholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made by the Company. To the extent permissible by applicable law, the Sellers
and the Buyer shall treat, and cause their Affiliates to treat, the U.S.
federal and state income tax deductions resulting from the payment
obligations of the Company in cancellation of the Options described in this
Section 2.4, the U.S. federal and state income tax deductions resulting from
the accrual or payment of any Indebtedness, "change in control" and "stay
bonus" or similar payments as deductible in the Pre-Closing Date Taxable
Period, and, in the case of a Straddle Period, as allocable for the purposes
of this Agreement to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period included in such
Straddle Period, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and the Buyer shall not treat, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to treat, the "next day" rule of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or any similar provision of state
or local Tax Law as applying to the deductions described in the previous
sentence, and no elections that would result in the ratable allocation of such
deductions shall be made under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) or
any similar provision of state or local Tax Law. 

   

 2.5 _Escrow Funds_. The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be used solely for the purposes set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.3(c)_ and shall terminate five (5) Business Days after the date on which each of the Final Working Capital and the Final Assumed Indebtedness are finally agreed or determined. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall (a) be used solely to satisfy any claims of the Buyer for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ made from and after Closing but on or before the Cut-Off Date applicable to the representation, warranty or covenant to which such claim(s) relates, (b) to the extent that the amount payable by the Sellers pursuant to  _Section 2.3(c)_, if any, exceeds the amount of the then available Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, be used solely for the purposes set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.3(c)_ and (c) terminate on the date which is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (other than with respect to claims in subparagraph (a) above). Any amounts in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund not so used shall be distributed to the Sellers and the Optionholders in accordance with their respective Adjustment Amount Transaction Percentages. Any amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund not so used shall be distributed to the Sellers based 

    ##### 

  

    

on such Sellers Indemnity Escrow Allocation Percentage as set forth opposite
such Sellers name on Annex D. The Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund and
the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall each be held and disbursed solely for the
respective purposes and in accordance with the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement. 

   

 2.6 _Relationship Among the Sellers_. 

   

 (a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers Representative as the sole representative of the Sellers to act as the agent and on behalf of such Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement, including for the purposes of: (i) making decisions with respect to the determination of the Closing Working Capital and Assumed Indebtedness under  _Section 2.3_; (ii) determining whether the conditions to closing in _ARTICLE IX_ have been satisfied and supervising the Closing, including waiving any condition, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion; (iii) taking any action that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE X_; (iv) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the amendment of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 13.2_; (v) accepting notices on behalf of the Sellers in accordance with  _Section 13.5_; (vi) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or entering into settlements and compromises of any claim for indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE XI_ hereof, (vii) delivering or causing to be delivered to the Buyer at the Closing certificates representing the Shares to be sold by the Sellers hereunder; (viii) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Sellers, any and all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the Sellers, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ix) granting any consent, waiver or approval on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement. As the representative of the Sellers under this Agreement, the Sellers Representative shall act as the agent for all Sellers, shall have authority to bind each such Person in accordance with this Agreement, and the Buyer may rely on such appointment and authority until the receipt of notice of the appointment of a successor upon two (2) Business Days prior written notice to the Buyer. The Buyer may conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or investigation, all decisions made by the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement in writing and signed by an officer of the Sellers Representative. 

  

 (b) Each Seller hereby appoints the Sellers Representative as such Sellers true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, in such Sellers name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with the sale of such Sellers Shares as fully to all intents and purposes as such Seller might or could do in person. In acting as the sole representative of the Sellers hereunder prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative shall take such actions consistent with and in accordance with the terms of the CHS Stockholders Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Sellers Representative (in its capacity as Sellers Representative) shall have no liability to the Buyer for any default under this Agreement by any 

   ##### 

  

    

other Seller. Except for fraud or willful misconduct on its part, the
Sellers Representative shall have no liability to any other Seller under
this Agreement for any action or omission by the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the other Sellers. 

  

 (d) The Company shall cause each Optionholder to execute a separate document pursuant to which such Optionholder shall grant the Sellers Representative all rights granted to the Sellers Representative by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.6 (as may be applicable to the Optionholders) and shall promptly provide the Buyer a copy thereof.

Each party represents and warrants to the other party that all such information shall be true and correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (for the avoidance of doubt, this sentence shall be deemed a representation and warranty and not a covenant).

In the event that the Debt Financing is not available to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing; it being understood, however, that such commercially reasonable efforts would not require the Buyer to consummate the Debt Financing or any alternative financing, as the case may be, on financial terms less favorable, taken as a whole, or other terms materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Buyer than those set forth in the Debt Financing Documents (the " _Alternative Financing_ ").

supplement would result in the failure to satisfy a condition to the funding
of the Debt Financing at Closing; _provided_ , that in no event shall any
amendments or modification to the Debt Financing documents not required to be
consented to by the Company relieve the Buyer from its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set
forth in the Debt Financing Documents without giving effect to any such
amendment or modification made after the date hereof.

 11.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall (i) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Sellers under _Sections 11.2(a)_, on the one hand, or the Buyer under _Section 11.2(b)_, on the other hand, in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the then available Indemnification Escrow Fund (the " _Cap_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all breaches constituting Unrestricted Claims shall not be subject to the Cap and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Seller (other than a Kohlberg Entity) under _Section 11.2(a)_ and _Section 12.1_ exceed the amount of proceeds actually received by such Seller under this Agreement for the sale of such Sellers Shares on the Closing Date, _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to each Kohlberg Entity in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Kohlberg Entity or all of the Kohlberg Entities under _Section 11.2(a)_ and _Section 12.1_ exceed the amount of proceeds actually received by all of the Kohlberg Entities under this Agreement for the sale of Shares of the Kohlberg Entities on the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer Indemnitees, respectively, under  _ARTICLE XI_ for breaches of representations and warranties unless (i) any individual Loss or group or series of related Losses exceed $50,000 (such Loss or group or series of related Losses that does not exceed $50,000, the " _DeMinimis Losses_ "), and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under _Section 11.2(a)_ and _Section 11.2(b)_, respectively (which shall not include for such purposes DeMinimis Losses), exceed an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses (which shall include for such purposes any DeMinimis Losses) in excess of the Basket Amount 

   ##### 

  

 

up to the Cap;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all breaches of the

Subject to the last sentence hereof, the Buyer agrees and acknowledges on behalf of itself and the Buyer Indemnitees, that: (1) a Buyer Indemnitee must first assert any claim for indemnification under  _ARTICLE XI_ against the then available Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (2) if the amount recoverable by a Buyer Indemnitee in respect of a breach of a Seller Covenant or a Seller Representation, in each case with respect to any Unrestricted Claim of a Seller exceeds the amount of the then available Indemnification Escrow Fund or if the Escrow Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms, then (x) a Buyer Indemnitee shall assert such claim solely against that Seller who is in breach of the Unrestricted Claim, and no other Seller shall have any liability with respect to such Unrestricted Claim, and (y) in the case of an Unrestricted Claim that is a Company Representation or a Company Covenant, against the Sellers on a several basis based on their respective Seller Payment Transaction Percentage (and not on a joint or joint and several basis), for the amount of Losses not recovered by such Buyer Indemnitee from the then available Indemnification Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any such claim against a Kohlberg Entity, (i) the Buyer Indemnitees may assert a claim against any Kohlberg Entity for any breach by any other Kohlberg Entity of any Unrestricted Claim that is a breach of a Seller Representation or Seller Covenant and (ii) each Kohlberg Entity shall be liable based upon the aggregate Seller Payment Transaction Percentage of all Kohlberg Entities for the amount of Losses not recovered by such Buyer Indemnitee for such Unrestricted Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer agrees and acknowledges on behalf of itself and the Buyer Indemnitees that in no event shall the Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee have any recourse against the Indemnity Escrow Fund in respect of any claim against any Seller who has not contributed to the Indemnity Escrow Fund (each, a " _Non-Contributing Seller_ ") for the breach of a Seller Representation or a Seller Covenant of such Non-Contributing Seller, in which case the Buyer shall proceed directly and solely against such Non-Contributing Seller. 

  

 (d) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified for special, consequential or punitive damages, including diminution in value, multiple of earnings or profits theory, business interruptions, or loss of business opportunity or reputation damages (except to the extent included in a Third Party Claim). The party seeking indemnification under this _ ARTICLE XI_ shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis of an indemnification claim hereunder. 

  

 (e) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing, (ii) any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was included in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price (to the extent so included), including in the calculation of Final Working Capital and Final Assumed Indebtedness, (iii) for any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly delivered prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

applicable Cut-Off Date, (iv) any Losses to the extent which there is a
related amount expressly reserved against in the Financial Statements
and where such reserve was taken into account by Current Liabilities in the
definition of Final Working Capital and (v) any Losses to the extent that
they are included in the Bad Debt Adjustment. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) none of the limitations on the indemnification obligations of the parties hereto shall apply to claims based on fraud or intentional breaches and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers contained herein shall not be affected by any investigation conducted for or on behalf of, or any knowledge possessed or acquired at any time by, the Buyer or its Affiliates, employees, or representatives concerning any circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation with respect thereto. 

  

 11.4 _Indemnification Claim Process_. 

   

 (a) All claims for indemnification by either a Seller Indemnitee or a Buyer Indemnitee under this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with _Sections 11.4_ and  _11.5_. 

  

 (b) If a Buyer Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_, the Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative in writing of such claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (the " _Claims Notice_ "); _provided_ that, subject to _Section 11.3(e)_, the failure of the Buyer Indemnitee to promptly notify Sellers Representative shall not relieve the Sellers from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Sellers were actually prejudiced by such delay. 

  

 (c) If a Seller Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XI_, the Seller Indemnitee shall promptly deliver a Claims Notice to the Buyer;  _provided_ that, subject to _Section 11.3(e)_, the failure of a Seller Indemnitee to promptly notify the Buyer shall not relieve the Buyer from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Sellers were actually prejudiced by such delay. 

  

 (d) The Indemnitor shall have twenty-five (25) calendar days from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice. 

   

 (i) In the event that the Indemnitor (a) notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (b) provides the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, (i) the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully liable, the Indemnitor 

   ##### 

  

   

makes such payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein)
and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release; _provided_ , _that_ ,
the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in (but not control), the defense of such Third Party
Claim. 

   

 (ii) In the event that (a) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (b) the Indemnitor does not provide the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, (i) then the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully liable, the Indemnitor makes such payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and shall have joint control over the investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitor is determined to be liable pursuant to the terms hereof for such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for reasonable costs and expenses of such separate co-counsel. 

   

 (iii) In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense, Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, and the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) with respect to any such Third Party Claim for which the Indemnitor has provided to the Indemnitee an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate; _provided_ ,  _that_ , if the Indemnitor does not provide the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, the Indemnitee may enter into any settlement of, or consent to judgment with respect to any such Third Party Claim without waiving or otherwise adversely affecting any rights hereunder.  

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties shall
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. 

   

 (e) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.4(d)(i) and 11.4(d)(ii), if the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty-five (25) calendar days of receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume 

   ##### 

  

 

such defense, at its sole cost and expense upon delivery of notice to such
effect to the Indemnitor at any time after such 25 calendar day period. 

   

 (f) The Buyer Indemnitee shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to, provide reasonable cooperation with the Sellers Representative in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which a Buyer Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XI_ that the Sellers Representative has elected to control, including, but not limited to, by providing the Sellers Representative with reasonable access to books, records, employees and officers (including as witnesses) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. 

  

 11.5  _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall also (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the date such item was paid or accrued; _provided_ that, subject to _Section 11.3(e)_, the failure of the Buyer Indemnitee to promptly notify Sellers Representative shall not relieve the Sellers from Liability for such claims except and only to the extent that the Sellers were actually prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. 

   

 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 11.7 _Tax; Insurance; Other Indemnification_. The amount of any Losses suffered by an Indemnitee shall be reduced by any tax benefit to the extent utilized, any insurance or any other payments actually received pursuant to an indemnification under any Prior Purchase Agreement (net of the direct costs incurred in procuring such payments). The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company, to pursue any and all other commercially reasonable remedies to collect any indemnification or other amounts pursuant to the Prior Purchase Agreements covering the Loss that is the subject to the claim for indemnification to the extent that the Buyer determines in good faith that indemnification is available under a Prior Purchase Agreement. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are actually received by the Buyer with respect to any Losses after the Buyer has received indemnification proceeds hereunder, the Buyer shall promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the receipt or recovery of such proceeds or recoveries, pay to the applicable Sellers in accordance with the

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

Indemnity Escrow Allocation Percentage (or, solely to the extent such
indemnification proceeds were not received from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
the Seller Payment Transaction Percentage) or such other percentage as the
Sellers Representative shall direct an amount equal to the lesser of the (x)
amount of such recovery proceeds or benefits actually received in respect of
such claim and (y) the amount of indemnification Losses the Buyer received
from the Sellers in respect of such claim; _provided_ , that, for purposes of
valuing any Buyers Stock in satisfaction of indemnification Losses that the
Buyer received from the Sellers in respect of such claims, the Buyers Stock
shall be valued at the per share price paid by the Sellers pursuant to
the Subscription Agreement. 

   

 11.8  _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. It is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly. 

   

ARTICLE XII 

   

 _TAX INDEMNITY AND PROCEDURES_   

  

 12.1 _Indemnification_  

   

 (a) The Sellers on a several basis (and not a joint or joint and several basis) shall be responsible for and pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Losses (to the extent such amounts were not taken into account as Current Liabilities in the determination of Final Working Capital) as a result of: 

  

 (i) Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary imposed or sought to be imposed on the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Effective Date; 

  

 (ii) Without duplication, Taxes imposed or sought to be imposed on the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of breaches of the representations contained in  _Section 5.12_, the covenants and agreements set forth in  _Section 7.21_ of this Agreement, and any Losses arising from Taxes imposed on the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of a breach of any of the Company Covenants; 

  

 (iii) Taxes imposed or sought to be imposed on the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any taxable period pursuant to any obligation (other than an obligation solely between or among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are Subsidiaries on the Effective Date) to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary or other group basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or included the Company or any Subsidiary at any time on or before the Effective Date, including any such obligation arising under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or similar provision of state, local or foreign law; 

  

 (iv) Taxes incurred by Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Effective Date related to the item disclosed on Schedule 5.12(x)(iii) in excess of any amount accrued for such item in the calculation of Final Working Capital; and 

   ##### 

   

  

 (v) Taxes imposed on the Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary as a result of denial of any Relevant Deduction to the extent an amount was paid for the Tax benefit therefrom under Section 12.7. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Kohlberg
Entity shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees for any indemnification obligation of any Kohlberg Entity
pursuant to this _ARTICLE XII_. 

   

 (b) The indemnification obligations contained in _Section 12.1(a)_ shall be the sole remedy available to the Buyer in connection with Taxes, and such indemnification obligations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect until 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations, giving effect to extensions thereto, has expired with respect to each such Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations contained in this _Section 12.1_ shall not be subject to the limits on indemnification provided in  _Section 11.3_ , and claims for indemnification under this  _Section 12.1_ shall not be considered to be claims under _ARTICLE XI_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Seller (other than a Kohlberg Entity) under Section 11.2(a) and this Section 12.1 exceed the amount of proceeds actually received by such Seller under this Agreement for the sale of such Sellers Shares on the Closing Date, provided, further, that, with respect to each Kohlberg Entity in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any Kohlberg Entity or all of the Kohlberg Entities under Section 11.2(a) and this Section 12.1 exceed the amount of proceeds actually received by all of the Kohlberg Entities under this Agreement for the sale of Shares of the Kohlberg Entities on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the indemnity obligations contained in this Section 12.1 shall be subject to provisions of Section 11.7. 

  

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall indemnify the Sellers and their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Tax Indemnified Seller Parties_ ") against and hold harmless from any and all Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods beginning on the Effective Date other than amounts for which the Buyer is entitled to be indemnified by the Sellers under _Section 12.1(a)_. 

  

 (d) All amounts required to be paid by the Sellers pursuant to this _ARTICLE XII_ shall be paid first by the distribution of Buyer Shares from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Sellers obligations to indemnify the Buyer under this _ARTICLE XII_ shall not be subject to the expiration of the Escrow Agreement and shall not be limited to satisfaction from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (y) the Sellers on a several basis (and not a joint or joint and several basis) shall be liable for any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Article XII in excess of the then-available Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Kohlberg Entity shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer for any indemnification obligation of any Kohlberg Entity pursuant to this  _ARTICLE XI_. 

  

 12.2 _Tax Returns_. (a) The Sellers shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Sellers expense, and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to be 

    ##### 

  

    

filed with any Tax authority after the Closing Date and shall pay (or cause to
be paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared consistently with applicable law and consistently with past
practice to the extent permitted by applicable law. For the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to the income Tax Returns for the period ending on the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall have the sole discretion regarding whether
the net operating loss generated in such period (if any) will be carried back
or carried forward. The Sellers shall provide, or cause to be provided, a
draft of any such Tax Returns to the Buyer for its review at least 30
days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for filing
such Tax Return. The Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative of any
reasonable objections the Buyer may have to any items set forth in such draft
Tax Return and the Buyer and Sellers Representative agree to consult and
resolve in good faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any
such objections, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyer. The fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers
and the Buyer. 

   

 (b) If the Effective Date is not the same date as the Closing Date, then for purposes of calculating the taxable income of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date, and for purposes of preparing income Tax Returns for such period, taxable operating income for the month that includes the Closing Date (which shall not include Relevant Deductions, all of which shall be apportioned entirely to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period pursuant to Section 2.4) (the " _Closing Month Taxable Operating Income_ ") shall be calculated as follows: 

   

 (i) First, taxable income from operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (without taking into account Relevant Deductions) shall be calculated for the period beginning on the first day of the taxable period and ending on the Effective Date; 

   

 (ii) Second, taxable income from operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (without taking into account Relevant Deductions) shall be calculated for the period beginning on the first day of the taxable period and ending on the first day of the month following the Closing Date; 

   

 (iii) The difference between the amount calculated in (ii) above and the amount calculated in (i) above shall be the Closing Month Taxable Operating Income; 

 

The portion of the Closing Month Taxable Operating Income that shall be
apportioned to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period and included on the Tax
Return for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be the Closing
Month Taxable Operating Income multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of days in the calendar month that includes the
Closing Date to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of days in such calendar month. If the inclusion of
such portion of the Closing Month Taxable Operating Income on the income Tax
Returns for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date causes
the Companys consolidated tax group to have positive taxable income shown on
such Tax Returns, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount of the Tax
actually shown due with respect to the portion of the Closing Month Taxable
Operating Income 

  ##### 

  

   

apportioned to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are due. 

   

 (c) The Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company or any Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date. Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Returns_ ") shall be prepared consistently with past practice to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Seller Representative a draft of any Straddle Return at least 30 days prior to the due date, giving effect to extensions thereto, for filing such Tax Return, for review by the Sellers Representative. Sellers Representative shall notify the Buyer of any reasonable objections Sellers Representative may have to any items set forth in such draft Straddle Return and the Buyer and Sellers Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If the parties cannot resolve any such objections, the item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyer. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers and the Buyer. The Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative of any amounts due from the Sellers in respect of any Tax Return in respect of a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, and no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible. 

  

 (d) Except to the extent required by law, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the written consent of the Sellers which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 12.3 _Cooperation_. After the Closing, the Buyer and Sellers shall promptly make available or cause to be made available to the other, as reasonably requested (at the expense of the requesting party), and to any taxing authority, all information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities and potential Tax liabilities relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods prior to or including the Effective Date and shall preserve all such information, records and documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof. 

   

 12.4 _Contests_. 

   

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 12.4(b)_ below, whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are or may be liable under this Agreement, the Buyer shall, if informed of such an assertion, promptly inform the Seller Representative, and the Seller Representative shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Sellers may be liable under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that if such settlement may affect the liability for Taxes (or right to a tax benefit) for which the Buyer is 

   ##### 

  

    

liable (or to which the Buyer is entitled), such settlement shall not be
agreed to without the consent of the Buyer, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding  _Section 12.4(a)_, whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute, except to the extent such proceedings affect the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are liable under this Agreement, in which case such settlement shall not be agreed to by the Buyer without the consent of the Seller Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the procedures described in this  _Section 12.4_ shall govern all claims for Taxes, and such claims shall not be governed by  _Sections 11.4_ or _11.5_ of this Agreement. 

  

 12.5 _Refunds_. __  

   

 (a) The Sellers will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period to the extent (i) such amounts were not taken into account as Current Assets in the determination of Final Working Capital, (ii) such amounts do not relate to the period between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, and (iii) such credits or refunds do not arise from or relate to the "carryback" of a Tax item from a period beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period. The Buyer shall cause such refund to be paid to the Sellers promptly following receipt. 

  

 (b) Except as provided in _Section 12.5(a)_, the Company will be entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 12.6 _Tax Elections_. The Buyer shall not, without the prior consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make, or cause to permit to be made, any Tax election, or adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, or undertake any other extraordinary action on the Closing Date, that would materially affect the Taxes of the Sellers or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Date. 

   

 12.7 _Payment for Use of Relevant Deductions_. To the extent that a Relevant Deduction actually reduces the Companys liability for Taxes in a period beginning after the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2013 (by use of a net operating loss carryforward created as a result of claiming such Relevant Deduction), the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers in accordance with their respective Seller Payment Transaction Percentages) the amount of the Tax benefit actually realized by the Company. Such a Tax benefit will be considered to be "actually realized" if, and to the extent, it reduces the amount of Taxes due by the Company (or its consolidated tax group, if applicable) in a taxable period, determined by comparing (a) the amount of Tax that would be due for such period in the absence of the Relevant Deduction giving rise to the Tax benefit (but giving effect to all other items of loss or deduction available for such period and using all other Tax attributes available for such period) with (b) the amount of Tax that is due for such period taking into account such 

    ##### 

  

    

Relevant Deduction, to the extent it is available as a Tax deduction for use
in such period. The amount of such Tax benefit will be considered to be
realized on the date the Tax Return claiming such Tax benefit is filed with
the relevant taxing authority or, in the case of a refund generated by the
carryforward of a net operating loss, on the date when such refund is received
by the Company. The Buyer shall pay the amount of such Tax benefit to the
Sellers Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers in accordance with
their respective Seller Payment Transaction Percentages) within fifteen (15)
days after such date.

The Sellers shall have deposited with the Escrow Agent, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Escrow Agreement, stock certificates registered in the names of the Sellers evidencing the Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Sellers shall deposit with the Escrow Agent undated stock powers separate from the stock certificates representing the Buyer Shares, endorsed in blank. Without limiting the foregoing, any and all other rights with respect to the Buyer Shares in the Indemnity Escrow Deposit, including, without limitation, voting rights, shall be exercised by the Escrow Agent as directed by the Sellers Representative but in no event shall any of such rights be exercised in a manner inconsistent with or in violation of any of the provisions of the Escrow Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

   

 (d) The Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund will be held for the benefit of the parties hereto and will not be subject to any lien or attachment of any other creditor of any party hereto and will be used solely for the purposes and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Until such time as the Buyer Shares are released from the Indemnity Escrow Deposit in accordance with the provisions hereunder, the Sellers will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers all or a portion of the economic consequences associated with, or pledge or grant any security interest in, or otherwise encumber any of the Buyer Shares.

 (e) Neither the Escrow Agent nor any nominee shall be under any duty to take any action to preserve, protect, exercise or enforce any rights or remedies under or with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Deposit (including without limitation with respect to the exercise of any voting or consent rights, conversion or exchange rights, defense of title, preservation of rights against prior matters or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Escrow Agent is so requested in a written request of the Sellers Representative received by the Escrow Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which the Escrow Agent is requested therein to take such action (or such later date as may be acceptable to the Escrow Agent), the Escrow Agent shall execute or cause its nominee to execute, and deliver to the Sellers Representative a proxy or other instrument in the form supplied to it by the Sellers Representative for voting or otherwise exercising any right of consent with respect to any of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit held by it hereunder, to authorize therein the Sellers Representative to exercise such voting or consent authority in respect of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit (provided that the Escrow Agent shall not be obliged to execute any such proxy or other instrument if, in its reasonable judgment, the terms thereof may subject the Escrow Agent to any liabilities or obligations in its individual capacity). The Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty or responsibility to forward to any party, or to notify any party with respect to, or to take any action with respect to, any notice, solicitation or other document or information, written or otherwise, received from an issuer or other person with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Deposit, including but not limited to, proxy material, tenders, options, the pendency of calls and maturities and expiration of rights.

The Sellers Representative agrees that it shall send a copy of all notices or statements received or sent hereunder to each Seller within a reasonable period of time after receipt or delivery (as applicable) thereof. 

   

 2\. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, the Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent as follows: 

   

 (a) _Purchase Price Escrow Fund_. Within five (5) Business Days after the date that the Statement becomes final and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer as provided in Section 2.3(b) of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall give a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, and necessary wire instructions to make such disposition (the " _Purchase Price Disposition Notice_ "). In the event any payment is made out of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Optionholders, the Purchase Price Disposition Notice shall also include written instructions (including necessary wire instructions) from the Company (or its successor) for the payment of all applicable Withholding Amounts, if any, attributable to such payment out of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund to the Sellers Representative for the 

   ##### 

  

   

benefit of the Optionholders. Within three (3) Business Days of the receipt of
the Purchase Price Disposition Notice, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the
Purchase Price Escrow Fund as follows: 

   

 (i) _First_ , to the Buyer from the Purchase Price Escrow Deposit, in the amount, if any, as set forth in the Purchase Price Disposition Notice that is payable to the Buyer.

 (ii) except as otherwise directed by the Sellers Representative, the remainder of the Purchase Price Escrow Deposit, if any, and all accrued and unpaid PPA Interest shall be paid to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers and Optionholders based on such Sellers and Optionholders Adjustment Amount Transaction Percentage as set forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto (the " _Adjustment Amount Transaction Percentage_ "); _provided_ , that the amount paid to the Sellers Representative under this Section 2(a)(ii) for the benefit of an Optionholder based on such Optionholders Adjustment Amount Transaction Percentage shall be reduced by all applicable Withholding Amounts, if any, as set forth in the instructions from the Company (or its successor) included with the Purchase Price Disposition Notice, and all such applicable Withholding Amounts shall be paid by the Escrow Agent directly to the Company (or its successor) in accordance with the written instructions from the Company (or its successor).

 (iv) The Indemnity Escrow Deposit shall only be available (x) in the event the Purchase Price Escrow Deposit is insufficient to pay the Buyer the amount set forth in the Purchase Price Disposition Notice, (y) to pay for Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee for Taxes under Article XII of the Stock Purchase Agreement and (z) to pay for Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee under Article XI of the Stock Purchase Agreement (such Losses referred to in clause (z) above, " _Indemnification Losses_ "). 

   

 (v) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative acknowledge and agree that the Indemnity Escrow Deposit shall be the Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims under Section 11.2(a) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (other than Taxes or Unrestricted Claims).

    ##### 

  

     

 (vi) Except as otherwise directed by the Sellers Representative, not later than ten (10) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement until such time as the Indemnity Escrow Deposit is fully depleted, all accrued and unpaid Indemnity Interest shall be released by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers based on each Sellers Seller Payment Transaction Percentage. 

   

 (vii) Except as otherwise directed by the Sellers Representative, on the date which is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release all Buyer Shares remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (including any remaining accrued and unpaid Indemnity Interest) to the Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Sellers based on each Sellers Indemnity Seller Payment Transaction Percentage as set forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto (the " _Indemnity Seller Payment Transaction Percentage_ "); _provided_ , that the Escrow Agent shall retain in the remaining Indemnity Escrow Deposit an amount of Buyer Shares valued at the Agreed Upon Per Share Value, to the extent available, an amount equal to the sum of (A) any amount then payable to the Buyer under Section 2(b)(ii) and (B) any additional amount of Indemnification Losses claimed in good faith by the Buyer and disputed in good faith by the Sellers Representative in accordance with Section 2(b)(iii). 

   

 (c) This Agreement and the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall terminate when all amounts of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund, respectively, have been paid to the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, in accordance with Sections 2(a) and Section 2(b) of this Agreement.

Whenever this Agreement provides for a writing to be delivered by the Company, the Buyer or the Sellers Representative to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall only rely on a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, the Buyer or the Sellers Representative, respectively, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on an incumbency certificate from the Secretary of the Company, the Buyer or the Sellers Representative, as applicable, as evidence that the officer executing such writing on behalf of such party is an authorized officer of such party. 

   

 4\. Not later than ten (10) days after the end of each calendar month during the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company, the Buyer and Sellers Representative a statement reflecting the investment activity and month-end balance with respect to each of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund during the prior month. 

   

 5\.

All such fees and expenses paid under this paragraph shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6\. (a) All parties hereto acknowledge that the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are solely ministerial in nature and have been requested for their convenience. The Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be the agent of either/any party hereto, or to have any legal or beneficial interest in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, except as provided in the last sentence of Section 7 hereof. The parties hereto agree that the Escrow Agent (i) is a party to this Agreement only and has no duties or responsibilities in connection with, and shall not be charged with knowledge of, any agreements related hereto and (ii) shall not be liable for any act or omission taken or suffered in good faith with respect to this Agreement unless such act or omission is the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for punitive, consequential or incidental damages. 

   

 (b) The Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with its duties hereunder and shall be fully protected and incur no liability relative to any action or inaction taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of such legal counsel.

 (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any losses relative to the investment or liquidation of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, provided the Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund are each invested and held in accordance with Section 1 hereof. In addition,

entitled to break or cancel any investment to the extent reasonably necessary
or appropriate to make any payment required hereby, and shall not

failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 

   

 (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be required to institute legal proceedings of any kind.

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. 

   

 7\. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative (acting on behalf of the Sellers and the Optionholders), on the other hand, shall, on an equal basis, hold harmless and indemnify the Escrow Agent, its directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against all obligations, liabilities, claims, suits, judgments, losses, damages, costs or expenses of any kind or nature, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees, which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any of them in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agents duties hereunder, except to the extent arising from the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement. To the extent the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification, fees or expenses hereunder and such indemnification, fees or expenses are not timely paid, the parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall have, and hereby grant the Escrow Agent, a lien for the payment of such indemnification, expenses, or fees upon the Purchase Price Escrow Fund and the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

    ##### 

  

     

 8\. The Escrow Agent may resign as escrow agent at any time and be discharged of its duties hereunder after thirty (30) days notice to the Company, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative, but only if a successor escrow agent has been appointed by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative prior to the effective date of the Escrow Agents resignation. Upon receipt of notice of resignation, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative promptly shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to designate a successor escrow agent to serve in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative cannot agree on a successor escrow agent during such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to be solely a custodian to each of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, without further duties and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint (or to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint) a successor escrow agent to serve in accordance with the terms of this agreement. Upon receipt of a statement signed by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer directing the disposition of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund or both, to a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall comply promptly with that statement. Any successor escrow agent appointed by the Escrow Agent shall be a banking corporation or trust company having total assets in excess of $500,000,000, which shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof. Upon the appointment of a successor escrow agent by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative or by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow Agents duties and responsibilities under this Agreement shall terminate. If the Escrow Agent merges or consolidates with another entity, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another entity, the surviving entity or transferee, as applicable, shall be the successor Escrow Agent hereunder without any further action by the parties hereto. 

    ##### 

  

     

 9\. This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally and may be changed only with the written consent of the Company, the Buyer, the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent, which in the case of the Company and the Escrow Agent, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The Company is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and no Action has been instituted in any such jurisdiction revoking, limiting or curtailing or seeking to revoke, limit or curtail such power and authority or qualification. 

   

 (b) _Authorization; Enforcement_. Other than the Buyer Stockholder Approval (as such term is defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement), the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority, and has taken all requisite corporate action to enter into and to consummate the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents and otherwise to carry out its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Company and no further action is required by the Company in connection therewith, except for the Buyer Stockholder Approval. Each Transaction Document has been (or upon delivery will have been) duly executed by the Company and, when delivered in accordance with the terms hereof, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity. 

   

 (c) _No Conflicts_.

 (d) _Filings, Consents and Approvals_. Other than the Buyer Stockholder Approval, the Company is not required to obtain any consent, waiver, authorization or order of, give any notice to, or make any filing or registration with, any court or other federal, state, local or other governmental authority or other Person in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Transaction Documents, other than (i) the filing of Form D with the Commission and such filings required by state securities laws, which the Company will promptly and timely make, and (ii) such other filings as may be required following the Closing Date under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

As of their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, and the rules and regulations of any other Governmental Authority with which the SEC Reports were made or should have been made, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Reports comply in all material respects with the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved ("GAAP"), except as may be otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.

This Agreement has been 

   ##### 

  

   

duly executed by such Purchaser, and when delivered by such Purchaser in
accordance with terms hereof, will constitute the valid and legally
binding obligation of such Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (ii) as limited by equitable principles

 (d) _Experience of Such Purchaser._ Such Purchaser, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Shares, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. Such Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares and is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. Such Purchaser acknowledges that it is familiar with, and that the Company has made no statements, representations or warranties regarding, the assets and liabilities, the financial condition and prospects of CHS. 

   

 (e) _General Solicitation_. Such Purchaser is not purchasing the Shares as a result of any advertisement, article, notice or other communication regarding the Shares published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other general solicitation or general advertisement.

Such Purchaser acknowledges that it has reviewed the SEC Reports and has been afforded (i) the opportunity to ask such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Shares and the merits and risks of investing in the Shares; (ii) the opportunity to have access to information about the Company and its financial condition, results of operations, business, properties, management and prospects sufficient to enable it to evaluate its investment; and (iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional information that the Company possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the investment.

   ##### 

  

   

 (g) _Exemptions from Registration_. Such Purchaser understands that the Shares are being offered and will be sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States federal and state securities laws and that the Company is relying upon the truth and accuracy of, and the Purchasers compliance with, the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of the Purchaser to acquire such Shares. 

   

 (h) _No Governmental Approval_. Such Purchaser understands that no United States federal or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has passed on or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Shares or the fairness or suitability of the investment in the Shares by the Purchaser nor have such authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Shares. 

   

 (i) _Unregistered Shares._ Such Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered for sale, sold, assigned or transferred unless (i) subsequently registered thereunder or (ii) sold in reliance on an exemption therefrom.

ARTICLE IV 
 OTHER AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES 

   

 4.1 _Transfer._  

   

 (a) In connection with any transfer of the Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an Affiliate of a Purchaser, the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Shares under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of a Purchaser under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Certificates evidencing the Shares will contain the following legend, until such time as they are not required under Section 4.1(c): 

   

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER

THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN

ACQUISITION CORP., THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. 

   

 (c) Each Purchaser agrees that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates representing Shares as set forth in this Section 4.1 is predicated upon the Companys reliance that the Purchaser will sell any Shares pursuant to either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or an exemption therefrom. 

  

 4.2 _Furnishing of Information_. As long as any Purchaser owns the Shares, the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to 

   ##### 

  

   

be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act.
As long as any Purchaser owns Shares, if the Company is not required to file
reports pursuant to such laws, it will prepare and furnish to the Purchasers
and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) such information
as is required for the Purchasers to sell such Shares under Rule 144\. The
Company further covenants that it will take such further action as any
holder of Shares may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time
to time to enable such Person to sell such Shares without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule
144. 

  

 4.3 _Securities Laws Disclosure; Publicity_. By 8:30 a.m. (New York time) on the fourth Business Day following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall issue a press release reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers disclosing the transactions contemplated hereby and file a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Company will make such other filings and notices in the manner and time required by the Commission and the Trading Market on which the Common Stock is listed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company from selling Shares to additional purchasers, provided that, the Company shall make the filings and disclosures as required by this Section 4.3, to the extent required by law. 

  

 4.4 _Non-Public Information_. The Company covenants and agrees that, following the termination of the existing confidentiality agreements between the Company and the Purchasers, neither it nor any other Person acting on its behalf will provide any Purchaser or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company reasonably believes constitutes material non-public information, unless prior thereto such Purchaser shall have executed a written agreement regarding the confidentiality and use of such information. The Company understands and confirms that each Purchaser shall be relying on the foregoing representations in effecting transactions in securities of the Company. A definitive proxy statement will be delivered in connection with the CHS Transaction that will publicly disclose all of the material written information heretofore provided to the Purchasers by the Company with respect to the Company. 

  

 4.5 _Reservation of Stock_. As of the date hereof, the Company has reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to issue Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

The Registration Statement required hereunder shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the Shares on Form S-3, in which case the registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith). The Company expects to be eligible by April 4, 2008 to register for resale the Shares on Form S-3. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act (including the filing of any necessary amendments, post-effective amendments and supplements) until such date when all of the Shares (i) have been sold or (ii) may be sold free of volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, as determined by the counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and reasonably acceptable to the Companys transfer agent and the affected Purchasers. The Company shall as promptly as possible telephonically request effectiveness of the Registration Statement as of 5:00 pm Eastern Time on a Trading Day. The Company shall immediately notify the Purchasers via facsimile of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on the same Trading Day that the Company telephonically confirms effectiveness with the Commission, which shall be the date requested for effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company shall, by 5:30 pm Eastern Time on the Trading Day after the day the Commission declares the Registration Statement effective, file a Rule 424(b) prospectus with the Commission. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) The Company shall pay all expenses arising from or incident to its performance of, or compliance with, Section 4.7 of this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) Commission, stock exchange and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority registration and filing fees, (ii) all fees and expenses incurred in complying with securities or "blue sky" laws (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to any underwriter incurred in connection with "blue sky" qualifications of the Shares as may be set forth in any underwriting agreement), (iii) all printing, messenger and delivery expenses, (iv) the fees, charges and expenses of one counsel to the Purchasers not to exceed $25,000, any necessary counsel with respect to state securities law matters, counsel to the Company and of its independent public accountants, and any other accounting fees, charges and expenses incurred by the Company (including, without limitation, any expenses arising from any "cold comfort" letters or any special audits incident to or required by any registration or qualification) and any legal fees, charges and expenses incurred by the Purchasers, as the case may be, and (v) any liability insurance or other premiums for insurance obtained in connection with the registration contemplated by Section 4.7 of this Agreement, regardless of whether the Registration Statement is declared effective. All of the expenses described in the preceding sentence of this Section 7(d) are referred to herein as "Registration Expenses." 

   

 (c) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser and, to the extent such Purchaser is an entity, its partners, directors, officers, affiliates, stockholders, members, employees, trustees and each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) such Purchaser from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, or any action or proceeding in respect thereof (including reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (each, a "Liability" and collectively, "Liabilities"), arising out of or based upon (a) any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto; and (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading under the circumstances such statements were made; provided, however, that the Company shall not be held liable in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission contained in such Disclosure Package, Registration Statement, Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning such Purchaser furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Purchaser expressly for use therein. 

   

 (d) Any person or entity entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") after the receipt by the Indemnified Party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which the Indemnified Party intends to claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder (except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits substantive rights or defenses by reason of such failure). If notice of commencement of any such action is given to the Indemnifying Party as above provided, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the reasonable and documented out of pocket fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that either (x) representation of such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. In any of such cases, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such 

   ##### 

  

   

Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties
and all fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as incurred. No Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such Indemnified Party,
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of
which such Indemnified Party is a party and indemnity has been sought
hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability for
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. [Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested the
Indemnifying Party to reimburse the Indemnified Party for fees and expenses
of counsel as contemplated by this Section 9, the Indemnifying Party agrees
that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without the Indemnifying Partys written consent if (i) such settlement is
entered into more than thirty (30) business days after receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Party in accordance with such
request or contested the reasonableness of such fees and expenses prior to
the date of such settlement.] 

   

 (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4.7 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of any Liabilities referred to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which resulted in such Liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative faults of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.7(c) and (d), any reasonable and documented out of pocket legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding; provided, that the total amount to be contributed by any Purchaser shall be limited to the net proceeds received by such Purchaser in the offering. 

  

 4.8 _Lock-Up_. The Purchasers hereby irrevocably agree that following the Closing and for a period of 180 days from the Closing (the " _Lock-Up Period End Date_ "), the Purchasers will not, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of the Shares; 

   

 (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise; or 

   

 (3) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, for a period commencing on the date of the Closing and ending on the Lock-Up Period End Date; 

 

provided, that, the provisions of Section 4.8 shall not apply to (a) the
registration of the offer and sale of Common Stock and the sale of the Common
Stock in an offering as contemplated by Section 4.7 of this Agreement, (b)
bona fide gifts, provided the recipient thereof agrees in writing with the
Company to be bound by the terms of this Section 4.8, (c) in the case of any
Purchaser who is an individual, dispositions to a member of the immediate
family of such Purchaser, any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of
such Purchaser and/or the immediate family of such Purchaser (or a charitable
trust) or any entity all of whose interests are held by such Purchaser and/or
the immediate family of such Purchaser (or entities controlled by such
persons), provided that such trust or other entity agrees in writing with the
Company to be bound by the terms of this Section 4.8, (d) in the case of any
Purchaser who is an individual, dispositions to any beneficiary of
such Purchaser pursuant to a will or other testamentary document or 

    ##### 

  

    

applicable laws of descent, provided that such beneficiary agrees in writing
with the Company to be bound to the terms of this Section 4.8, (e)
transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired
in open market transactions after the Closing Date or (f) with the Companys
prior written consent. 

   

 4.9 _Form_ D. No later than ten (10) days after the Closing, the Company shall file a Form D with respect to the Shares as required under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and shall provide a copy thereof to each Purchaser promptly after filing.

Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (a) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified in this Section prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Trading Day, (b) the next Trading Day after the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number specified in this Section on a day that is not a Trading Day or later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on any Trading Day, (c) the Trading Day following the date of mailing, if sent by U.S. nationally recognized overnight courier service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be given.

  |   | Miami, Florida 33131  
  

  

  |   | Attn: Teddy Klinghoffer, Esq.  
  



  |   |   
  

If to a Purchaser: 

  |   | To the address set forth under such Purchasers name on the
signature pages hereof;  
   

  

or such other address as may be designated in writing hereafter, in the same
manner, by such Person. 

   

 5.5 _Amendments; Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by the Company and the Purchaser or Purchasers holding no less than a majority of the outstanding Shares; provided, however, that if any amendment or waiver adversely affects any Purchaser or 

   ##### 

  

 

Purchasers in a disproportionate manner, then the written consent of
any Purchaser so affected shall also be obtained. No waiver of any default
with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any
subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition
or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of either party to
exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such
right. 

   

 5.6 _Construction_. The headings herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. 

  

 5.7 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. The Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Purchasers. Any Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any Person to whom such Purchaser assigns or transfers any Shares, provided such transferee agrees in writing to be bound, with respect to the transferred Shares, by the provisions hereof that apply to the "Purchasers."

  

 5.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person, except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.8 (as to each Purchaser Party). 

  

 5.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws (without reference to choice or conflict of laws) of the State of New York. Each party hereby waives all right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding brought to enforce or defend any rights or remedies under this Agreement. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action, suit or proceeding by the delivery of such process to such party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 5.4. 

  

 5.10 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Shares. 

  

 5.11 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature page were an original thereof. 

  

 5.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt to agree upon a valid and enforceable provision that is a reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this Agreement. 

  

 5.13 _Replacement of Securities_. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement Shares. If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any Shares is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Company may require delivery of such mutilated certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance of a replacement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.14 _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

  

 5.15 _Independent Nature of Purchasers  Obligations and Rights_. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. The decision of each Purchaser to purchase Shares pursuant to the Transaction Documents has been made by such Purchaser independently of any other Purchaser. Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Document. Each Purchaser acknowledges that no other Purchaser has acted as agent for such Purchaser in connection with making its investment hereunder and that no Purchaser will be acting as agent of such Purchaser in connection with monitoring its investment in the Shares or enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.
