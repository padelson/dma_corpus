 **ARTICLE 3**

  

 ** **

  

 **WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT**

  

 ** **

  

3.1 _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Coventry shall
deliver to Buyer a statement showing the calculation of an estimate of the
FHS Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " ** _FHS
Estimated Working Capital_** "). The amount, if any, by which the FHS
Estimated Working Capital exceeds the FHS Target Working Capital is referred
to herein as the " ** _FHS Positive Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_**
", and the amount, if any, by which the FHS Target Working Capital exceeds
the FHS Estimated Working Capital is referred to herein as the " ** _FHS
Negative Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_**."

  



  

(b) Coventrys calculation of the FHS Estimated Working Capital as delivered
to Buyer shall be accompanied by such schedules and data as may be necessary
to support such calculation.

  



  

3.2 _Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall cause to be prepared and, as soon as practical, but in no
event later than 180 days after the Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered
to Coventry, the unaudited combined balance sheet of the Acquired Entities
prepared as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " ** _FHS Closing Date
Balance Sheet_** ") and a statement showing the calculation of the FHS
Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " ** _FHS Initial
Calculation_** "). The FHS Closing Date Balance Sheet and the FHS Initial
Calculation shall be accompanied by such schedules and data with respect to
the determination of the FHS Working Capital contained therein as may be
appropriate to support such FHS Initial Calculation.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Within 45 days after delivery to Coventry of the FHS Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the FHS Initial Calculation by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.2(a),
Coventry may deliver to Buyer a written notice (the " ** _Calculation
Notice_** ") either (A) advising Buyer that Coventry agrees with and accepts
the FHS Initial Calculation (as the case may be) or (B) setting forth those
particular line items (the " ** _Disputed Items_** ") in the FHS
Initial Calculation that Coventry disputes and a statement, with reasonable
detail as to the Disputed Items, of what Coventry believes is the correct
calculation of each Disputed Item and of the FHS Working Capital as of
immediately prior to the Closing. Coventry and the advisors engaged by
Coventry shall be entitled to review Buyers working papers, trial balances
and similar materials relating to its preparation of the FHS Closing Date
Balance Sheet for purposes of reviewing the FHS Initial Calculation. In
addition, Buyer shall also provide Coventry and its accountants with (i) the
reasonable assistance of personnel and (ii) timely and reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to its personnel, properties, books and
records, in each case at Buyers expense, but only to the extent related to
review by Coventry of such FHS Initial Calculation. If Coventry does not
submit a Calculation Notice within the 45-day period provided herein,
then the Initial Calculation shall become final, binding and conclusive on
the Parties and shall not be subject to further review, challenge
or adjustment. To the extent that Coventry timely provides a Calculation
Notice within the 45-day period, all items reflected therein that are not
Disputed Items shall become final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and
shall not be subject to further review, challenge or adjustment.

  



  

(c) Buyer and Coventry shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of 30 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) after the date
of Coventrys objection to the Calculation Notice to resolve any Disputed
Items.  During such 30-day period (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree), Buyer and Coventry shall have access to the working papers,
trial balances, schedules and calculations of the other used in the
preparation of the FHS Initial Calculation, the Calculation Notice and the
determination of the FHS Working Capital contained therein and the Disputed
Items. In the event that Buyer and Coventry are unable to resolve all
Disputed Items within such 30-day period (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree), then the remaining unresolved Disputed Items shall be
referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other nationally recognized
accounting firm selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Coventry (such
selected firm, the " ** _Settlement Firm_** "). Buyer and Coventry will
promptly, and in no event later than the time that Disputed Items are
submitted to the Settlement Firm, enter into reasonable and customary
arrangements for the services to be rendered by the Settlement Firm under
this Section 3.2(c). The Parties agree that the selection process for the
Settlement Firm shall occur only once and that such Settlement Firm, once
selected, shall resolve remaining unresolved Disputed Items. The determination
of the remaining unresolved Disputed Items by the Settlement Firm shall be
final, binding and conclusive and shall constitute an arbitral award that is
unappealable and not subject to further review, challenge or adjustment and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof.
 Buyer and Coventry shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Settlement Firm to reach a determination as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 30 days from the date

  



        
   

  



  

that the Disputed Items are submitted to it). Within 10 days after the
Settlement Firm has been retained, Buyer and Coventry shall furnish, at their
own expense, to the Settlement Firm and each other a written statement of
their position with respect to each Disputed Item. Within five Business Days
after the expiration of such 10-day period, Buyer and Coventry may deliver to
the Settlement Firm and to each other its response to the others position on
each Disputed Item.  With each submission, Buyer and Coventry may also
furnish to the Settlement Firm such information, workpapers and other
documents as they deem relevant to the resolution of the Disputed Items, with
appropriate copies or notification being given to the other.  In addition,
Buyer and Coventry shall each furnish the Settlement Firm such workpapers and
other documents and information relating to the Disputed Items, and shall
provide interviews and answer questions, as such Settlement Firm may
reasonably request. The Settlement Firm may, at its discretion, conduct a
conference concerning the disagreement with Buyer and Coventry, at which
conference Buyer and Coventry shall each have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present its advisors,
counsel and accountants. The fees, costs and expenses of the Settlement Firm
shall be allocated to and borne by Coventry and Buyer based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Settlement Firms determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the Disputed Items as originally
submitted to the Settlement Firm. For example, should the items in dispute
total in amount to $1,000 and the Settlement Firm awards $600 in favor of
Coventrys position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by Coventry.

  



  

(d) The " ** _FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount_** ", which may be a
positive or negative amount, shall mean the amount equal to the FHS Working
Capital, as finally determined in accordance with Sections 3.2(a), 3.2(b) and
3.2(c) (the " ** _Final FHS Working Capital_** "), minus the FHS Estimated
Working Capital. If the FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive
amount, then Buyer shall promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Coventry,
an amount equal to the FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together with
interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the rate
equal to the weighted average of the LIBOR for a one month period (the " **
_Closing Date Interest Rate_** "). If the FHS Working Capital Adjustment
Amount is a negative amount, then Coventry shall promptly deliver or cause
an Affiliate to promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to the
FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from
the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate.

  



  

(e) As soon as practicable after the beginning of the thirteenth month after
the Closing Date, the FHS Working Capital shall be re-calculated as of the
Closing Date, taking into account only post-Closing events through and
including the twelve months following the Closing Date as they relate to
customer accounts receivable that existed on the Closing Date and the
aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts with respect thereto (the " ** _Re-
Calculated FHS Working Capital_** "). Coventry shall cooperate

  



        
   

  



  

with Buyer in determining a mutually agreeable figure for the Re-Calculated
FHS Working Capital.  In the event of a disagreement between Coventry and
Buyer as to the FHS Working Capital as so re-calculated, the provisions of
Section 3.2(c) relating to the use of the Settlement Firm shall apply.  The
" ** _Re-Calculated FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount_** ," which may be
a positive or negative amount, shall mean the amount equal to the Re-
Calculated FHS Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with
Sections 3.2(c) and 3.2(e), minus the Final FHS Working Capital. If the Re-
Calculated FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a positive amount,
then Buyer shall promptly deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Coventry, an amount
equal to the Re-Calculated FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount, together
with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the
rate equal to Closing Date Interest Rate. If the Re-Calculated FHS Working
Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then Coventry shall promptly
deliver or cause an Affiliate to promptly deliver, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, an
amount equal to the Re-Calculated FHS Working Capital Adjustment Amount,
together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment
at the Closing Date Interest Rate.

  



  

(f) All amounts paid pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be deemed an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. For purposes of this Section 3.2,
all computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365
days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is
payable. Any payments made by any Person pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 10 Business
Days after the date on which the FHS Working Capital determinations become
final and binding on the Parties under this Section 3.2.

  



  

(g) The FHS Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section
3.2, shall be the final FHS Working Capital for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

3.3 _Methodology for Working Capital Calculations_. Section 3.3 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter sets forth certain agreed-upon exceptions to GAAP
applicable to the determination of the FHS Working Capital under this Article
III. All FHS Working Capital determinations made pursuant to this Article III
(estimated and actual), including each and every amount and calculation
determined in accordance therewith, shall be determined and calculated in
accordance with GAAP, as it exists on the date hereof, and as applied
consistently with the preparation of the FHS Financial Statements, except as
set forth on Section 3.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Section 3.3 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall set forth a sample calculation of the FHS
Working Capital calculated as of April 30, 2009.

of the Transactions will not, in and of itself, cause the revocation,

Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby. In the event Coventry or Buyer wishes to
destroy (or permit to be destroyed) such records after that time, such party
shall first give 90 days prior written notice to the other and such other

occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, change, condition or

the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if such
representation or warranty were made at such time, (ii) the failure of Buyer

shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each
party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist

use its reasonable best efforts to certify as soon as practicable their
substantial compliance with any requests for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and
Coventry shall as promptly as practicable comply with the Laws of any
other Governmental Authority that are applicable to any of the Transactions

is necessary, but in no event shall either Coventry or Buyer make any
necessary initial filings, notifications, reports, registrations or
declarations with any such Governmental Authority or take any initial action

to remove references concerning the valuation of the Acquired Assets or the
Shares and (ii) as necessary to comply with applicable Law or contractual
arrangements.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Consistent with Section 6.5(a), each of Buyer and Coventry agrees that it
will, if necessary to enable Coventry and Buyer to consummate the
Transactions, use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend against any
Action challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions
under the Antitrust Laws, including by seeking to vacate or reverse any
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other legal restraint
or prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other
Governmental Authority that is not yet final and nonappealable and by
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless,
by mutual agreement, Buyer and Coventry decide that litigation is not in
their respective best interests.

  



  

6.6 _Consents and Third Party Notices_.

  



  

(a) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Coventry shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain at the earliest practicable date
the Consents (except for such matters covered by Section 6.5), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that is required to be obtained

other and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable (subject to any applicable Law) to consummate the
Transactions as promptly as practicable. In addition, no Party shall take any
action after the date of this Agreement with the intent of materially
delaying the obtaining of, or not obtaining, any Consent from any
Governmental Authority necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

  



  

(b) At and after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all documents and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that
may be reasonably requested of it by another Party and are necessary or
appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for Coventry and Buyer, to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality

execute and deliver such instruments of assignment or transfer, and such
related notices, as may be or become necessary to effectuate or perfect the
transfer of any Acquired Asset to Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer and (ii)
take reasonable actions necessary to cause any telephone numbers that have
been made available to customers or

  



        
   

  



  

clients for use in the conduct of the Business to become available to Buyer
or a Subsidiary of Buyer for such use. In addition, in the event it is
determined that any Intellectual Property or Technology that has been used
primarily in the conduct of the Business in the ordinary course is not owned
by an Acquired Entity but such Intellectual Property or Technology is owned
by the Coventry Group, the Sellers will take all reasonable actions
necessary to grant to Buyer a perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-
exclusive, worldwide, license to use internally such Intellectual Property or
Technology for use in the conduct of the Business.

investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Acquired Assets and the Business, and Buyer has been
furnished with or given full access to such information about the Acquired
Assets and the Business as they requested. In connection with Buyers
investigation of the Acquired Assets and the Business, Buyer and its
representatives have received from the Sellers, or their respective
representatives, certain projections and other forecasts for the Business and
certain estimates, plans and budget information. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets, (ii) Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, and (iii) Buyer will not (and will cause all of its
respective Subsidiaries and other Affiliates and all other Persons acting on
their behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against Coventry or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their direct or indirect directors,
officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or representatives with respect to actual
results differing from the information reflecting such
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets, or hold any such other
Person liable with respect thereto.

  



  

(b) Buyer agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by
Sellers that are expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement, neither
Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates has made and shall not be
deemed to have made to Buyer, or to any of its respective representatives,
any representation or warranty of any kind.

  



  

6.9 _Indebtedness_.  Coventry shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities
to, immediately before the Closing, repay any FHS Outstanding Indebtedness
(or, earlier before the Closing do so in whole or in part, consistent with

Liens. In addition, Coventry shall make arrangements such that, at the
Closing, all expenses of the Acquired Entities relating to the Transactions,
including any investment banking or broker fees and expenses and any legal
expenses and filing fees, that have not already been paid shall be paid in
full so that the Acquired Entities shall have no liability therefor.

of the Seller Disclosure Letter is a list of the Guarantees and Letters of
Credit. The Parties

  



        
   

  



  

shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the
release, effective as of the Closing Date, of each and every member of the
Coventry Group that is a party to or bound by the Guarantees and Letters of
Credit, and (ii) cause to be issued, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, letters of credit, bankers acceptances and similar facilities
on Buyers account, to replace the Letters of Credit. In the event any of the
Guarantees or Letters of Credit are not released at the Closing, Buyer agrees
to indemnify and hold each member of the Coventry Group that is a party to
each such Guarantee or Letter of Credit harmless for any and all payments
required to be made under such Guarantee or Letter of Credit by such members
of the Coventry Group following the Closing until it is released for events
that occur following the Closing.

  



  

6.11 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_.  Except as provided in Section

Agreements shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and all
parties shall be released from all obligations thereunder, (b) all
Intercompany Payables shall terminate, all related notes shall be cancelled
and all FHS Outstanding Indebtedness thereunder shall be released and
forgiven, and (c) all Intercompany Receivables shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect and all outstanding obligations thereunder shall be
released and forgiven. Each Party shall, at the reasonable request of the
other Party, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall not apply to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

period of time beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until the date
that is two (2) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause the Acquired Entitles not to, amend the provisions of the CMS Group
Charter Documents relating to the indemnification of directors and officers
and advancement of expenses (the " ** _D andO Obligations_**") in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person that
is as of the date hereof an officer or director of any of the Acquired
Entities. The DandO Obligations of the Acquired Entities shall continue during
such period, _provided_ , _however_ , that any Loss incurred on account
thereof shall be a Buyer Indemnifiable Loss pursuant to Article XII.

  



  

6.13 _Audited Financial Statements_.  If Buyer reasonably determines that
Audited Financial Statements (as defined below) are required in order to
comply with its reporting obligations relating to the Transaction arising
under SEC Form 8-K, then at Buyers request, Coventry shall promptly (in no
event later than fifty (50) days following the later of the Closing or such
request) cause (i) an audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
auditing standards to be conducted by its regular independent auditor of a
combined balance sheet of the Acquired Entities and, to the extent required,
the Acquired Assets as at December 31, 2008 and related combined statements
of income of the Acquired Entities and, to the extent required, the Acquired
Assets for the year then ended (collectively, the " ** _Audited Financial
Statements_** "), and (ii) deliver to Buyer the Audited Financial Statements
including an unqualified audit report of Coventrys

  



        
   

  



  

independent auditor thereon. The Audited Financial Statements shall
be prepared in such form as shall be suitable for inclusion as an exhibit in
a Form 8-K Current Report (or a Form 10-Q Quarterly Report that may be filed
in lieu of Form 8-K Current Report) required to be filed by Buyer with the
SEC in connection with the acquisition of the Acquired Entities and the
Acquired Assets and Coventry shall cooperate with Buyer in preparing the pro
forma financial statements and any unaudited interim period financial
statements also required to be included as an exhibit thereto.  Coventry
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary written consent
of the auditor of the Audited Financial Statements for the inclusion of its
audit report on the Audited Financial Statements in such SEC filings by Buyer
for which such consent is required in order for such audit report to be
included in such filing (the " ** _Auditor s Consent_**"). The Buyer shall
reimburse Coventry for all fees, costs and expenses payable by Coventry or
its Affiliates to Coventrys independent registered public accounting firm in
connection with the preparation and audit of the Audited Financial
Statements.

  



  

6.14 _Transaction Agreements_.  At or prior to the Closing, Coventry shall
execute and deliver to Buyer, and cause each of its Subsidiaries that are to
be a party thereto to execute and deliver to Buyer, the Transaction
Agreements to which such Person is to be a party and that have not previously
been executed and delivered by it.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 7**

  

 ** **

  

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

 ** **

  

7.1 _WARN_. Each of the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, at any time within the 90-day period prior to the Closing,
effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in
WARN or any state or local Law, affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the Business, including
Eligible Employees, without notifying Buyer in advance and without complying
with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN and any state
or local Law.

  



  

7.2 _Employee Matters and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Offers of Employment or Engagement_.  On or before the Closing Date,
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Entities
to, immediately following the Closing Date offer employment to any Eligible
Employees who were employed by CMS immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Such employment shall be at base annual salaries or hourly wage rate
substantially comparable to the annual base salaries or hourly wage rate of
such Eligible Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any Eligible Employees.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(i) Buyer shall take any and all such action as may be necessary so that, on
and after the Closing Date, Eligible Employees who after the Closing are
employed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (" ** _Hired Employees_** ")
participate, as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing Date,
in the employee benefits of the Buyer or its Affiliates, to the extent
permitted under the terms of such plans or applicable Law, provided, that
Buyer shall have the right to designate that Hired Employees participate in
one or more of Buyers health plans. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as requiring Buyer or any of its Affiliates to entitle the Hired
Employees to participate in all the Buyers employee benefit plans
in existence as of the Closing Date or to continue any specific employee
benefit plan for any Hired Employees. As of the Closing Date, each Acquired
Entity shall cease to be a participating company in the Employee Plans, each
such Hired Employees shall cease to be eligible to participate in the
Employee Plans and no further benefits shall accrue under such Employee Plans
with respect to any such Hired Employees or any beneficiary of any such Hired
Employees (other than any such beneficiary receiving health coverage under
COBRA). Sellers shall be responsible for any administrative costs related to
the termination of the Hired Employees participation in the Employee Plans.
All contributions accrued by the Hired Employees under the Sellers 401(k)
plan with respect to all employer contributions, including employee
deferrals, matching contributions (including any true-up contributions, if
applicable), profit-sharing contributions, employer non-elective
contributions, and Seller share contributions for the Hired Employees through
the Closing Date, determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Sellers 401(k) plan, ERISA and the Code, and based on all service
performed and compensation accrued prior to the Closing Date, shall be
deposited by the Sellers to the Sellers 401(k) plan as soon as
administratively feasible following the Closing Date. On or after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall be responsible for any costs of participation and provision
of administrative services related to the Hired Employees in Buyers employee
benefit plans.

  



  

(ii) For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in all benefits
provided by Buyer to such Hired Employees, each Hired Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the applicable Seller or
Affiliate to the same extent as such Hired Employee was entitled, before the
Closing Date, to credit for such service under any corresponding Employee
Plans, except for any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or any plan, program
or policy providing retiree health or life benefits, or except to the extent
that it would result in a duplication of benefits. The eligibility of any
such Hired Employee to participate in any welfare benefit plan or program of
Buyer shall not be subject to any exclusion for any pre-existing conditions
if such individual has met the participation requirements of similar benefit
plans and programs of the applicable Seller or Affiliate.  All individuals
eligible to participate in any plan or arrangement

  



        
   

  



  

contemplated above shall be immediately eligible to participate in the
similar plan or arrangement maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates.  Amounts
paid before the Closing Date by a Hired Employee under any health plans of
Sellers or their Affiliates shall, after the Closing Date, be taken into
account in applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the
health plans of Buyer provided as of the Closing Date to the same extent as
if such amounts had been paid by such Hired Employee under such health plans
of Buyer.

  



  

(iii) To the extent practicable, Buyer will cause Buyers 401(k) Plan to
accept a direct rollover of, or an eligible rollover of, all or a portion of
the taxable portion of a distribution of an Eligible Employees account
balance from Sellers 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
not assume, and shall be deemed not to have assumed, any liabilities arising
out of, relating to or with respect to (i) the employment or performance of
services, or termination of employment or services by CMS of any current or
former employees or directors of CMS on or before the Closing Date (including
without limitation, wages or other compensation, and plans, agreements or
arrangements providing for bonus, incentive compensation, vacation, sick
days, personal days, severance benefits, or other employee benefits), (ii)
workers compensation claims against any of the Sellers except against the
Acquired Entities, irrespective of whether such claims are made prior to or
after the Closing, or (iii) any Employee Plan.

  



  

(v) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all payroll, payroll taxes,
employer taxes and withholdings (including without limitation federal and
state employee withholding taxes, employer taxes and employer and employee
FICA) that are required to be paid or withheld through the Closing Date shall
be paid by Sellers. Sellers shall pay all accrued but unused vacation through
the Closing Date, _provided_ , that up to a maximum of five (5) days per
Hired Employee shall not be paid by Sellers and shall be included in accrued
liabilities, and thus in the FHS Working Capital, to the extent that each
such Hired Employee has five (5) days of accrued but unused vacation
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

7.3 _Covenants Not to Compete_.

  



  

(a) Except as described in Section 7.3(b), during the period of time
beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until four (4) years after the
Closing Date, each Seller covenants and agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Affiliates and representatives (on behalf of a Seller) not to,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, own,
manage, engage in, operate, control, maintain any interest in (proprietary,
financial or otherwise) or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, any business within the Designated Area in the
business of

  



        
   

  



  

pharmacy administration services to state "fee-for-service" Medicaid programs
(the " ** _FHS Restricted Business_** ").

  



  

(b) Nothing contained herein shall limit the right of any Seller, its
representatives (on behalf of a Seller) or its Affiliates to:

  



  

(i) Provide pharmacy services to state Medicaid or other entitlement programs
as part of a managed care contract;

  



  

(ii) Purchase or Acquire any entity or substantially all of the assets of any
entity that generates less than 15% of its revenue from the FHS Restricted
Business; or

  



  

(iii) Maintain any ownership interest of five percent (5%) or less of the
outstanding common stock of any publicly traded corporation.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall
not apply to Coventry in the event of a Change in Control.

  



  

7.4 [Reserved]

  



  

7.5 [Reserved]

  



  

7.6 _Confidential Nature of Information_.  Each of Buyer and each Seller and
their respective Affiliates shall treat in confidence all documents,
materials and other information, whether written or oral, which it shall have
obtained regarding the other parties during the course of the negotiations
leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
obtained before or after the Effective Date), the investigation provided for
herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related documents,
and, in the event the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be
consummated, each party will return to the other party all copies of
nonpublic documents and materials which have been furnished in connection
therewith. Such documents, materials and information shall not be
communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of Buyer, to its
counsel, accountants, financial advisors or lenders, and in the case of
Sellers, to their counsel, accountants or financial advisors). No Person
shall use any confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely
for the purpose of evaluating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the negotiation or enforcement of this Agreement or any agreement
contemplated hereby. The obligation of each party to treat such documents,
materials and other information in confidence shall not apply to
any information which (i) is or becomes lawfully available to such party from
a source other than the furnishing party; (ii) is or becomes available to
the public other than as a result of disclosure by such party or its agents;
or (iii) is required to be disclosed under applicable laws, but only to the
extent it must be disclosed.

  



        

  



  

7.7 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) On and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Coventry
agrees that it shall not invite, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the
making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to any direct
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, or other disposition of any material amount of the
assets of the Acquired Entities or any capital stock or other ownership
interests of the Acquired Entities in one transaction or a series of related
transactions (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** "), or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with or provide any confidential or non-public information or
data to, or afford access to properties, books or records to, any Person
relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to agree
to do any of the foregoing, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to
make or implement an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit any officer, director, employee or agent of Coventry
or its Affiliates from inviting, initiating, soliciting or encouraging,
directly or indirectly, any inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations
or the making or implementation of any proposal for the acquisition (whether
through merger, share exchange, purchase or otherwise) of Coventry or
substantially all of the assets of Coventry.

  



  

7.8 _Release for Pre-closing Intercompany Liabilities_. The Coventry Group
shall execute and deliver to Buyer effective as of the Closing Date, a
release substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " **
_CMS Group Release_** ") releasing the Acquired Entities from any and all
liabilities to the Coventry Group arising prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

7.9 _Securities_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell or
liquidate before the Closing any and all long term securities by the Acquired
Entities. In the event that any such securities have not been sold or
liquidated previously (the " ** _Unsold Securities_** "), Coventry shall
purchase, or shall cause its Affiliates to purchase, the Unsold Securities at
their fair market value within two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 8**

  



  

 **TAX MATTERS**

  

 ** **

  

8.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnification_.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
12.3(c)(ii) with respect to Buyer Indemnifiable Losses, Sellers shall jointly
and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any Losses

  



        
   

  



  

that Buyer Indemnitees may suffer, sustain or become subject to arising out
of, in connection with or resulting from (i) any Taxes of the Acquired
Entities or with respect to the Acquired Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the portion of any Taxes of the Acquired Entities or with respect
to the Acquired Assets for any Straddle Period that is allocable (determined
in accordance with Section 8.1(c)) to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, (ii) any Taxes arising by reason of any of the
Acquired Entities being a member of any Consolidated Group on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6(a) (or any predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or
similar provision of Law), (iii) without duplication, the failure of any of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 to be true and
correct in all respects (determined without regard to any qualifications
related to materiality contained therein) or the failure to perform any
covenant contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes, and (iv) any
failure by Coventry to timely pay its portion of Transfer Taxes pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Coventry shall not be
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, and Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees, from any Taxes to the extent resulting
from any action taken by Buyer or the Acquired Entities after the Closing and
on the Closing Date outside of the ordinary course of business.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns and Taxes of Acquired Entities_.

  



  

(i) Coventry shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all
Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and shall pay all Taxes due with respect thereto. With respect to
such Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date (other than with
respect to the Tax Returns of the Consolidated Group for which Coventry is
the common parent), Coventry shall provide, at least 35 days prior to filing
such Tax Return, a copy of such Tax Return, together with all workpapers and
schedules utilized in its preparation, to Buyer for its review, comment and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices, except
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Within 10 days after delivery by
Coventry of a copy of such Tax Returns, Buyer shall deliver to Coventry a
written notice (the " ** _Tax Return Notice_** ") either (A) advising
Coventry that Buyer agrees with and accepts such Tax Returns (in which event
Buyer shall sign and timely file such Tax Returns and Coventry shall timely
pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns to the appropriate Tax
Authorities), or (B) advising Coventry that Buyer disputes such Tax Returns
(in which event Buyer and Coventry shall use commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of 10 days after the receipt of the Tax Return Notice by
Coventry to resolve any dispute relating to such Tax Returns). If the Parties
cannot in good faith resolve such dispute within such 10 day period, Buyer
shall refer the dispute relating to such Tax Returns to Deloitte and Touche
LLP or such other nationally recognized accounting firm that is reasonably
acceptable to Coventry (the " ** _Tax Settlement Firm_ "**). Buyer shall be
required to sign such Tax Returns only if Buyer is advised in writing by the
Tax Settlement Firm that the filing of such Tax

  



        
   

  



  

Returns would not subject the applicable Acquired Entity to Tax penalties
excluding late filing penalties.  The fees, costs and expenses of the Tax
Settlement Firm shall be borne by Buyer.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns with respect
to the Acquired Entities for all Straddle Periods. With respect to each such
Tax Return for a Straddle Period, (A) Buyer shall provide, at least 30 days
prior to filing such Tax Return, a copy of such Tax Return, together with
all workpapers and schedules utilized in its preparation, to Coventry for
its review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), along with a statement of the amount due from Sellers
with respect to such Tax Returns determined in a manner consistent with
Section 8.1(c), and (B) such Tax Return shall be prepared as required by
applicable Law and in a manner consistent with Section 8.1(c) and with past
practices, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer shall pay
all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, provided, however,
that Coventry shall pay to Buyer the amount of Taxes which relate to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof and set forth on the statement.  After the
Closing, neither Buyer nor any of the Acquired Entities shall, without the
prior written consent of Coventry, file any amended Tax Return with respect
to any Acquired Entity for any Taxable period beginning on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes of Acquired Entities_. For purposes
of allocating Taxes and preparing Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for a
Straddle Period, the portion of any Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a
Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be:

  



  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year or period
ended on the Closing Date;

  



  

(ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) above that are
imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire relevant period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for
the immediate preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
relevant period; and

  



  

(iii) for purposes of determining such Taxes, exemptions, relief, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction
for depreciation, shall be apportioned in the manner specified in
subparagraph (ii) above.  All determinations necessary to give effect to the

  



        
   

  



  

foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the applicable Acquired Entity.

  



  

(d) _Tax Refunds of the Acquired Companies_.  The amount or economic benefit
of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Acquired Entities for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Coventry. The amount
or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the
Acquired Entities for any Taxable period beginning on or after the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of
any refund, credit or offset of Taxes of the Acquired Entities for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Coventry and Buyer in
accordance with the principles set forth in Section 8.1(c). Each Party shall
forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party entitled to
receive the amount or economic benefit (net of any Taxes payable with respect
thereto) of a refund, credit or offset to Tax pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)
the amount of such refund or economic benefit within 30 days after such
refund is received or such credit or offset is allowed or applied against
another Tax liability, as the case may be.

  



  

(e) _Carrybacks_. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall not carryback any net operating loss, capital loss, tax
credit or other tax attribute of any of the Acquired Entities arising in any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Buyer or its Affiliates may carryback any net operating loss, capital loss,
tax credit or other tax attribute of any of the Acquired Entities arising in
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Period
only if (a) there is no election under applicable Law to waive such carryback
and (b) a failure to carryback would result in Buyer or its Affiliates
permanently losing the economic benefit associated with any such net
operating loss, capital loss, tax credit or other tax attribute. If, at
Buyers request, any such net operating loss, capital loss, tax credit or
other tax attribute is carried back as set forth herein (x) Coventry will
cooperate with the Acquired Entities in obtaining such refund (or reduction
or benefit), including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund
claims, and (y) Coventry shall pay to Buyer any Tax refund (or reduction in
Tax liability or other Tax benefit) resulting from a carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss, tax credit or other tax attribute of any of the
Acquired Entities arising in any taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, when such refund (or reduction or benefit)
is realized by Coventry, net of the reasonable costs incurred by Coventry to
secure such refund (or reduction or benefit), including, without limitation,
costs related to the utilization of employees of Coventry or its Affiliates.

  



  

8.2 _Transfer Taxes and Property Taxes on Acquired Assets_.

  



  

(a) _Transfer Taxes_.  All sales, use, transfer, real property transfer,
value added, recording, _registration_ , notary, stamp, stamp duty or similar
Taxes and fees, and all recording costs, arising out of the transfer of the
Acquired Assets and the Shares pursuant to this Agreement and all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the transferring and recording of title
to the Acquired Assets (collectively, the " ** _Transfer Taxes_** "), shall
be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Coventry. The Tax Returns relating

  



        
   

  



  

to such Transfer Taxes shall be timely prepared by the Party legally
obligated to make such filing, and such Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other Parties at least
10 days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b) _Property Taxes_.

  



  

(i) All ad valorem Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar obligations
attributable to the Acquired Assets with respect to the Tax period in which
the Closing Date occurs (" ** _Property Taxes_** ") shall be apportioned as
of the Closing Date among Coventry and Buyer determined by prorating
such Property Taxes on a daily basis over the entire Taxable period.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, when due, to the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all Property Taxes relating to the Taxable period during which
the Closing Date occurs. Buyer shall send to Coventry a statement
that apportions the Property Taxes as of the Closing Date between Coventry
and Buyer based upon Property Taxes actually invoiced and paid to the Taxing
Authorities by Buyer for the Tax year which includes the Closing Date. Within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of such statement, Coventry shall reimburse
Buyer for Coventrys pro-rated portion of such Property Taxes to the extent
the aggregate amount of such Property Taxes pro-rated to Coventry exceeds the
amount of Property Taxes included as a current liability in the FHS Working
Capital, as finally determined in accordance with Article III.

  



  

8.3 _Tax Claims; Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Control of Tax Claims_.  Buyer shall promptly notify Coventry upon
receipt of any notice of any Tax audit, assessment, claim or investigation
relating to the Acquired Entities or the Acquired Assets for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period (a " ** _Tax Claim_** ") for which Sellers and
their Affiliates may be liable, _provided_ , _however_ , no failure or
delay by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to provide notice of a Tax Claim
shall reduce, release, waive, or otherwise affect the obligation of Sellers
or their Affiliates hereunder except to the extent that such failure or delay
has materially and adversely affected the right of Seller or its Affiliates
to participate in and contest the Tax Claim.  Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, with respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes
for which Sellers or their Affiliates may be liable, Coventry shall control
all proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that Coventry will allow Buyer to
participate at its own expense in the defense of any such Tax Claim (other
than a Tax Claim relating to a Tax or Tax Return of the Consolidated Group of
which Coventry is the common parent or the Consolidated Group in which First
Health Services Corporation was included prior to its acquisition by
Coventry); _provided_ _further_ that Coventry shall not enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to such proceeding without
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
to the extent that such compromise or settlement may adversely affect Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) after the Closing Date.
With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period and involving
both Taxes for which either Sellers or any of

  



        
   

  



  

their Affiliates are liable and Taxes for which neither Sellers nor their
Affiliates are liable, Coventry and Buyer shall jointly control the defense
of such Tax Claim and neither Coventry nor Buyer shall enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to such proceeding without
prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(b) _Cooperation_.  The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Parties in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date and any audit, litigation, or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are relevant to the filing of any Tax Return or any filing
with the SEC (including, without limitation, information regarding tax basis
and other attributes) or any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities and Acquired Assets relating
to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

  



  

(c) _Mitigation_. The Parties further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but
not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

8.4 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_.  Any and all Tax allocation or
Tax sharing agreements or other similar agreements or arrangements with any
of the Acquired Entities, whether or not written, shall be terminated with
respect to the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, the Acquired Entities shall not be obligated to make any
payment to any Person pursuant to any such agreement or arrangement for any
past or future period.

  



  

8.5 _Election_. Unless Buyer provided written consent to the contrary, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers and
their Affiliates shall not make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) or (C) to reattribute any portion of any tax attributes
of the Acquired Entities to Sellers or its Affiliates.

  



  

8.6 _Tax Treatment of Payments_.  The Parties shall treat any payments made
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal
Tax purposes, unless a final determination causes such payment not to be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes.

  



  

8.7 _Exclusivity; Survival_.  The provisions of Article XII other than
Sections 12.3(c)(ii), 12.3(g) and 12.5 shall not apply with respect to the
obligations of Sellers

  



        
   

  



  

concerning Taxes and the provisions of this Article VIII (subject to Section
12.3(c)(ii)) shall be the exclusive source of the rights of the parties with
respect to matters concerning Taxes. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of the limitations on indemnification in Section 12.3
(other than in Section 12.3(c)(ii)) shall apply with respect to
indemnification under this Article VIII. The provisions of Section 8.1(a)
shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions or
waivers thereof), except as to Section 8.1(a)(iii) for breaches of the
representations and warranties in Section 4.10, which shall survive until the
expiration of the statute of limitations. The remaining provisions of this
Article VIII shall survive the Closing Date in accordance with their terms.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 9 
  
 CLOSING**

  

 ** **

  

9.1 _Time and Place of Closing_.  Unless otherwise agreed to by Coventry and
Buyer, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " **
_Closing_** ") will occur at 9:00 a.m. local time on the second Business Day
following the day on which all conditions to Closing (other than conditions
the fulfillment of which is to occur at the Closing) are satisfied or waived.
The Closing shall take place at the offices of Bass, Berry and Sims PLC in

 **ARTICLE 11**

  



  

 **TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

  

 ** **

  

11.1 _Termination_.  This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be terminated prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Coventry, duly authorized by each
of their respective Boards of Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof);

  



  

(b) by Buyer if there shall have been any breach by Sellers of any
representation or warranty (or if any of the representations or warranties of
Sellers set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct), or if
the Sellers have breached or failed to perform or adhere to any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition to
the Closing set forth in Section 10.2(a) or (b) hereunder in favor of Buyer
and (ii) cannot be cured, or has not been cured within 30 days (the " **
_Cure Period_** "; for purposes of clarification, if the failure of a
condition to Closing cannot be cured, the applicable Cure Period is zero
days), following receipt by Coventry of written notice, of such breach or
failure;

  



  

(c) by Sellers if there shall have been any breach by Buyer of any
representation or warranty (or if any of the representations or warranties of
Sellers set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct), or if
Buyer has breached or failed to perform or adhere to any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, in each case which breach (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition to the Closing set forth in Section
10.3(a) or (b) hereunder in favor of Sellers and (ii) has not been cured
within the Cure Period, following receipt by Buyer of written notice of such
breach;

  



  

(d) by Buyer, if after the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred
any events or changes in circumstances or states of fact that have resulted
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Business;

  



  

(e) by either Buyer or Sellers:

  



  

(i) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before November 30, 2009
(the " ** _Termination Date_** ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) if a
Cure Period has not expired prior to such date, then Sellers shall have the
right to extend the Termination Date to the first Business Day after the last
day of such Cure Period, and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(e)(i) shall not be available to any Party whose
breach of this Agreement at or prior to the Termination Date has been a cause
of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date; or

  



  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 10.1(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable or if any Restraint
resulting from any judicial or administrative injunction, judgment, order or
any arbitration award is in effect and, although such injunction, judgment,
order or award is subject to appeal or review and, as a result, to being
reversed, over-ruled, dissolved or revoked, in the good faith judgment of
Coventry or Buyer, as the case may be, such reversal, over-ruling,
dissolution or revocation cannot reasonably be expected to occur before the
Termination Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 11.1(e)(ii) shall not be available to a party if
such Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Any termination pursuant to this Section 11.1 (other than a termination
pursuant to clause (a) hereof) shall be effected by written notice from the
Party so terminating to the other Parties, which notice shall specify the
Section hereof pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated.

  



        
   

  



  

11.2 _Effect of Termination_.  In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and of no further force or effect with no liability or obligation
hereunder on the part of any Party or their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees or stockholders, except Section 13.1 (Public
Announcements), Section 7.6 (Confidential Nature of Information),
Section 6.13 (Audited Financial Statements, as it relates to Buyers
obligation to reimburse Coventry for all audit fees, costs and expenses),
Article XI and Article XIII shall survive such termination and the liability
of any Party for any willful breach by such Party of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement
occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the non-breaching Party shall be entitled
to pursue any and all legally available remedies and to seek the recovery of
all losses, liabilities, damages costs and expenses of every kind and nature
(including reasonable attorneys fees).

by a third party that, if true, would constitute a breach of such

Article XII after the expiration of the above survival period shall
terminate.

  



  

(b) All covenants and agreements made by the parties to this Agreement that
contemplate performance following the Closing Date shall survive the Closing
Date in accordance with their terms. All covenants and agreements that
contemplate performance prior to the Closing Date shall not survive the
Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such covenant or
agreement is breached on or prior to the Closing Date, the non-breaching
party shall retain all rights and remedies hereunder with respect to such
breach following the Closing Date.

  



        
   

  



  

12.2 _Indemnification by the Parties_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Sellers_.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article XII, Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Acquired Entities (all
such persons, collectively, the " ** _Buyer Indemnitees_** ") from
and against any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising out of, in connection with
or resulting from:

  



  

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by

certificate delivered pursuant to Section 10.2(a) of this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to

(iv) any payment made by an Acquired Entity, as contemplated by Section 6.12;

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_.  Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article XII, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Coventry and its
Affiliates (all such Persons, collectively, the " ** _Seller Indemnitees_**
") from and against any Losses the Seller Indemnitees may suffer, sustain
or become subject to (" ** _Seller Indemnifiable Losses_** "; Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses and Seller Indemnifiable Losses, as the context
requires, are sometimes referred to herein as " ** _Indemnifiable Losses_**
"), arising out of, in connection with or resulting from:

  



  

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made by Buyer
under Article V or any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 10.3(a);

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to

(iii) any financial advisory, brokers, finders or similar fee, commission,
reimbursement of expenses, indemnification or contribution payable as a
result of any agreement, act or statement by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Transaction.

  



  

(c) _Indemnified Parties and Indemnifying Parties_. As the context requires,
a Buyer Indemnitee when entitled to indemnity hereunder and a Seller
Indemnitee when entitled to indemnity hereunder is sometimes referred to
herein as an " ** _Indemnified Party_** " and a Seller when required to
provide indemnity hereunder and the Buyer when required to provide indemnity
hereunder is sometimes referred to herein as the " ** _Indemnifying
Party_**."

  



  

12.3 _Limits on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with
respect to any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 12.2(a) until
Buyer Indemnitees shall first have suffered aggregate Buyer Indemnifiable
Losses in excess of $500,000 (the " ** _Deductible_** ") (at which
point, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XII, Sellers
shall only be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for all such Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that such Losses are in excess of the
Deductible); _provided_ , the Deductible limitation shall not apply to Buyer
Indemnifiable Losses arising (i) out of a breach of any Fundamental
Representation, (ii) under Article VIII (Tax Matters), (iii) under Section
6.12 (Post-closing Indemnification of Directors and Officers) or (iv) under
Section 12.2(a)(v).

  



  

(b) Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify Seller Indemnitees with
respect to any Seller Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 12.2(b)
until Seller Indemnitees shall first have suffered aggregate Seller
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Deductible (at which point, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article XII, Buyer shall only be obligated
to indemnify Seller Indemnitees for all such Seller Indemnifiable Losses to
the extent that such Losses are in excess of the Deductible); provided, the
Deductible limitation shall not apply to Seller Indemnifiable Losses arising
(i) out of a breach of Section 6.10 or (ii) under Article VIII (Tax Matters).

  



  

(c) (i) Other than Losses arising out of a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or Losses arising under Article VIII (Tax Matters), the
aggregate liability of Sellers for Buyer Indemnifiable Losses arising
under Section 12.2 shall not exceed $15,000,000 (the " ** _Cap_** ").

  



  

(ii) Sellers aggregate liability for all Buyer Indemnifiable Losses shall
not in any case exceed the Purchase Price, except that any Buyer

  



        
   

  



  

Indemnifiable Losses to which Buyer is entitled to indemnity pursuant to
Section 8.1(a)(ii) shall be excluded for purposes of applying such
limitation.

  



  

(iii) Other than Losses arising out of a breach of Section 6.10 or under
Article VIII (Tax Matters), Buyers aggregate liability for all
Seller Indemnifiable Losses arising under Section 12.2(b) shall not exceed
the Cap. In no event shall Buyers aggregate liability for all Seller
Indemnifiable Losses exceed the Purchase Price.

  



  

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder, after a breach or failure
by the Sellers referred to in Section 12.2(a)(i) or by Buyer referred to in
Section 12.2(b)(i) has been established, any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties shall be ignored
for purposes of determining the amount of the Loss.

  



  

(e) The Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize
the Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article XII or Article VIII to the
extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this Article XII are not intended to provide a Party
(or its Affiliates), in connection with a claim hereunder for indemnification
by such Party (or its Affiliates) in respect to a breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant hereunder by another Party, indemnity against damages
resulting from the breach to the extent the damages were not reasonably
foreseeable to result from such breach; it being understood and agreed that
indemnity shall be accorded in accordance with this Article XII against
Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party as a result of a Third Party Claim
even if, and to the extent, such Losses include an award of damages to
a third party that were not reasonably foreseeable. It is understood and
agreed that it is reasonably foreseeable that a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.14 (Material Contracts) or Section 4.23
(Customers and Suppliers) or the giving or a failure to give notification
relating thereto, required by Coventry under Section 6.4(a)(i) may result in
a Loss of Profits by an Acquired Entity and, to the extent an Acquired Entity
sustains a Loss of Profits as a result of such a breach, indemnity against
such Loss shall be accorded in accordance with (and subject to the
limitations provided by) this Article XII (in addition to indemnity against
other forms of Losses sustained). For purposes hereof, " ** _Loss
of Profits_** " means lost revenue to the Business from a customer contract
(net of expenses, including Taxes, that would have been incurred to realize
such lost revenue) resulting from the breach of a representation or warranty
set forth on Section 4.14 (Material Contracts) or Section 4.23 (Customers and
Suppliers) or the giving or the failure to give a notification relating
thereto required by Section 6.4(a)(i).

  



  

(g) THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE XII AND IN ARTICLE VIII
SHALL BE AN INDEMNIFIED PARTYS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT FOR LOSSES ARISING
FROM OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY WILLFUL BREACH OR FRAUD. Each Indemnified

  



        
   

  



  

Party waives all other rights and claims that such Person may otherwise have,
whether in Law or in equity, relating in any way to a breach of this
Agreement, including claims for contribution, breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent or intentional misrepresentation or
breach of duty.

  



  

(h) The Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to this Article XII or
Article VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes,
unless a final determination causes such payment not to be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal Tax purposes.

  



  

(i) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any amounts under
this Article XII to the extent included as a current liability or current
reserve on the FHS Closing Date Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant
to Section 3.2.

  



  

12.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

  



  

(a) If any third party shall notify any Indemnified Party with respect to any
matter (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this Article XII, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure to so notify an
Indemnifying Party shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to
indemnity hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
by such failure.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided by Article VIII with respect to a proceeding
with respect to a Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which Sellers or their
Affiliates may be liable and subject to Section 12.4(d), the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party, within 15 days after the Indemnified Party
has given notice of the Third Party Claim, that the Indemnifying Party is
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in an active and diligent
manner. In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim within 15 days after receipt of notice of the Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the
defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense and for the account of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article XII.

  



  

(c) So long as the conditions set forth in Section 12.4(b) are and remain
satisfied, then (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 12.4(b), (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense to
represent it in connection with the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate, and cause the counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with such co-counsel in connection with the
response, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim and any related
suit or proceeding and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
prior written consent of

  



        
   

  



  

the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect
to the matter, or enter into any settlement which (A) imposes an injunction
or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or (B) does not include
an unconditional provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to
such matter.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.4 to the contrary, Sellers
shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Acquired Entities,
in respect of which the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be entitled to
indemnity in accordance with this Article XII if such Third Party Claim (i)
involves as a claimant a client or customer or supplier listed in
Section 4.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii) is a criminal
investigation or proceeding or (iii) involves any other investigation or
inquiry by any Governmental Authority. In each such case, the Buyer (on its
own behalf or on behalf of any other Buyer Indemnitees if such claim,
assertion, action or proceeding involves another Buyer Indemnitee) shall
direct, through counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers, the response to, defense of or settlement of any such claim,
assertion, investigation, inquiry, action or proceeding, but the cost thereof
and any other Loss resulting therefrom shall be a Buyer Indemnifiable Loss in
accordance with the Article XII. The Buyer Indemnitee shall not,
however, without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any such matter or enter into any settlement thereof
if Sellers are required to provide indemnity hereunder with respect to any
Loss resulting from such judgment or settlement. Buyer shall consult with
Sellers for the purpose of allowing Sellers to participate in the response,
defense or settlement of any such claim, assertion, investigation, inquiry,
action or proceeding, but in such case, the expenses of Sellers, including
the fees and disbursements of its counsel, shall be paid by Sellers. If
Sellers shall determine to be represented by counsel in connection with any
such claim, assertion, investigation, inquiry action or proceeding, the Buyer
Indemnitee shall cooperate, and cause the counsel representing it in such
proceeding to cooperate, with counsel representing Sellers in such proceeding
and Buyer shall provide and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide (during
normal business hours) Sellers and their counsel with reasonable access to
the records and personnel of the Acquired Entities and Buyer relating to any
such claim, assertion, investigation, inquiry, action or proceeding as to
which Sellers may be required to provide indemnity hereunder to the extent
reasonable for Sellers to participate in the response, defense or settlement
thereof.

  



  

12.5 _Indemnification Notices_.

  



  

(a) In order to obtain indemnity in respect of a Loss as provided by Section
12.2 or under Article VIII, an Indemnified Party shall give an " **
_Indemnification Notice_** " to the Indemnifying Party. For the purposes
hereof, an "Indemnification Notice" shall mean a notice signed by any officer
of Indemnified Party and delivered to Indemnifying Party and (i) stating that
the Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, sustained or accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it will be obligated to pay, incur, sustain or

  



        
   

  



  

accrue, a Loss against which it is entitled to indemnity, (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of such Loss (including the calculation thereof
or the basis for estimation thereof), the date insofar as practicable such
Loss was paid or is expected to be incurred, sustained or accrued or the
basis on which it anticipates incurring, sustaining or accruing such Loss,
and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant
resulting in such Loss or out of which such Loss arose or to which such Loss
relates, and (iii) the amount of cash to be delivered to the Indemnified
Party (for the benefit of the pertinent Indemnitee) as indemnity against each
such Loss. If a Loss is anticipated but not yet incurred, sustained or
accrued at the time an Indemnification Notice is given, an additional
Indemnification Notice shall be given providing such information regarding
the Loss incurred, sustained or accrued as was not included in an earlier
Indemnification Notice. In a case where a Buyer Indemnitee or
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, other than Buyer or Coventry shall
seek to obtain the indemnity provided by Section 12.2 or Article VIII, Buyer
or Coventry, as applicable, shall give an appropriate Indemnification Notice
on behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee.

  



  

12.6 _Releases_. Effective upon the Closing, Buyer and each Acquired Entity,
and each of their respective representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " ** _Releasing Parties_** "), shall be deemed to have
remised, released and forever discharged the individuals set forth on Exhibit
B hereto (collectively, the " ** _D andO Released Parties_**") of and from any
and all Actions which the Releasing Parties, or any of them, now has or ever
had, or hereafter can, shall or may have, for, upon or by reason of any
matter, cause or thing whatsoever, against the DandO Released Parties, and each
of them, from the beginning of time through the Closing Date; provided,
however, that this Section 12.5(b) shall not apply to any Action that may
arise from any breach by any of the DandO Released Parties of, or the failure
to properly perform, any obligation or duty arising on the part of any of the
DandO Released Parties after the date hereof under this Agreement or any other
agreement to be entered into after the date hereof and contemplated hereby to
which any of the DandO Released Parties is a party.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 13**

  

 ** **

  

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

  

 ** **

  

13.1 _Public Announcement_.  The initial press release with respect to the
execution and Closing of this Agreement shall be either a joint press release
or coordinated press releases to be reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and
Coventry. Thereafter, neither Buyer nor Coventry shall issue any press
release or make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except that any Party may make any disclosure required
by applicable Law (including federal securities laws) or by the applicable
rules of any stock exchange on which Buyer or Coventry lists securities. A
Party, with respect to each such disclosure, shall provide the other Parties
with prior notice and a reasonable opportunity to review the disclosure.

  



        

  



  

13.2 _Payment of Costs and Expenses_.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, the Parties shall each bear their own respective costs and
expenses in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of
this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of agents, representatives,
counsel, accountants and investment bankers.

  



  

13.3 _Non-Assignment; Successors and Assigns_.  No Party shall assign this
Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may assign or delegate any or
all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to one or more
Affiliates of Buyer, _provided_ , _further_ , that any Party may assign its
right to receive a payment entitled to be received by it pursuant to this
Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns. In the event Buyer assigns this Agreement, Buyer
will remain primarily liable for its obligations hereunder unless expressly
released in writing by Sellers.

  



  

13.4 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (which term shall be deemed to
include the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other certificates,
documents and instruments delivered hereunder), together with the other
Transaction Agreements, set forth the entire understanding of the Parties,
and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and communications, whether
oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall not be modified or amended except by written agreement of the
Parties.

  



  

13.5 _Severability; Enforceability_.  If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon a determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect their original intent as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
maximum extent possible.

  



  

13.6 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument, and in pleading or proving any provision of this Agreement
it shall not be necessary to produce more than one such counterpart.

  



  

13.7 _Notices_. Any notice, request, consent or other instrument or thing
required or permitted to be given, made, served or delivered to any of the
Parties hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given, made, served or delivered (a) on the date delivered if delivered
personally; (b) on the next Business Day following the date of deposit (i) in
United States first-class express mail, postage prepaid or (ii) with an
overnight courier service guaranteeing next-Business Day delivery; or (c) on

13.8 _Waiver_.

  



  

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are cumulative
and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or
the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege.

  



  

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

  



  

(i) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred
to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by
a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by
the other Parties;

  



  

(ii) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given; and

  



  

(iii) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of
any obligation of such Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice
or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

13.9 _Third Parties_.  This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, the Hired Employees as provided in Article VII and the
Indemnified Party as provided in Article XII.

  



  

13.10 _Rules of Construction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with consent and upon the advice of said independent counsel. Each Party and
its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and
the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged between the Parties shall be deemed the work product of the Parties
and may not be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that
drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Parties hereto
covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included,
in whole or in

  



        
   

  



  

part (either as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the
calculation of any calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect
of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be
to cause such amount to be over- or under-counted for purposes of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

13.11 _Governing Law_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all
respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

  



  

(b) Any legal action or other proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement shall be brought or otherwise
commenced exclusively in the Court of Chancery or federal court located in
the State of Delaware.  Each Party:

  



  

(i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery and federal court located in the State of Delaware (and
each appellate court located in the State of Delaware), in connection with
any proceeding;

  



  

(ii) agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
mail addressed to him at the address set forth in Section 13.7 shall
constitute effective service of such process, summons, notice or document for
purposes of any such proceeding;

  



  

(iii) agrees that the Court of Chancery and federal court located in the
State of Delaware, shall be deemed to be a convenient forum; and

  



  

(iv) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise), in
any such proceeding, any claim by any Party that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of such court, that such proceeding has been brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such court.

  



  

13.12 _Non-Recourse_.  No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of Buyer or its Affiliates shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of Buyer under the Transaction
Agreements of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

13.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the non-
breaching Party and that the non-breaching Party will not have an adequate
remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement, including Sellers obligation to sell the

  



        
   

  



  

Acquired Assets and Shares to Buyer and Buyers obligation to purchase the
Acquired Assets and the Shares, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific
performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith.
Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement
or otherwise.

  



  

 _[Signature Page Follows.]_

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.
