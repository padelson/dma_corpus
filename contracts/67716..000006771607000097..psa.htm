of the aforesaid sale, assignment, conveyance,  transfer and delivery of the

funds denominated in U.S. Dollars or by such other means  as are agreed upon
by Seller and Buyer, as adjusted pursuant to Section  3.3.

(a) The  Purchase Price is premised upon CEM and CPI having as of the Closing
Date and  delivering to Buyer an aggregate Working Capital of Zero Dollars
($0) (the  "Working Capital Amount"). Accordingly, the Purchase Price shall
be (i)  increased by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate Working
Capital of  CEM  and CPI as of the Closing Date is greater than the Working
Capital Amount,  or  (ii) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate Working Capital  of  CEM and CPI as of the Closing Date is less
than the Working Capital Amount.  Any  such adjustment to the Purchase Price
shall be effected in accordance with  this  Section 3.3 (the "Adjustment").

 

 

(b) Seller  agrees to prepare and deliver to Buyer at least five (5) Business
Days prior  to  the Closing Date an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and
income statement  for each of CEM and CPI reflecting the financial condition
of each of CEM and  CPI as of the most recent month end prior to the Closing
Date, together with  a  statement setting forth (i) the estimated aggregate
Working Capital of CEM  and  CPI as of the Closing Date and (ii) the
Adjustment, if any, pursuant to clauses  (i) and (ii) of Section 3.3(a),
above (the "Initial Closing Statement"). Within  sixty (60) days after the

consolidated balance sheet and income statement reflecting  the financial
condition of each of CEM and CPI as of the Closing Date, together  with a
statement setting forth (i) the aggregate Working Capital of CEM and  CPI 
as of the Closing Date and (ii) the Adjustment, if any, pursuant to clauses 
(i)  and (ii) of Section 3.3(a) above (the "Closing Statement"). The Initial
Closing  Statement and the Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner
consistent  with the application of the accounting principles, practices and

(c) If  the  Initial Closing Statement sets forth an aggregate Working
Capital of CEM and  CPI  greater than the Working Capital Amount and a
corresponding upward adjustment  to  the Purchase Price, then the Purchase
Price payable on the Closing Date shall  be  increased by an amount equal to
such Adjustment. If the Initial Closing  Statement sets forth the aggregate
Working Capital of CEM and CPI less than  the  Working Capital Amount and a
corresponding downward adjustment to the Purchase  Price, then the Purchase
Price payable on the Closing Date shall be decreased  by  an amount equal to
such Adjustment. If the aggregate Working Capital of CEM  and  CPI as set
forth on the Closing Statement is different than that included on  the 
Initial Closing Statement, then (i) to the extent that the Working Capital 
on  the Closing Statement is greater than the Working Capital on the Initial
Closing  Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the absolute
value  of  such difference, and (ii) to the extent that the Working Capital
on the Closing  Statement is less than the Working Capital on the Initial
Closing Statement,  Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute
value of such  difference, subject to Section 3.3(d) below. In each case,
such payment shall  be  made in cash in immediately available funds within
twenty (20) days after the  date the Closing Statement becomes final under
Section 3.3(d). The Purchase  Price shall be deemed to be increased or
decreased (as the case may be) by  the  amounts calculated under this
Section 3.3(c). The Parties agree that for Income  Tax and all other Tax
purposes, the Parties shall and shall cause their  Affiliates to calculate
and timely report such increase or decrease with respect  to CPI and CEM on a
separate entity basis. The Parties shall promptly agree  upon  revisions to
all of the allocations prepared pursuant to Section 6.9(a) to  reflect such
increase or decrease, and the Parties shall and shall cause their  Affiliates
to not take a position on any Tax Return, with any Tax authority,  or 
otherwise that is inconsistent with such calculations and revised
allocations,  except to the extent specifically required pursuant to this 
Agreement.

 

 

(d) Each  Party shall make available to the other Party its work papers used
to prepare  its respective closing statement, and shall cooperate with the
other Party  in  connection with the preparation thereof. Seller shall
notify Buyer in writing  within twenty (20) days after receipt by Seller of
the Closing Statement of  any  objection to the items set forth therein,
which notice shall include a  reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons
for each objection by Seller  (an "Objection Notice"), provided, that the
Seller may only object to the items  contained in the Closing Statement to
the extent any such item was not prepared  in accordance with this Agreement
or contains mathematical errors. Any item  not  so objected to by Seller
shall be conclusively deemed to have been approved  by  Seller and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. If the Parties  are  unable to
resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt  by

determination solely of the  matters that remain in dispute and were properly

binding determination of  the  Adjustment amount, if any. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree upon a  Designated Independent Accounting Firm,
then each of the Buyer and Seller shall  designate one Independent Accounting
Firm and the two Independent Accounting  Firms so selected shall, within ten
(10) days after the date on which the later  of the two Independent
Accounting Firms are appointed, appoint a third  Independent Accounting Firm
(the "Third Independent Accounting Firm") and the  Third Independent
Accounting firm shall, within fifteen (15) days of its  appointment, make a
final and binding determination solely of the matters that  remain in dispute
and were properly included in the Objection Notice, and,  based  on such
resolution, a final and binding determination of the Adjustment amount,  if
any. The Designated Independent Accounting Firm or the Third Independent 
Accounting Firm, as the case may be, shall act on the following basis: such 
Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator; 
its  terms of reference shall be to determine the appropriate Adjustment
within  fifteen (15) days of its appointment, having strict regard to the
application  of  the terms of this Agreement to the same (and, for the
avoidance of doubt,  disregarding other means of calculating the same, to the
extent that such means  are inconsistent with or not provided for in this
Agreement); Buyer and Seller  shall each provide such Independent Accounting
Firm with all such information  as  it reasonably requires and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall base its  decision solely on such written
submissions by Buyer and Seller and their  respective representatives; such
Independent Accounting Firm shall not hold  any  hearings, hear any oral
testimony or otherwise seek or require any other  evidence and it may not
assign a value greater than the greatest value for  such  item claimed by
either Party or smaller than the smallest value for such item  claimed by
either Party. The final written determination of such Independent  Accounting
Firm shall (in the absence of fraud or manifest error) be conclusive  and
binding on the Parties. The Independent Accounting Firms shall not have 
the  power to amend or modify any terms of this Agreement. The costs of the 
Independent Accounting Firms shall be borne pro rata by Seller and Buyer in 
proportion to the difference between the Designated Independent Accounting 
Firm's or the Third Independent Accounting Firm's, as the case may be, final 
determination of any Adjustment amount and each of Buyer's and Seller's 
determination of such Adjustment amount. For example, if Buyer calculated an 
Adjustment amount of $100,000, Seller calculated an Adjustment amount of
$50,000  and the  Designated Independent Accounting Firm or the Third
Independent Accounting  Firm,  as the case may be, calculated  an
Adjustment amount of $60,000, Buyer would pay that portion of the
Independent  Accounting Firms' fees determined by dividing $40,000 ($100,000
- $60,000) by  $50,000 ($100,000 - $50,000) ( _i.e._ ,  80%)  and Seller
would pay the remaining 20% of such fees.

 

 

(e) Any  disputed amounts or any amounts not paid within five (5) days of
when due and  owing, plus interest thereon at the Default Interest Rate which
shall have  accrued from the due date until the date of payment, shall be
paid in accordance  with Section 3.3(c) above within ten (10) days after the
date the Designated  Independent Accounting Firm or the Third Independent
Accounting Firm, as the  case may be, provides to both Parties its final
written determination pursuant  to Section 3(d) above. In addition, any
amount not paid within ten (10) days  of  when due if not disputed in
accordance with Section 3.3(d) above shall accrue  interest at the Default
Interest Rate.

 

 

(f) Each  of  the Parties agrees and undertakes to the other to provide all
reasonable access,  necessary data and information, and to assist in the
calculations referred  to in  this Section 3.3.

the  Knowledge of Seller):

 

 

4.1 _Organization;  Qualification_.   Each  of  Seller, CEM, CPI, the
Investor Subsidiaries and the Service Subsidiaries is  a  corporation or
limited liability company duly incorporated or formed, validly  existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which  it  was

Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly 
authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action 
required on the part of Seller and this Agreement has been duly and validly 
executed and delivered by Seller. Subject to the receipt of Seller's
Required  Regulatory Approvals, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
and binding  agreement of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance
with its terms,  except that such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
other similar  laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and  general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered  in  a proceeding at law or in equity).

give rise to any  right of termination, consent, cancellation or
acceleration) under any of the  terms, conditions or provisions of any
material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,  material agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Seller, CEM,  CPI,  any Investor

made,  will not prevent Seller, CEM or CPI from performing its material
obligations  hereunder and (ii) such consents, approvals, filings or notices
which become  applicable to Seller, CEM, CPI, any Investor Subsidiary or any

violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree  applicable to Buyer,
which violations, individually or in the aggregate, would  create a Buyer

execution and delivery of this Agreement, or the consummation by Buyer of
the  transactions contemplated hereby, other than such consents, approvals,
filings  or notices, which, if not obtained or made, will not prevent Buyer
from  performing its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

5.4 _Legal  Proceedings_.   There  are  no actions or proceedings pending
against Buyer before any court or arbitrator  or Governmental Authority,
which, individually or in the aggregate, would  reasonably be expected to
create a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Buyer is  not  subject to any
outstanding judgments, rules, orders, writs, injunctions or  decrees of any
court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority which would,  individually or in
the aggregate, create a Buyer Material Adverse  Effect.

and warranties expressly contained herein and an independent  investigation
and evaluation of, and appraisal and judgment with respect to,  the  CPI
Stock and the CEM Membership Interests and the revenue, price, and expense 
assumptions applicable thereto. Buyer hereby acknowledges that neither the 
CPI  Stock nor the CEM Membership Interests have been registered under the
Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or registered or
qualified for  sale under any state securities laws and cannot be resold
without registration  thereunder or exemption therefrom. Buyer is an
"accredited investor," as such  term is defined in Regulation D of the
Securities Act, and will acquire the  CPI  Stock and the CEM Membership
Interests for its own account and not with a view  to a sale or distribution
thereof in violation of the Securities Act, and the  rules and regulations
thereunder, any applicable state blue sky laws or any  other applicable
securities laws. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and experience  in financial
and business matters to enable it to evaluate the risks of  investment in the
CPI Stock and the CEM Membership Interests and has the ability  to bear the
economic risk of this investment for an indefinite period of  time.

access shall be afforded by Seller  upon receipt of reasonable advance
written notice and during normal business  hours. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred  by  it or Seller with
respect to such access. If Seller shall desire to dispose  of  any books and

Information to any other Persons in  connection with Buyer's financing of its
purchase of the CPI Stock and CEM  Membership Interests or any equity
participation in Buyer's purchase of the CPI  Stock and CEM Membership
Interests, provided that such Persons are obligated  to  maintain the
confidentiality of the Proprietary Information in accordance with  this
Agreement.

 

 

(f) Upon  the  other Party's prior written approval (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or  delayed), either Party may provide Proprietary
Information of the other Party  to  the SEC, FERC or any other Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction or any  stock  exchange, as may be necessary to
obtain Seller's Required Regulatory Approvals,  or Buyer Required Regulatory
Approvals, respectively, or to comply generally  with any relevant law or
regulation. The disclosing Party will seek confidential  treatment for the
Proprietary Information provided to any Governmental Authority  and the
disclosing Party will notify the other Party as far in advance as is 
practicable of its intention to release to any Governmental Authority any 
Proprietary Information.

 

 

(g) Except  as  specifically provided herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, nothing in  this Section shall impair or modify any of the rights
or obligations of Buyer  or  its Affiliates under the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which remain in  effect until termination of such agreement
in accordance with its  terms.

 

 

(h) Except  as  may be permitted in the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer
agrees that, prior  to  the Closing Date, it will not contact any vendors,
off-takers, suppliers,  employees, or other contracting parties of CEM, CPI
or their respective  Affiliates with respect to any aspect of the business or
operations of CEM,  CPI  or any Project Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the  prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld.

 

 

(i) Buyer  shall not contact any Governmental Authority regarding any
pending, threatened  or potential Environmental Claim or with respect to any
Environmental Permit  relating to the Project Companies without Seller's
prior written  consent.

 

 

(j) At  Buyer's request, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall permit Buyer
to have  one representative located at each of CPI's and CEM's main offices
for the  purpose of observing their business operations. Seller shall cause
CPI and  CEM  to provide Buyer's representatives with reasonable use of
office space,  telephone and similar communications and office services and
shall provide  Buyer's representatives with reasonable access to
representatives of CPI and CEM  in order to assist Buyer in making an orderly
transition of CPI and CEM and  their respective Subsidiaries following the
Closing.

 

 

6.3 _Public  Statements_.   Subject  to the requirements imposed by any
applicable law or any Governmental Authority  or stock exchange, no press
release or other public announcement or public  statement or comment in
response to any inquiry relating to the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement shall be issued or made by any Party without  the  prior approval
of the other Parties (which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld).
The Parties agree to cooperate in preparing such  announcements.

 

 

6.4 _Expenses_.   Except  to  the extent specifically provided herein,
whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby are consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in  connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall  be  borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary herein,
Buyer will be responsible for all filing fees under  the  HSR Act.

 

 

6.5 _Further  Assurances_.   Subject  to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Parties hereto shall  use its best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,  or  cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable  laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the purchase and sale  of  the CPI Stock and
the CEM Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement,  including without
limitation using its best efforts to ensure satisfaction  of  the conditions
precedent to each Party's obligations hereunder, including  obtaining all
necessary consents, approvals, and authorizations of third parties  and
Governmental Authorities required to be obtained in order to consummate 
the  transactions hereunder. Buyer agrees to perform all conditions required
of  Buyer  in connection with Seller's Required Regulatory Approvals, other
than those  conditions which would create a Material Adverse Effect on the
Buyer or its  Subsidiaries after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. None of the Parties hereto shall, without
prior written consent  of  the other Party, take or fail to take any action,
which might reasonably be  expected to prevent or materially impede,
interfere with or delay the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.6 _Consents  and Approvals_.

 

 

(a) As  promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Seller and
Buyer,  as  applicable, shall each file or cause to be filed with the
Federal Trade  Commission and the United States Department of Justice any
notifications  required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated  thereunder with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties  shall use their respective Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to respond promptly  to any requests for additional
information made by either of such agencies,  and  to cause the waiting
periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the  earliest possible
date after the date of filing. Buyer will pay all filing  fees  under the
HSR Act, but each Party will bear its own costs of the preparation  and 
prosecution of any filing.

 

 

(b) As  promptly as practicable, and in any case within ten (10) days after
the date  of  this Agreement, Seller and Buyer, as applicable, shall file or
cause to be  filed  with the FERC such applications as are necessary to
obtain required FERC  approval for the various transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parties shall  consult with each other regarding such filings and
shall consider and  incorporate in such filings all reasonable comments, if
any, submitted by the  other Party with respect thereto. If appropriate, the
Parties will submit a  joint application to the FERC seeking such required
approvals. The Parties  shall  respond promptly to any requests for
additional information made by the FERC,  and use their respective best
efforts to cause regulatory approval to be  obtained at the earliest possible
date after the date of filing. Each Party  will  bear its own costs of the
preparation and prosecution of any such  filing.

 

 

(c) As  promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller  shall  make all such other filings and applications with
Governmental Authorities  seeking any other approval or authorization as may
be required for the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Parties shall respond  promptly to any requests for additional
information made by any such  Governmental Authority and shall use their
respective best efforts to obtain  any  such approval at the earliest
possible date after the date of the filing. Each  Party shall bear its own
costs of the preparation and prosecution of such  filings.

 

 

6.7 _Use  of  Centennial Marks._ Effective  upon the Closing Date, Seller
grants Buyer a perpetual, irrevocable,  royalty-free license to use the name
and trademark "CENTENNIAL POWER". Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that Seller
is the owner of the Intellectual Property  Rights in the trademark
"CENTENNIAL POWER" when used in connection with the  provision of energy,
power and other related services. Buyer further  acknowledges and agrees that
it obtains no Intellectual Property Rights to  or  any other right to use
the Centennial Marks other than as provided in this  Section 6.7. Buyer
agrees never to challenge Seller's (or its Affiliates')  ownership of the
Centennial Marks or any application for registration thereof  or  any
existing registration thereof or any other rights of Seller or its 
Affiliates therein as a result, directly or indirectly, of Buyer's ownership
of  the CPI Stock and the CEM Membership Interests. Buyer further agrees
never  to  apply for, either directly or through its Affiliates and/or
successors and  permitted assigns, any federal or state trademark, service
mark or any other  Intellectual Property Right featuring the term "CENTENNIAL
POWER" or any  variation, deviation, modification or abbreviation thereof.
Buyer warrants  that  its provision of services or products under the trade
name "CENTENNIAL POWER" shall conform to the quality and standards adhered to
by Seller and that Seller  shall have the right, upon reasonable request, to
review and modify, for quality  assurance purposes, Buyer's use of the
trademark "CENTENNIAL POWER" in Buyer's  advertising and marketing. Within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer  shall, except for the
trademark "CENTENNIAL POWER", (i) remove the Centennial  Marks from the
assets of CPI, CEM, the Project Companies, the Investor  Subsidiaries and the
Service Subsidiaries, including signage at the Project  Facilities, and
provide written verification thereof to Seller promptly after  completing
such removal and (ii) return or destroy (with proof of destruction)  all
other assets of CPI, CEM, the Project Companies, the Investor Subsidiaries 
and the Service Subsidiaries that contain any Centennial Marks that are not 
removable.

 

 

6.8 _Fees  and Commissions_.   Seller,  on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, represent and warrant to the  other that, no broker, finder or
other Person is entitled to any brokerage  fees,  commissions or finder's
fees in connection with the transaction contemplated  hereby by reason of any
action taken by the Party making such representation,  except that Seller has
engaged, and shall bear the liability for the commissions  and fees of,
Goldman, Sachs and Co. in connection with the transactions  contemplated
hereby. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,  will  pay to
the other or otherwise discharge, and will indemnify and hold the other 
harmless from and against, any and all claims or liabilities for all
brokerage  fees, commissions and finder's fees incurred by reason of any
action taken by  the indemnifying party.

 

 

6.9 _Tax  Matters_.

 

 

(a) _Section  338(h)(10) Elections_.

 

 

(i) Seller  and Buyer shall jointly make or cause to be made timely and
irrevocable  elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (the "Election")
with  respect to the sale of each of CPI and CEM and the deemed sale of each
of the  Investor Subsidiaries, the Service Subsidiaries and the Project
Companies  constituting corporations for federal income Tax purposes, except
that no such  elections shall be made with respect to Hartwell Power Company
(such entities  for which elections shall be made, the "338(h)(10) Election
Entities"). In  addition, Seller and Buyer shall jointly make all elections
under state and  local Tax law comparable to the elections under Section
338(h)(10) or  Section 338(g) as available, unless such state or locality
does not have a  provision comparable to Section 338(h)(10) or Section
338(g), in which  case no election shall be made in such state or locality
(together with the  Election, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). Seller 
and Buyer shall and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates 
to  (i) treat the Section 338(h)(10) Elections as valid, (ii) file all Tax 
Returns in a manner consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Elections and 
(iii) take no position contrary thereto. Seller  shall be responsible for and
shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid to  applicable Governmental
Authorities all Income Taxes imposed on Seller and  all  338(h)(10) Election
Entities that are attributable to the making of the Section  338(h)(10)
Elections, provided, however, that for any state or local  jurisdiction that
imposes Income Tax on both the sale (or deemed sale) of the  stock of a
338(h)(10) Election Entity and the deemed sale of assets of such  338(h)(10)
Election Entity, Seller shall be responsible for only the Income  Tax 
imposed on the sale (or deemed sale) of the stock of such 338(h)(10)
Election  Entity and Buyer shall be responsible for and shall timely pay or
cause to  be  timely paid to applicable Governmental Authorities all Income
Taxes imposed  on  the deemed sale of assets of such 338(h)(10) Election
Entity (such Taxes for  which Buyer is responsible, the "Buyer 338
Liability").

 

 

(ii) Prior  to  the Closing, Buyer shall (A) determine the amount of the
adjusted grossed-up  basis and aggregate deemed sales price with respect to
each of the 338(h)(10)  Election Entities and the allocation of such amounts
among the assets of each  of  the 338(h)(10) Election Entities on a separate
entity basis in accordance with  Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder  and (B) deliver a schedule of all
such determinations to Seller and provide  Seller with a reasonable
opportunity to review, comment on, and consent to  such  schedule prior to
the Closing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  or delayed
(the "338 Allocation"). Buyer shall promptly revise the 338  Allocation to
reflect the Adjustment, as finally determined pursuant to Section  3.3 of the
Agreement and Buyer shall promptly forward a draft of the revised  338 
Allocation to Seller for Seller's consent, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller and Buyer shall take, and shall
cause  their respective Affiliates to take, no action inconsistent with, or
fail to  take any action necessary for the validity of each Section
338(h)(10) Election,  and shall adopt and utilize, and cause their respective
Affiliates to adopt  and  utilize, the asset values prescribed in the 338
Allocation (as revised by Seller  and Buyer) in making such allocations for
the purpose of all Tax Returns filed  by them, and shall not voluntarily take
any action inconsistent therewith upon  examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim, in any litigation or  otherwise with respect to such Tax
Returns. Buyer and Seller shall notify and  provide the other with reasonable
assistance in the event of an examination,  audit or other proceeding
regarding the agreed upon allocations.

 

 

(iii) The  Purchase Price allocable to Hartwell Independent Power Partners,
Inc. and Hart  County IPP, Inc. and the share of each such entity of the
liabilities of the  Hartwell Partnership shall be allocated among the assets
of the Hartwell  Partnership as of the Closing Date in accordance with a
schedule to be prepared  in accordance with the rules under Code Sections
743(b), 751, 755 and 1060  (the "754 Allocation Schedule"). Buyer shall
deliver a draft of the 754 Allocation  Schedule to Seller and the Hartwell
Partnership as soon as practicable after  the  date of this Agreement, and
Buyer, Seller and the Hartwell Partnership shall  mutually agree upon the 754
Allocation Schedule at or prior to the Closing.  Buyer and Seller shall not,
and Seller shall use all Commercially Reasonable  Efforts to cause the
Hartwell Partnership to not, unreasonably withhold its  approval and consent
with respect to the 754 Allocation Schedule. Buyer and  Seller agree that the
754 Allocation Schedule shall be amended to reflect any  post-Closing
adjustments to the allocation that are required by applicable  federal income
Tax law. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer  and  Seller
agree to act, and to cause their Affiliates and the Hartwell Partnership  to
act, in accordance with the computations and allocations contained in the 
754  Allocation Schedule (taking into account any such amendment thereto) in
any  relevant Tax Returns or similar filings (including forms or reports, if
any,  required to be filed pursuant to Code Section 1060), to cooperate in
the  preparation of any such filings, to timely file such filings in the
manner  required by applicable law and to not take any position inconsistent
with such  754 Allocation Schedule in any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in
any  litigation, or otherwise.

 

 

(b) _Return  Filing, Payments, Refunds and Credits._

 

 

(i) Seller  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Federal,  state and local Tax Returns for (x) CEM, CPI, the
Investor Subsidiaries, the  Service Subsidiaries and the Project Companies
(other than Hartwell Partnership)  (the "Target Entities") for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods of such entities,  including the consolidated federal
income Tax Return of MDU Resources Group,  Inc. for the Tax period ending on
December 31, 2007, and (y) any Affiliated  Group that includes any of the
Target Entities (other than an Affiliated Group  that has no members other
than two or more of the Target Entities) (an "MDU  Affiliated Group"). Each
such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner  consistent with past practice.
Buyer  shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend, refile,
modify or  revoke such Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating
thereto)  without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be  unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,  for the avoidance of
doubt, that the Seller shall be deemed to have reasonably  withheld its
consent if any such action by Buyer or its Affiliates could  reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact upon any Taxes or Tax Returns  (or Tax
attribute) of Seller or any of its Affiliates for any Tax period ending  on
or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period. Buyer and Seller shall 
act in good faith to resolve any disputes, but in the event Buyer and Seller 
do  not resolve any disputed items by agreement, either Buyer or Seller may
refer  such dispute to an Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, and the
decision  of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on
Buyer and  Seller and their respective Affiliates. The costs, expenses and
fees of the  Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on
the one hand,  and Buyer, on the other hand.  Buyer  shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to timely provide Seller with all  information as Seller shall
reasonably request in connection with the  preparation of such Tax Returns.
Seller  and its Affiliates shall be responsible for payment of any Income
Taxes, and  shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Income Taxes,
shown as due on  such Tax Returns, except that Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be responsible  for  the timely payment of any Buyer 338 Liability and any
Income Taxes resulting  from any transaction or event that is not in the
ordinary course of business  and  occurs after the Closing on the Closing
Date. Buyer shall timely pay or cause  to  be timely paid all Taxes (other
than Income Taxes) shown as due on such Tax  Returns. The income or loss or
other items to be reported on the federal income  Tax Return to be filed for
CEM, CPI, the Investor Subsidiaries, the Service  Subsidiaries and the
Project Companies (other than the Hartwell Partnership)  for  the period
that began on January 1, 2007 and ends on the Closing Date shall  be  based
upon a closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing  Date,
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b). Buyer and Seller 
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Investor
Subsidiaries' distributive shares of the income or loss of the Hartwell
Partnership for the  fiscal year that includes the Closing Date to be
reported in the Tax Return  described in the preceding sentence and
determined based upon a hypothetical  closing of the books of Hartwell
Partnership as of the Closing Date, consistent  with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi)(A). Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that all  transactions and events in
respect of any of the Target Entities and the  Hartwell Partnership that are
not in the ordinary course of business and occur  after the Closing on the
Closing Date shall be reported on the Tax Return(s)  of  Buyer and its
Affiliates to the extent required or permitted by Treasury  Regulation
section 1.338-1(d) or 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or other applicable  federal or
state Tax law.

 

 

(ii) Buyer  shall, except to the extent that such Tax Returns are the
responsibility of  Seller under Section 6.9(b)(i), timely prepare and file or
cause to be timely  prepared and filed all Tax Returns of CEM, CPI, the
Investor Subsidiaries,  the  Service Subsidiaries and the Project Companies
(other than Hartwell  Partnership). For any Straddle Period Tax Return that
is the responsibility  of  Buyer under this Section 6.9(b)(ii), Buyer shall,
and shall cause its  Affiliates to, prepare such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with past  practices and with all Tax Returns prepared or caused
to be prepared by Seller  pursuant to Section 6.9(b)(i) with respect to the
entity in question, and Buyer  shall deliver to Seller for its review,
comment and approval (which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld) a
copy of each such proposed Tax Return  (accompanied, in the case of each
Income Tax Tax Return, by an allocation of  the  Income Taxes shown to be
due on such Tax Return between the portion of such  Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle  Period beginning after the
Closing Date) at least thirty Business Days prior  to  (a) the due date for
filing such Tax Return (giving effect to any validly  obtained extensions),
or (b) if there is no due date for filing, the actual  filing date thereof.
Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to not  unreasonably fail to
reflect any comments received from Seller.  Buyer  shall timely pay or cause
to be timely paid all Taxes shown as due on such  Tax  Returns. Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for Income Taxes shown to be due on such  Tax Returns as
filed, to the extent allocable to the portion of such Straddle  Period ending
on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the  amount of
Income Taxes allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period  beginning
after the Closing Date to the extent such Income Taxes were paid  on or 
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of 
any  refunds or credits of Income Taxes allocable to the portion of such
Straddle  Period ending on the Closing Date. For  purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, Income Taxes  allocable to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date  shall be computed
as if the Tax period ended on the Closing Date, except  that any Buyer 338
Liability and any Income Taxes resulting from any transaction  or event that
is not in the ordinary course of business and occurs after the  Closing on
the Closing Date shall be allocable to the portion of such Straddle  Period
beginning after the Closing Date.  Buyer  shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates to not, amend, refile, modify or  revoke any Straddle Period Tax
Return (or any notification or election relating  thereto) without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not  be  unreasonably
withheld; provided,  for the avoidance of doubt, that the Seller shall be
deemed to have reasonably  withheld its consent if any such action by Buyer
or its Affiliates could  reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact
upon any Taxes or Tax Returns  (or Tax attribute) of Seller or any of its
Affiliates for any Tax period ending  on or prior to the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period. Buyer and Seller shall  act in good faith to resolve any
disputes, but in the event Buyer and Seller  do  not resolve any disputed
items by agreement, either Buyer or Seller may refer  such dispute to an
Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, and the decision  of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Buyer and  Seller
and their respective Affiliates. The costs, expenses and fees of the 
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one
hand,  and Buyer, on the other hand.

 

 

(iii) Seller  and its Affiliates shall be entitled to any refunds or credits
of or against  any  Excluded Taxes and any other Taxes for which Seller or
its Affiliates are  responsible pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall, at
Seller\'s reasonable  request, file or cause the relevant entity to file for
and use Commercially  Reasonable Efforts to obtain any refund or credit to
which Seller and its  Affiliates are entitled.

 

 

(iv) Buyer  shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly forward to
Seller and its  Affiliates or reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any
refunds or credits  of  Taxes due Seller and its Affiliates (pursuant to the
terms of this Section  6.9)  after receipt thereof.

 

 

(v) Buyer  shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, elect, where permitted
by applicable  law, to carry forward any item of loss, deduction or credit
which arises in  any  Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) _Cooperation  on Tax Matters._

 

 

(i) Buyer  and  Seller shall (and each shall cause CEM, CPI, the Investor
Subsidiaries, the  Service Subsidiaries and the Project Companies to)
cooperate fully, as and  to  the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the  preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section and in connection  with any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes for any  Tax  period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date. Such cooperation shall include  the retention and (upon the
other Party's request) the provision of records and  information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or  other  proceeding and
making employees (to the extent such employees were responsible  for the
preparation, maintenance or interpretation of information and documents 
relevant to Tax matters or to the extent required as witnesses in any Tax 
proceedings), available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional 
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties 
agree (A) to retain, and (in the case of Buyer) to cause CEM, CPI, the
Investor  Subsidiaries, the Service Subsidiaries and the Project Companies to
retain,  all  books and records with respect to Income Tax matters pertinent
to CEM, CPI,  the  Investor Subsidiaries, the Service Subsidiaries and the
Project Companies  relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing
Date until six months  after the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified  by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of
the respective Tax periods,  and  to abide by all record retention
obligations imposed by law or pursuant to  agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (B) to give the  other Party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or  discarding any such books and records
and, if the other Party so requests,  Buyer  or Seller, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Party to take possession  of  such books and records.

 

 

(ii) Buyer  and  Seller further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any  certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other  Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could  be imposed with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(iii) At  Seller\'s request, Buyer shall cause CEM, CPI, the Investor
Subsidiaries, the  Service Subsidiaries and the Project Companies to make
and/or join with Seller  and any of Seller's Affiliates in making after
Closing any election for which  such entity's consent is required for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending  on or prior to the Closing Date, if the
making of such election does not have  a  material adverse impact on Buyer
(or any of its Affiliates) for any Tax period  beginning after the Closing
Date.

 

 

(d) _Contests._

 

 

(i) Seller  and Buyer shall notify the other Party in writing within fourteen
(14) days  or  such shorter period as may be required thereby of receipt by
it or any of its  Affiliates of written notice of any pending or threatened
Tax examination,  audit  or other administrative or judicial proceeding (a
"Tax Contest") that could  reasonably be expected to result in an
indemnification obligation of such other  Party pursuant to this Agreement
and  such  timely notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for
any claim  included therein and shall include a copy of the relevant portion
of any  correspondence received from the taxing authority.  If the 
recipient of such notice of a Tax Contest fails to provide such timely
notice  to  such other Party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Taxes  arising in connection with such Tax Contest, but only to the
extent, if any,  that such failure or delay shall have adversely affected the
indemnifying  Party's ability to defend against, settle, or satisfy any
action, suit or  proceeding against it, or any damage, loss, claim, or demand
for which the  indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, 
and the  indemnifying Party's indemnity obligations shall be reduced to the
extent of any  Tax or other liability incurred as a result of the delay or
failure to receive  such timely notice.

 

 

(ii) If  a Tax  Contest relates to any Taxes for which Seller is liable in
full hereunder,  Seller shall at its expense control the defense and
settlement of such Tax  Contest. If such Tax Contest relates to any Taxes for
which Buyer is liable  in  full hereunder, Buyer shall at its own expense
control the defense and  settlement of such Tax Contest. The Party not in
control of the defense shall  have the right to observe the conduct of any
Tax Contest at its expense,  including through its own counsel and other
professional experts. Buyer and  Seller shall jointly represent CEM, CPI, any
Investor Subsidiary, any Service  Subsidiary or any Project Company in any
Tax Contest relating to Taxes for  which  both are liable hereunder, and
fees and expenses related to such representation  shall be paid equally by
Buyer and Seller.

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in Section 6.9(d)(ii), to the
extent that an issue  raised in any Tax Contest controlled by one Party or
jointly controlled could  materially affect the liability for Taxes of the
other Party, the controlling  Party shall not, and neither Party in the case
of joint control shall, enter  into a final settlement without the consent of
the other Party, which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld. Where a
Party reasonably withholds its  consent to any final settlement, that Party
may continue or initiate further  proceedings, at its own expense, and the
liability of the Party that wished  to  settle (as between the consenting
and the non-consenting Party) shall not exceed  the liability that would have
resulted from the proposed final settlement  including interest, additions to
Tax, and penalties that have accrued at that  time, and the non-consenting
Party shall indemnify the consenting Party for  any  liability in excess of
liability that would have resulted from the proposed  final settlement.

 

 

(iv) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if a Tax Contest results  in an increase in Income Taxes for which Seller is
liable hereunder and such  increase is attributable to adjustments based on
timing differences which will  reverse in Tax periods ending subsequent to
the Closing Date, Buyer shall  promptly pay to Seller, upon Seller\'s written
request, an amount equal to the  present value of the reduction in Income
Taxes payable by the Buyer and its  Affiliates in future Tax periods by
reason of such reversal, determined by  using  a discount rate of 6% and an
assumed Tax rate of 40%, and by assuming that  such  reduction in Income
Taxes will occur in the year or years of  reversal.

 

 

(e) _Tax  Sharing Agreements_.  Any Tax  sharing agreement or similar
arrangement between Seller or any Affiliate of  Seller (other than CEM, CPI,
the Investor Subsidiaries, the Service Subsidiaries  and the Project
Companies) on the one hand, and any of CEM, CPI, the Investor  Subsidiaries,
the Service Subsidiaries or the Project Companies on the other  hand shall be
terminated with respect to CEM, CPI, the Investor Subsidiaries,  the Service
Subsidiaries and the Project Companies, as applicable, as of the  Closing
Date.

 

 

(f) _Certain  Taxes_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all transfer,  documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees  (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this  Agreement, whether imposed upon Seller, Buyer, CEM,
CPI, any Investor  Subsidiary, any Service Subsidiary or any Project Company
("Transfer Taxes"),  shall be borne 50 percent by Seller and 50 percent by
Buyer. Seller and Buyer  shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
to prepare and timely file  all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such  Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable law,
Buyer shall, and shall  cause  CEM, CPI, the Investor Subsidiaries, Service
Subsidiaries and Project Companies  to, join in the execution of all such Tax
Returns and other documentation.  All  costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the filing of all such Tax  Returns and documentation
hereunder shall be borne by Buyer.

 

 

(g) _Disputes_.  In the  event that a dispute arises between Seller and
Buyer as to the amount of Taxes,  or indemnification, whether or not
attributable to CEM or CPI, the Parties  shall  attempt in good faith to
resolve such dispute, and any agreed upon amount shall  be paid to the
appropriate Party. If such dispute is not resolved thirty (30)  days
thereafter, the Parties shall submit the dispute to an Independent 
Accounting Firm mutually appointed by Seller and Buyer for resolution, which 
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and 
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in resolving the dispute shall 
be  borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Any payment required to be made as a
result  of the resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be  made within ten (10) days after such resolution, together with any
interest  determined by the Independent Accounting Firm to be appropriate.

 

 

(h) _Alternative  Structure_.  The  Parties agree to discuss in good faith
alternative structures to complete the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, but Buyer acknowledges that  (x) no such alternatives shall delay
the Closing Date or increase the risks  or costs of the transactions to
Seller or decrease the net after-tax proceeds  received by Seller from the
transactions and (y) that Seller shall have no  obligation to agree to any
such alternative structure.

 

 

6.10 _Advice  of Changes_.   Prior  to  the Closing, each Party will
promptly advise the other in writing with respect  to any matter arising
after execution of this Agreement of which that Party  obtains knowledge and
which, if existing or occurring at the date of this  Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth in this Agreement, including  any of the
Schedules hereto, or of any breach of any representation or warranty  or of
any other condition or circumstance that would excuse a Party of timely 
performance of its obligations hereunder. Subject to Buyer's consent, Seller
may  cause CEM, CPI, the Investor Subsidiaries, the Service Subsidiaries or
the  Project Companies to amend, substitute or otherwise modify any CEM
Agreement,  CPI Agreement or Project Contract to the extent that any such
agreement expires  by its terms prior to the Closing Date. Nothing contained
herein shall relieve  Seller or Buyer of any breach of representation,
warranty or covenant under  this  Agreement existing as of the date hereof
or any subsequent date as of which  such  representation, warranty or
covenant shall have been made; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Seller
shall have no liability to Buyer for any breach of any representation, 
warranty or covenant hereunder which results from Buyer withholding its
consent  under the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller  shall be entitled to cause BIV Generation and Brush Power,
LLC to enter into  the  Replacement PPA subject to Section 6.1(b) hereof.

 

 

6.11 _Consents._ Seller  shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain
all consents and approvals  for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby required under  any  CEM Agreement, CPI Agreement or
Major Project Contract, and all required waivers  of any rights of first
refusal, rights of first offer, or similar preemptive  rights with respect to
any of the Project Company Interests necessary in order  to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.12 _Buyer  Financial Assurance_.  Simultaneous with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is  providing to Seller (a) an irrevocable
standby letter of credit from Barclays  Bank PLC in the stated amount of $50
million (the "Buyer LC") which shall  permit, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Seller to draw  up  to $50 million in payment
of the Termination Fee, and (b) an equity commitment  letter (the "Equity
Commitment Letter") from Natural Gas Partners VIII L.P.  dated the date
hereof, addressed to Buyer confirming the commitment and  availability of not
less than $120 million, which funds will be provided to  Buyer on or before
the Closing Date in order to fund a portion of the payment  of  the Purchase
Price.

 

 

6.13 _Financing  Cooperation._ At  Buyer's request, Seller shall, and shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause  CEM, CPI and their respective
Subsidiaries to, provide reasonable cooperation  with Buyer and Buyer's
lenders in connection with Buyer obtaining debt financing  for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including making 
representatives of such parties available at reasonable times in connection 
with  the syndication of such debt financing and related activities.

 

 

6.14 _Employee  and Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  specifically provided in this Section 6.14, Seller shall,
and shall cause,  CEM,  CPI, the Investor Subsidiaries, the Service
Subsidiaries and the Project  Companies to take all necessary actions,
including compliance with all  applicable Laws, such that (i) immediately
prior to the Closing, none of  these entities shall sponsor, maintain,
participate in, contribute to or have  an  obligation to contribute to any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement on or after  the Closing, and (ii) Seller
shall retain all Liabilities with respect to the  Benefit Plans and Benefit
Agreements, including but not limited to liability  for  all employer
contributions required to be made to a Benefit Plan which is a  cash  or
deferred arrangement qualified under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. 
As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall waive all pre-existing condition
limitations  under Buyer's health care plan for employees continuing in
employment with Buyer  on and after the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees")
and covered by the health  care plan in which CEM, CPI, the Investor
Subsidiaries, Service Subsidiaries  and  any of the Project Companies
participated immediately prior to the Closing  Date  (the "Seller Health
Plan"), and shall provide such health care coverage  substantially similar in
the aggregate to the Seller Health Plan effective  as of  the Closing Date
without the application of any eligibility period for coverage.  In addition,
with respect to Continuing Employees, Buyer shall cause its health  care plan
to credit all employee payments toward deductible and co-payment  obligations
limits under the Seller Health Plan for the plan year that includes  the
Closing Date as if such payments had been made for similar purposes under 
Buyer's health care plan during the plan year that includes the Closing 
Date.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.14(a), Seller shall spin-off
and transfer all of  the  obligations and liabilities of any Benefit Plan
that is a Section 125 flexible  spending plan (the "Seller 125 Plan")
attributable to employees of CPI and CEM  and their dependents and
beneficiaries to a Section 125 flexible spending plan  to be established by
CEM (the "New 125 Plan") immediately prior to the Closing  Date, and the New
125 Plan shall credit each such employee\'s flexible spending  account with
the balance so transferred. Each employee eligible to participate  in the New
125 Plan shall be permitted to continue his or her election in effect  under
the New 125 Plan for the remainder of the calendar year in which the  Closing
shall occur, subject to the limitation on contributions contained in  the 
Seller 125 Plan, and CEM shall honor any such election, and the New 125 Plan 
shall honor (and shall be solely liable for) any claims incurred by an
employee  in the calendar year, which would otherwise be an eligible expense
under the  Seller 125 Plan, whether or not such expense was incurred before,
on or after  the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with all
information reasonably  requested by Buyer in order for CEM and the New 125
Plan to satisfy the  obligations set forth in this Section 6.14(b). As soon
as administratively  practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall pay
to Buyer the balance  of  CPI and CEM employees' accounts under the Seller
125 Plan; provided, however,  that if the balance of CPI and CEM employees'
accounts under the Seller 125 Plan  is less than zero, Buyer shall pay to
Seller the amount by which such balance  is  less than zero.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.14(a), as soon as
practicable following the Closing  Date, Seller shall fully vest the account
balances of each CPI and CEM employee  who is a participant in the Benefit
Plan that is a 401(k) plan (the "Seller  401(k) Plan") and shall offer each
such participant the opportunity to rollover  such participant's account
balance to a defined contribution 401(k) plan  established or maintained by
Buyer or CEM that is a qualified tax or deferred  arrangement under Code
Sections 401(a) and 401(k). Such rollover shall be in  the  form of a direct
rollover in accordance with Section 401(a)(31) of the Code  and  other
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and shall include the 
opportunity for participants to rollover all participant loan accounts and 
liabilities under the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

 

6.15 _Audited  Financial Statements._ Seller  shall deliver to Buyer the
audited balance sheet, income statement and statement  of cash flows of CEM
and CPI as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006,  (which audited
financial statements shall not vary in any material respect  from  the
Financial Statements), as promptly as possible, but in no event later than 
one (1) Business Day after such audited financial statements are available. 
Seller agrees that Buyer may, upon written request, postpone the Closing
Date  by  one day for each day beyond May 1, 2007 that Buyer has not
received such audited  financial statements.

 

 

6.16 _Hartwell  Partnership Distributions._ Promptly  (but in any event not
later than three (3) Business Days) after Buyer's receipt  thereof, Buyer
shall remit to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available  funds,
Seller's share of Hartwell Partnership distributions or payments with 
respect to or to the extent allocable to all periods prior to the Closing
Date.  The Parties agree that Seller's allocable share of such distributions
or  payments shall be based on the number of days of Seller's indirect
ownership of  the Hartwell Partnership during the period to which such
distribution or payment  relates divided by the total number of days during
such period.

(a) Buyer  shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its officers,
directors,  employees, shareholders, Affiliates, their respective successors,
permitted  assigns and agents (each, a "Seller's Indemnitee") from and
against any and all  claims, demands, suits, losses, liabilities, damages,
obligations, payments,  costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
the costs and expenses of  any  and all actions, suits, proceedings,
assessments, judgments, settlements and  compromises relating thereto, costs
of investigation and enforcement under  this  Article VIII and reasonable
attorneys' fees and reasonable disbursements in  connection therewith) (each,
an "Indemnifiable Loss"), asserted against or  suffered by any Seller's
Indemnitee relating to, resulting from or arising out  of (i) any breach by
Buyer of any representation, warranty, covenant or  agreement of Buyer
contained in this Agreement  or in  any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Buyer pursuant to  this  Agreement, (ii) any loss or damages
directly resulting from or arising out  of  any negligent act or omission or
willful misconduct of Buyer or Buyer's  Representatives in connection with
Buyer's Inspections, (iii) any Third Party  Claims against any Seller's
Indemnitee arising out of or in connection with  Buyer's ownership or
operation of CEM or CPI on or after the Closing Date, (iv)  any Third Party
Claim asserted against any Seller's Indemnitee by any member or  partner of
any Project Company resulting from or arising out of any deemed  sale  or
exchange of an interest in such Project Company resulting from any of the 
Section 338(h)(10) Elections made or caused to be made by Seller and Buyer 
pursuant to Section 6.9(a) and (v) the Guarantee Liabilities.

 

 

(b) Seller  shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its officers,
directors,  employees, shareholders, Affiliates, their respective successors,
permitted  assigns and agents (each, a "Buyer Indemnitee") from and against
any and all  Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee  relating to, resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach by
Seller of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller
contained in this  Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf
of Seller pursuant  to  this Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Liabilities and
(iii) any Third Party Claims  against a Buyer Indemnitee arising out of or in
connection with (x) Seller's  ownership or operation of CEM or CPI prior to
the Closing Date, (y) CEM, CPI  or  Seller's ownership or operation of the
Excluded Assets prior to, on or after the  Closing Date and (z) the Excluded
Liabilities.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein:

 

 

(i) Any  Person entitled to receive indemnification under this Agreement
(an "Indemnitee") shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate all
losses,  damages and the like relating to a claim under these indemnification
provisions,  including availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights
of contribution,  claims against third Persons and other rights at law or
equity. The Indemnitee's  Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall include the
reasonable expenditure of  money to mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate
any loss or expenses for  which indemnification would otherwise be due, and
the Indemnitor shall reimburse  the Indemnitee for the Indemnitee's
reasonable expenditures in undertaking the  mitigation; and

Indemnifiable Loss,  and  (B) Tax benefits to the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates, to the extent  realized or reasonably expected to be realized by
the Indemnitee or any of  its  Affiliates. Any Party seeking indemnity
hereunder shall use Commercially  Reasonable Efforts to seek coverage
(including both costs of defense and  indemnity) under applicable insurance
policies with respect to any such  Indemnifiable Loss and the reasonable
costs of such Commercially Reasonable  Efforts shall be an indemnifiable
claim under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) The  expiration or termination of any representation, warranty or
covenant or  agreement shall not affect the Parties' obligations under this
Section 8.1 if  the Indemnitee provided the Person required to provide
indemnification under  this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party") with proper
notice of the claim or  event for which indemnification is sought prior to
such expiration, termination  or extinguishment.

 

 

(e) Except  to  the extent otherwise provided in Article IX, the rights and
remedies of Seller  and Buyer under this Article VIII are exclusive and in
lieu of any and all  other  rights and remedies which Seller and Buyer may
have under this Agreement or  otherwise for monetary relief, with respect to

representation or warranty set forth in  this  Agreement, after the
occurrence of the Closing, or (ii) liabilities of CEM  or  CPI being assumed
by Buyer or the Excluded Liabilities, as the case may be;  provided, however,
that the provisions of this Section 8.1(e) shall not  prevent or limit (i) a
claim of, or a cause of action arising from, fraud  or (ii) a cause of action
to obtain equitable remedies. The indemnification  obligations of the Parties
set forth in this Article VIII apply only to  matters arising out of this
Agreement.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, no Party (including an
Indemnitee) shall be  entitled to recover from any other Party (including an
Indemnifying Party)  for  any liabilities, damages, obligations, payments
losses, costs, or expenses  under  this Agreement any amount in excess of
the actual compensatory damages, court  costs and reasonable attorney's and
other advisor fees suffered by such Party.  Buyer and Seller waive any right
to recover punitive, incidental, special,  exemplary and consequential
damages arising in connection with or with respect  to this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 8.1(f) shall not apply to  (i)  a claim of or
cause of action arising from fraud or (ii) indemnification for  a  Third
Party Claim or (iii) with respect to the Guarantee  Liabilities.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, (i) except as provided
in (ii) -  (iv) below, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for 
Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of a breach 
of  representation or warranty (other than the Seller Fundamental
Representations  and the Buyer Fundamental Representations), unless and until
the amount of  such  Indemnifiable Losses exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($250,000),  in  the aggregate, in which event the respective Party
shall then only be liable  for  the amount of such excess, but only up to
the aggregate amount of 5% of the  Purchase Price, provided that such Party's
liability and obligation must be  asserted by the other Party within the
applicable survival period specified  in  Section 8.3, (ii) Seller's
liability and obligation to Buyer for an  Indemnifiable Loss relating to,
resulting from or arising out of a breach of  representation or warranty with
respect to (A) Sections 4.11 (Tax Matters)  and  4.20(h) (Taxes) and (B)
Section 4.8 (Benefit Plans) shall not be limited in  amount but must be
asserted by Buyer on or before the termination of the related  survival
period set forth in Section 8.3; (iii) Buyer's liability and  obligation for
Indemnifiable Losses arising out of the Guarantee Liabilities  shall not be
limited in either amount or the time when Seller may assert a  claim  with

provisions of Section 6.9(b) (other than  Buyer 338 Liability and Income
Taxes resulting from any transaction or event  that occurs after the Closing
on the Closing Date and is not in the ordinary  course of business), (B)
Income Taxes payable by CEM, CPI, any Investor  Subsidiary, any  Service

ending on or before the Closing Date, which in the case of any Straddle
Period,  shall be deemed to be the amount of  such  Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator  of  which is the
number of days during the portion of the Straddle Period ending  on  the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in 
the  Straddle Period, (F) any  losses incurred by Buyer based upon CEM, CPI
or any of their Subsidiaries being  affiliated under Code Section 414 or
ERISA Section 4001(a)(14) on or prior  to the Closing Date with Seller and/or
any Affiliates or Subsidiaries of  Seller;  provided, however, that in the
case of clauses (D) and (E), such liability  or  obligation only to the
extent that it exceeds the accrual for such Taxes  reflected as a liability
in Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant  to  Section 3.3
(collectively, "Excluded Taxes") and (G) any liability or obligation  with
respect to Indebtedness of CEM, CPI or any of their Subsidiaries, on the  one
hand, to their Affiliates, on the other hand (other than Affiliates which 
are either Investor Subsidiaries, Project Companies or Service 
Subsidiaries);

 

 

(ii) Any  fines, penalties or costs imposed by a Governmental Authority
resulting from  (A)  an investigation, proceeding, request for information
or inspection before  or by  a Governmental Authority either pending prior
to or arising after the Closing  Date but only regarding acts which occurred
prior to the Closing Date, or (B)  illegal acts, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of CEM or CPI prior to  the  Closing Date; and

 

 

(iii) Liabilities  and obligations arising at anytime under the Excluded
Agreements.

 

 

(i) For  purposes of determining the amount of Indemnifiable Losses arising
from a breach  of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
Parties to this  Agreement, but not for purposes of determining whether any
such representation,  warranty, covenant or obligation has been breached or
is inaccurate, limitations  or qualifications as to dollar amount,
materiality or Material Adverse Effect  (or similar concept) set forth in
such representation, warranty, covenant or  obligation shall be disregarded.

 

 

8.2 _Defense  of Claims_.

 

 

(a) If  any  Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of
the commencement  of any claim, action, or proceeding made or brought by any
Person who is not  a  party to this Agreement or any Affiliate of a Party to
this Agreement (a "Third  Party Claim") with respect to which indemnification
is to be sought from an  Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee shall give such
Indemnifying Party reasonably  prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event such notice shall not be given  later than ten (10) calendar days after
the Indemnitee's receipt of written  notice of such Third Party Claim. Such
notice shall describe the nature of  the  Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail and shall indicate the estimated amount,  if practicable, of the
Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained  by  the Indemnitee.
The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in  or,  by giving
written notice to the Indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense  of  any
Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense and by such 
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, provided that the counsel for the
Indemnifying  Party who shall conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim
shall be  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee shall
cooperate in  good faith in such defense at such Indemnitee's own expense. If
an Indemnifying  Party elects not to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnitee  may compromise or settle such Third Party Claim over
the objection of the  Indemnifying Party, which settlement or compromise
shall conclusively establish  the Indemnifying Party's liability pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

 

(b) If,  within ten (10) calendar days after an Indemnitee provides written
notice to  the  Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claims, the Indemnitee
receives written  notice from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying
Party has elected  to  assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 8.2(a),  the  Indemnifying Party will not be liable for
any legal expenses subsequently  incurred by the Indemnitee in connection
with the defense thereof for so long  as  the Indemnifying Party shall
continue the diligent defense of such Third Party  Claim. Without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying  Party shall not enter
into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which would  lead to liability
or create any financial or other obligation or restriction  on  the part of
the Indemnitee. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party  Claim would
not lead to liability or the creation of a financial or other  obligation or
restriction on the part of the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying  Party desires
to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall  give written
notice to the Indemnitee to that effect. If the Indemnitee fails  to 
consent to such firm offer within ten (10) calendar days after its receipt 
of  such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations
to  defend such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee may contest or defend
such  Third Party Claim. In such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying  Party as to such Third Party Claim will be the amount of such
settlement offer  plus reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by
Indemnitee up to the  date  of said notice.

 

 

(c) Any  claim  by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss which
does not result  from  a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by giving the  Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, stating the nature  of such claim in reasonable detail and
indicating the estimated amount, if  practicable, but in any event such
notice shall not be given later than ten  (10)  calendar days after the
Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct Claim, and  the  Indemnifying Party
shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days within  which  to respond
to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond  within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be  deemed to
have accepted such claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to accept  such
claim, the Indemnitee will be free to seek enforcement of its right to 
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) If  the  amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the
making of an  indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery,
settlement or  otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim,  recovery, settlement or payment by, from or against
any other entity, the amount  of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or
premiums incurred in connection  therewith (together with interest thereon
from the date of payment thereof  at  the publicly announced prime rate then
in effect as published in the Wall Street  Journal shall promptly be repaid
by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying  Party.

 

 

(e) A  failure  to give timely notice as provided in this Section 8.2 shall
not affect the  rights or obligations of any Party hereunder except if, and
only to the extent  that, as a result of such failure, the Party which was
entitled to receive  such  notice was actually prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that
(i) Seller shall be  entitled exclusively to control, defend and settle any
litigation,  administrative or regulatory proceeding arising out of or
related to any  Excluded Liabilities, and Buyer agrees to cooperate fully at
Seller's expense in  connection therewith and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled
exclusively to control,  defend and settle any litigation, administrative or
regulatory proceeding,  arising out of or related to any Guarantee
Liabilities, and Seller agrees to  cooperate fully at Buyer's expense in
connection therewith.

 

 

8.3 _Survival_.   The  representations and warranties given or made by any
Party to this Agreement  or  in any certificate or other writing furnished
in connection herewith shall  survive the Closing for a period of 575 days
after the Closing Date and shall  thereafter terminate and be of no further
force or effect, except that (i)  the  Seller Fundamental Representations
and the Buyer Fundamental Representations  shall survive indefinitely, (ii)
all representations and warranties relating  to  Sections 4.11 and 4.20(h)
shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty  (30)  days following the
applicable statutes of limitation taking into account any  extensions or
waivers thereof, and (iii) the representations and warranties  in  Section
4.20(n) shall survive the Closing for a period of 36 months after the 
Closing Date.

 

 

The  covenants and obligations of Seller and Buyer set forth in this
Agreement,  including without limitation the indemnification obligations of
the Parties  under Article VIII hereof, shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, and each  Party shall be entitled to the full performance
thereof by the other Party  hereto without limitation as to time or amount
(except as otherwise specifically  set forth herein).

 

 

**ARTICLE  IX**

 

 

**TERMINATION**

 

 

9.1 _Termination_.

 

 

(a) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date
by mutual  written consent of Seller and Buyer.

 

 

(b) This  Agreement may be terminated by Seller or Buyer if (i) any Federal
or state  court  of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order,
judgment or decree  permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Closing, and  such order, judgment or decree shall have
become final and nonappealable or  (ii)  any statute, rule, order or
regulation shall have been enacted or issued by  any  Governmental Authority
which, directly or indirectly, prohibits the consummation  of the Closing; or
(iii) the Closing contemplated hereby shall have not occurred  on or before
the day which is 120 days from the date of this Agreement (the  "Termination
Date"), provided, however, that so long as such Party has complied  with
Section 6.5 of this Agreement, the Termination Date (x) may be extended  by 
Buyer for up to thirty (30) days if any of Buyer Required Regulatory
Approvals  shall not have been obtained and (y) may be extended by Seller for
up to thirty  (30) days if any of Seller Required Regulatory Approvals shall
not have been  obtained; and provided, further, that the right to terminate
this Agreement  under this Section 9.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to any
Party whose failure  to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or  resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such  date.

 

 

(c) So  long  as such Party has complied with Section 6.5 of this Agreement,
this Agreement  may be terminated by Buyer if any of Buyer Required
Regulatory Approvals, the  receipt of which is a condition to the obligation
of Buyer to consummate the  Closing as set forth in Section 7.1(c), shall
have been denied (and a petition  for rehearing or refiling of an application
initially denied without prejudice  shall also have been denied) or shall
have been granted but contains terms  or  conditions which do not satisfy
the closing condition in Section 7.1(c). 

 

 

(d) So  long  as such Party has complied with Section 6.5 of this Agreement,
this Agreement  may be terminated by Seller, if any of Seller's Required
Regulatory Approvals,  the receipt of which is a condition to the obligation
of Seller to consummate  the Closing as set forth in Section 7.2(c), shall
have been denied (and a  petition for rehearing or refiling of an application
initially denied without  prejudice shall also have been denied) or shall
have been granted but contains  terms or conditions which do not satisfy the
closing condition in Section  7.2(c).

 

 

(e) This  Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if there has been a material
violation  or  breach by Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this  Agreement which has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect
and such violation  or  breach is not cured by the earlier of the Closing
Date or the date thirty (30)  days after receipt by Seller of notice
specifying particularly such violation  or  breach, and such violation or
breach has not been waived by Buyer.

 

 

(f) This  Agreement may be terminated by Seller, if there has been a material
violation  or  breach by Buyer of any covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this  Agreement and such violation or breach is not cured by the
earlier of the  Closing Date or the date thirty (30) days after receipt by
Buyer of notice  specifying particularly such violation or breach, and such
violation or breach  has not been waived by Seller.

 

 

(g) This  Agreement may be terminated by Seller if either the Equity
Commitment Letter  or  the Buyer LC shall no longer remain in full force and
effect.

 

 

9.2 _Procedure  and Effect of No-Default Termination_.   In  the  event of
termination of this Agreement by either or both of the Parties pursuant  to
Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the 
terminating Party to the other Party, whereupon, if this Agreement is
terminated  pursuant to any of Sections 9.1(a) through (d), the liabilities
of the Parties  hereunder will terminate, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this  Agreement, and thereafter neither Party shall have any
recourse against the  other by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

9.3 _Termination  Fee; Letter of Credit_.   Seller  may immediately draw
upon the Buyer LC in an amount equal to $50 million (the  "Termination Fee")
if this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to  Sections 9.1(b)(iii),
9.1(f) or 9.1(g); provided, that Seller shall not be  in  breach of this
Agreement in such a manner that would entitle Buyer to terminate  this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(e), and provided further, that  in 
the case of termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), the failure of the 
Closing Date to occur was due to the breach by Buyer of its obligations to 
complete the transactions contemplated hereby when required to do so in 
accordance with this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if
Seller  shall terminate this Agreement as provided immediately above,
Seller's damages  would be difficult or impossible to quantify with
reasonable certainty, and  accordingly the payment provided for in this
Section 9.3 is a payment of  liquidated damages (and not penalties) which is
a based on the Parties' estimate  of the damages Seller will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving  rise  to such payment and the resultant
termination of this Agreement. Buyer  irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defense that any such  liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties  agree that the right to receive
payment of the amount determined pursuant to  this Section 9.3 in the manner
provided herein is the sole and exclusive remedy  of Seller. There shall be
no liability of any shareholder, partner, member,  director, officer,
employee, advisor or representative of Buyer or Seller or  any  Affiliate
thereof, whether to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or any other  Person
(including any shareholder, partner, member, director, officer, employee, 
advisor or representative thereof) in connection with any liability or other 
obligation of Buyer or Seller or any Affiliate thereof, whether hereunder or 
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
