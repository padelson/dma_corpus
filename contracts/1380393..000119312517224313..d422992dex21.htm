Section 1.5(a)) or one Business Day prior to the Closing Date (in the case of
the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule and the calculation to be
delivered pursuant to clause (i) and clause (iii), respectively, of this
Section 1.5(a)), the Sellers shall prepare in good faith and deliver to the
Buyers:

 

(i) a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the
Closing Revenue Run-Rate in a form consistent with _Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_ of
the Company Group Disclosure Schedule with the calculation for each Client in
a manner consistent with the calculation, without duplication, in respect of
such Client (or Committed Flows Client, as applicable) of the Base Revenue
Run-Rate (the " _Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule_");

 



3 (ii) an unaudited statement (the " _Estimated Working Capital Statement_ ")
which shall set forth the Sellers estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital
and its calculation thereof; and

 

(iii) a calculation of the Closing Payment Amount based on the foregoing and
the adjustments described in  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
deliver to the Buyers (x) an updated Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule
setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Closing Revenue Run-
Rate reflecting any Client Consents that have been obtained from and after
the date on which such schedule was initially delivered to the Buyers through
5:00 p.m. New York time on such Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date and (y) an updated calculation of the Closing Payment Amount based on
the foregoing and the adjustments described in _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, if

(b) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Buyers and their representatives
will be given reasonable access to the Company Books and Records relating to
the preparation of the Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule and the Estimated

revisions to the foregoing and the calculation of the Closing Payment Amount
proposed by the Sellers. The Sellers and the Buyers will work prior to
Closing to resolve any disputes with respect to the Closing Revenue Run-Rate
Schedule and the Estimated Working Capital Statement and any such resolutions
shall be reflected therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Buyers and
the Sellers cannot resolve any such dispute prior to the Closing Date, the
Closing Revenue Run-Rate Schedule and the Estimated Working Capital Statement
proposed by the Sellers shall be binding for purposes of determining the
payments to be made by the Buyers at the Closing in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 1.4_.

 

Section 1.6 _Closing Date Adjustments_.

 

(a) If the Closing Revenue Run-Rate (as determined based on the Closing
Revenue Run-Rate Schedule) is less than the product of (x) the Threshold
Percentage and (y) the Base Revenue Run-Rate, then the Closing Payment Amount
shall be reduced by the Reduction Amount.

(b) In addition to any adjustment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, if
the Sellers estimate of Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the
Estimated Working Capital Statement) is (i) less than the Closing Net Working
Capital Target, the Closing Payment Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital Target exceeds the
estimate of Closing Net Working Capital and (ii) greater than the Closing Net
Working Capital Target, the Closing Payment Amount shall be increased by an
amount equal to the amount by which the estimate of Closing Net Working
Capital exceeds the Closing Net Working Capital Target.

 



4 Section 1.7 _Post-Closing Adjustments and Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in no event more
than 90 days thereafter, the Buyers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Sellers an unaudited statement (the " _Post-Closing
Adjustments Statement_ "), which shall set forth the Buyers calculation of
(i) the Closing Revenue Run-Rate (the " _Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate_"),
and (ii) the Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Final Working Capital_ ").

 

(b) Each calculation of the Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate and the Final
Working Capital is referred to herein as a " _Calculation_." Each Calculation
shall be accompanied by such supporting work papers as may be deemed necessary
to an understanding of the Calculation. In connection with the preparation and
review of any Calculation, each of the Sellers and the Buyers shall promptly
deliver to the other such additional information regarding the Calculation as
may be reasonably requested by such party.

 

(c) The Buyers agree that upon reasonable prior notice during normal business
hours they shall afford the Sellers and their accountants and other
authorized representatives, during the period from the delivery of each
Calculation until the resolution thereof, access to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company Group, and to the
contracts, books, records, documents, data and such other information of the
Company Group as may reasonably be requested in connection with reviewing each
Calculation.

 

(d) The Sellers shall have 60 days after the day of receipt of the Post-
Closing Adjustments Statement to notify the Buyers if they object to any
Calculation. Any such notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") shall specify each
item or amount in dispute (a " _Disputed Item_ "), together with a written
explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such Disputed Item and
shall set forth the Sellers alternative calculation of the Calculation based
on such objections. To the extent not set forth in the Dispute Notice, the
Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with the calculation of all other items
and amounts contained in the Calculation. Any Disputed Item shall be resolved
in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.7(f)_ hereof.

 

(e) If either (i) the Sellers do not deliver to the Buyers a Dispute Notice
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(d)_ within 60 days after the date of receipt
of the Post-Closing Adjustments Statement or (ii) the Sellers and the Buyers
acknowledge in writing that the Calculation is accurate, the Calculation shall
be final and binding on all parties.

 

(f) If the Sellers and the Buyers are unable in good faith to resolve any
Disputed Item within 45 days after delivery of a Dispute Notice pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(d)_, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the
other, will jointly retain a Firm to resolve any remaining disagreements. If
the Sellers and the Buyers are unable to agree on the choice of the Firm, the
Firm will be a "Big Four" accounting firm (or successor thereof) selected by
lot (after excluding any Firm that is not independent from the parties hereto
and their respective Affiliates). In the event that all "Big Four" accounting
firms are excluded, the Firm will be a Designated Firm (or successor thereof)
selected by lot excluding any Firm that is not independent from the parties
hereto and their respective Affiliates. The Firm or Designated Firm, as the
case may be, shall, within 60 days following its selection, deliver to the
Sellers and the Buyers a written report determining such Disputed Items (and
only such Disputed Items), and its determinations will be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto for the purposes of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price, absent manifest error. The Sellers and the Buyers shall
cooperate with the Firm

 



5 or Designated Firm, as the case may be, and make available their respective
employees and any books and records in their respective possession that the
Firm or Designated Firm, as the case may be, reasonably determines are
necessary in making its determination. With respect to each Disputed Item, the
Firm or Designated Firm, as the case may be, shall not render a determination
that is higher than the amount advocated by the Sellers or lower than the
amount advocated by the Buyers. The fees and disbursements of the Firm or
Designated Firm, as the case may be, shall be allocated and be paid by
the Buyers, on the one hand, and/or the Sellers, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the disputes not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party (which allocation
shall be included in the Firms or Designated Firms, as the case may be,
decision). For example, if the Sellers claim that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Buyers and if the Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Sellers $300 of the $1,000
contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated 30%
(i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Buyers and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to the Sellers.

 

Section 1.8 _Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment_. Within 10 Business Days
following the final determination of all of the Calculations, the following
payments shall be made:

(a) The calculation made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ shall be redone
by substituting Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate for Closing Revenue Run-Rate
(the " _Substitute Calculation_ ").

 

(i) If there was a reduction to the Closing Payment Amount pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ at the Closing and the Substitute Calculation results
in a reduction to the Closing Payment Amount that is greater than the
reduction at the Closing calculated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, then
the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers an amount equal to the difference between
(i) the reduction to the Closing Payment Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.6(a)_ calculated using the Substitute Calculation and (ii) the reduction to
the Closing Payment Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ calculated at
the Closing using the Closing Revenue Run-Rate.

 

(ii) If there was a reduction to the Closing Payment Amount pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ at the Closing and the Substitute Calculation results
in a reduction to the Closing Payment Amount that is less than the reduction
calculated at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ but still
results in a reduction to the Closing Payment Amount, then the Buyers shall
pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the difference between (1) the reduction

a " _Contingent Client_ ") continues to accept investment advisory services
provided by the Company Group through the date that is 120 days following the

each Contingent Client (and shall not permit any such relationship to be
transferred from the Company Group to any of the Buyers and their Affiliates
(other than the Company Group)) and (y) not take any action the sole purpose

soon as reasonably practicable (and in no case later than five Business Days
prior to the Closing) if the Buyers intend to withhold amounts pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.10_ (other than on account of the Sellers failure to

where it is required to be so qualified under Applicable Law, except where any

Regulations_ ")) holds any equity interests, whether such Private Fund, at
any time, (w) holds or held plan assets, (x) does not hold and has not held
plan assets by reason of being a "venture capital operating company," (y) does
not hold and has not held plan assets by reason of being a "real estate

Regulations, and, in each case, in addition, sets forth whether the
Organizational Documents of such Private Fund permit such Private Fund to hold
plan assets in the future. 

(h) No "disqualifying event" under Rule 506(d) of the Securities Act relating
to the Sellers, any member of the Company Group, any Affiliate of any member
of the Company Group or any officers or directors of any member of the Company
Group, any placement agent (or any beneficial owner of 20% or more of such
placement agents voting securities) or its employees,
agents, representatives and/or officers or directors, any beneficial owner of
20% or more of any Company Group members or Sponsored Private Funds voting

Section 5.2 _Client Consents_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause
to be obtained, (i) the necessary approval of the Public Fund Board and (ii)
(A) in the case of each Public Fund designated in _Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_ of
the Company Group Disclosure Schedule as having " _Manager of Managers Relief_
," the approval of the principal investment adviser to such Public Fund, or
(B) in the case of each Public Fund not so designated, the approval of the
shareholders

 



29  of such Public Fund, in each case in accordance with the provisions of
Section 15 of the Investment Company Act applicable thereto and any applicable
SEC exemptive orders, of a new Advisory Agreement relating to such Public
Fund, with such agreement becoming effective immediately following the Closing
and containing material terms that are, taken as a whole, substantially
similar to the terms of the applicable existing Advisory Agreement with such
Public Fund. In the event that the approval of the shareholders of a Public
Fund (if such shareholder approval is required under the Investment Company
Act and applicable SEC exemptive orders) of the applicable new
Advisory Agreement described in the foregoing sentences is not obtained prior
to the Closing, the Company may request the Public Fund Board of each such
Public Fund to approve, in conformity with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment
Company Act, an interim Advisory Agreement relating to such Public Fund, with
such agreement becoming effective immediately following the Closing and
containing material terms that are, taken as a whole, substantially similar to
the terms of the applicable existing Advisory Agreement with such Public Fund
(except for changes thereto to the extent necessary to comply with Rule 15a-4
under the Investment Company Act). The parties agree that approval for a
particular Public Fund (each, a " _Public Fund Approval_ ") shall be deemed
given for all purposes under this Agreement (including for the purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_) if (x) a new Advisory Agreement relating to such
Public Fund has been approved by the Public Fund Board and (in the case of a
Public Fund described in clause (ii)(A) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_) the
principal investment adviser to such Public Fund or (in the case of a Public
Fund described in clause (ii)(B) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_) the
shareholders of such Public Fund or (y) an interim Advisory Agreement relating
to such Public Fund has been approved, in each case in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_, unless prior to the Closing the applicable Public
Fund Board notifies the applicable member of the Company Group in writing that
the Public Fund has terminated its Advisory Agreement (and such notice is not
withdrawn).

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause
to be obtained, the approval of the new Advisory Agreement for the Logan

owns any shares in the Core Plus Fund shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, vote to approve such new Advisory Agreement, and neither Seller may
redeem, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to redeem, its shares
of the Core Plus Fund prior to any such vote. Promptly following such vote,
and in any event no later than 10 Business Days following the Closing, the
Company Buyer shall cause all of the shares of the Core Plus Fund held by the
Sellers and their Affiliates to be redeemed in full, in cash, in accordance
with the terms of the Core Plus Fund.

(c) Within five Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall send
to each Separate Account Client a notice substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Schedule F_ , requesting that such Separate Account Client consent
in writing to the "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Advisers Act) of
its Advisory Agreement resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and, in the case of a Separate Account Client that is
Negative Consent Eligible, stating that such Clients consent will be deemed
given if such Client does not object by the means and within the period
specified in such notice (a " _Separate Account Client Consent Request Notice_
"). If a particular Separate Account Client does not respond to the applicable
initial Separate Account Client Consent Request Notice within 30 days of the
sending of such notice, the Company shall send a second Separate Account
Client Consent Request

 



30  Notice to such Client. The parties agree that consent of a particular
Separate Account Client (each, a " _Separate Account Client Consent_ ") shall
be deemed obtained for all purposes under this Agreement (including for the
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_) if the written consent requested in the
applicable Separate Account Client Consent Request Notice(s) has been received
by the Company Group or, in the case of an Advisory Agreement that is
Negative Consent Eligible, such Client does not object by the means and within
the period specified in the applicable Separate Account Client Consent Request
Notice(s) (a " _Separate Account Negative Consent Period_ ") and continues to
accept investment advisory services from the Company Group during the
applicable Separate Account Negative Consent Period; _provided_ that no
Separate Account Client shall be deemed to have given consent for any purpose
under this Agreement if at any time prior to the Closing such Separate Account
Client notifies the Company Group orally or in writing that such Separate
Account Client has not so consented or has terminated, or intends
to terminate, its Advisory Agreement or intends to withdraw all of its assets
under management by the Company Group (and such notice is not withdrawn or
superseded).

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause
to be obtained, consents from or in respect of each Private Fund to the
"assignment" (as defined in the Investment Advisers Act) of its Advisory
Agreement resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby if and to the extent required by the terms of such Advisory Agreement,

hereto as _Schedule G_ (each, a " _Private Fund Consent Request Notice_ "),
the first at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date and the second, if
applicable, approximately 30 days after the first, informing such Private
Fund or such investor (as applicable) of the transactions contemplated hereby
and requesting the appropriate consent to the assignment of such Advisory
Agreement. The parties agree that consent from or in respect of a particular
Private Fund (each, a " _Private Fund Consent_ ") shall be deemed obtained for
all purposes under this Agreement (including for the purposes of _Section_ __
_ 6.1(c)_) if (x) the consent requested in the applicable Private Fund
Consent Request Notice(s) has been received by the Company Group from such
Private Fund (or, if such Private Fund is a Sponsored Private Fund or Private-
Label Private Fund, a majority-in-interest of the investors (or other greater
applicable percentage specified in the Advisory Agreement, Organizational
Documents and/or Applicable Law) in such Private Fund who are not
Affiliates or employees of the Company Group or its Affiliates (or, if each
of the investors in such Private Fund is an Affiliate or employee of the
Company Group or its Affiliates, then a majority-in-interest of such
investors)), (y) in the case of an Advisory Agreement that is Negative Consent
Eligible, such Private Fund or, if such Private Fund is a Sponsored Private

the means and within the period specified in such Private Fund Consent
Request Notice(s) (a " _Private Fund Negative Consent Period_ "), or (z) in
the case of each Private Fund set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ of the
Company Group Disclosure Schedule, the consent has been given in the manner
specified in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule.
To the extent that the consent of any Affiliate of any member of the Company
Group is required for the "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Advisers
Act) of the Advisory Agreements resulting from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(a)_ with respect to any
Private Fund, the Company shall cause such Affiliates to provide such consent
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

(e) The Company shall take reasonable steps to keep the Buyers reasonably
informed of the status of the Companys efforts to obtain the Client Consents
to be requested under this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_. The Buyers shall have the
reasonable opportunity to review drafts of any proxy solicitation and other
consent request materials (including the Separate Account Client Consent
Request Notices and the Private Fund Consent Request Notices) contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ in advance of dissemination of such materials to
the applicable recipients thereof, and shall have their reasonable comments to
such drafts reviewed in good faith prior to such dissemination. Each of the
Buyers and Parent Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Company Group in
connection with the obtaining of Client Consents under this _Section_ __ _
5.2_. The Company shall provide the Buyers with (i) within two Business Days
following the 1st and 15th day of each month, copies of all written Client

documentation and other evidence as the Buyers reasonably request to confirm
that the requisite Client Consents have been obtained for purposes of this
Agreement.

(f) Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company,

directors, officers or agents shall, directly or indirectly, contact or
communicate with any Client, any investor in a Client, any Affiliate of

or trustees of any Fund) or any consultant to or representative of a Client or
any such investor or any similar Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyers shall give prompt notice to the
Company of any inquiry or other communication received by a Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof from any Client, any investor in a Client, any Affiliate of
a Client or any such investor (including any member of the board of directors
or trustees of any Fund) or any consultant to or representative of any Client
or any such investor or any similar Person regarding the transactions

Section 5.3 _Pre-Closing Access_.

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company and the
General Partner shall provide such access to the Buyers and their respective
representatives, employees and agents to all information and data relating to

otherwise relating to the financial and legal condition of the Company

 



32  Group, as is reasonably requested in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated in connection herewith
and therewith, subject to compliance with Applicable Law. Such review shall
occur only during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice by
either Buyer to the Company and shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_, neither the Company nor the General Partner shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would reasonably be expected to: (i) violate the terms of any duty of
confidentiality owed to any Person (whether such duty arises contractually,
statutorily or otherwise) or any Contract with a third party ( _provided_ that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or develop an
alternative method of providing such information to the requesting Buyer);
(ii) waive or jeopardize any privileges, including any attorney-client
privilege, or any work product protection ( _provided_ that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as

reasonable claim that such privilege or protection would be waived or lost
pursuant to such access or disclosure, or develop an alternative method of
providing such information to a Buyer); (iii) violate any Applicable Law or
fiduciary duty; (iv) require access to competitively or commercially
sensitive information or information relating to the analysis or consideration
of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Sellers and their Affiliates or

the rights of the Company or the General Partner prior to the Closing to have
full and unlimited access to all aspects of the Company Groups assets,
facilities, contracts, business, operations and all other matters relating to
the Company Group. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any
disclosure to either Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ to the extent
such access or information is reasonably relevant or pertinent to any
litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
either Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties.

(b) All requests for information made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_
shall be directed to such person or persons as shall be designated in writing
by the Sellers. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, none of the

Group shall be obligated to make any work papers available to any Person under
this Agreement unless and until such person has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or
independent accountants.

necessary or appropriate in connection with any Proceeding arising out of any
business or operations of the Company Group in which the Sellers or the
Buyers, as applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates are or may from
time to time be involved, other than with respect to Proceedings involving
disputes between the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers or their
Affiliates, on the other hand; _provided_ that such cooperation would not
interfere with the operations of the Company Group or the Sellers and their
Affiliates, as applicable;

 



34 _provided_ that the Sellers shall be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by the Buyers and their Affiliates and the
Buyers shall be responsible for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the Sellers and their Affiliates, in each case in
connection with their compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_,

(a) The parties agree to be bound by and comply with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of which are hereby incorporated herein by
reference. The parties further agree that, upon the occurrence of the Closing,

their Affiliates (including the Company Group) prior to the Closing
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement from and after the Closing, which the parties agree (on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates party thereto, as applicable) shall
automatically be deemed amended, effective upon the occurrence of the
Closing, to extend the term thereof for a period of two years from the Closing

parties hereto shall consult with each other as to the form, substance and
timing of any press release or other public disclosure related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such press release

Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be restricted from making (and shall
not be required to notify any Person, including the Buyers and their
Affiliates, in connection with) any disclosure to any Governmental Authority

Affiliates to engage in ordinary course activities, including ordinary
trading, asset management, asset backed lending, investment banking,
financing, capital markets, loan origination, research and
arbitrage activities; _provided_ that prior to the Closing (and then solely

and filings and to obtain all approvals, consents, waivers and authorizations
that are necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including the Canadian Regulatory Approvals. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto shall make or have made (i) any applicable premerger
notification and report form filing under the HSR Act within ten Business Days
hereof and the filing parties shall request early termination of the
applicable HSR Act waiting period, and (ii) all filings in respect of the
Canadian Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than ten Business Days, following the date that the Buyers and their
Affiliates provide all information required for such Canadian Regulatory
Approval filings. The parties hereto agree to take all reasonable steps
necessary or advisable to satisfy any conditions or requirements imposed by
any Governmental Authority in connection with any such applications, notices,
petitions and filings or approvals, consents, waivers and authorizations or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements. The parties agree, and shall cause their applicable
Affiliates, to provide, promptly after the date hereof, all information
reasonably required for inclusion in any application or filing contemplated
hereby. The parties hereto will have the right to review in advance, and will
consult with the other parties on, all the information relating to the Company

case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and each party
will consider in good faith the suggestions of the other parties with respect
to any such filings and written materials. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
applications, notices, petitions and filings or approvals, consents, waivers
and authorizations necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions

matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein. The Sellers and the Buyers shall share equally the filing fees
associated with any applicable premerger notification and report form filing
required under the HSR Act and any filings required under any foreign
investment or competition law.

 



37 (b) Without limiting the generality of the Buyers undertaking pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, each of the Buyers shall use its reasonable best
efforts and take any and all steps necessary or advisable to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Applicable Law or in connection with any other legal requirement,
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other party so as to

winding-up or disposition of such of its assets, properties or businesses or
of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto,
and the entrance into such other arrangements, as are necessary or advisable
in order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of delaying in any material respect or preventing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, each of
the Buyers shall use its best efforts to defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to
the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such litigation in no way
limits the obligation of either Buyer to use its best efforts, and to take
any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under
Applicable Law to close the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the
Termination Date.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not apply to the
parties rights and obligations regarding Client approvals and consents in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (which rights and
obligations are governed by _Section_ __ _ 5.2_).

 

Section 5.7 _Insurance_. The Company and the General Partner shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect until the Closing Date (and the
Company Group will pay all premiums due thereon), the insurance policies and
fidelity bonds listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.18_ of the Company Group Disclosure
Schedule, or use reasonable best efforts to procure comparable replacement
policies and bonds (or such replacement coverage as is obtainable) and
maintain such policies and bonds in effect until the Closing. From and after
the Closing, the Company Group and the Funds shall cease to be insured by
any insurance policy or bond held by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than
a member of the Company Group), or by any of their self-insured programs, and
neither the Buyers nor any Affiliate thereof (including, after the Closing,
the Company Group) nor the Funds shall have any access, right, title or
interest to or in any such insurance policy, bond or self-insured program
(including all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to
cover the Company Group or any Fund for any loss arising from the operation
and activities of the Company Group or any Fund. From and after the Closing,
the Buyers shall be responsible for all insurance and bonds necessary or
appropriate for the operation and activities of the Company Group and the
Funds. The Buyers agree not to seek to assert or to exercise any other rights
or claims of the Company Group or any Fund thereof under or in respect of any
past or current insurance policy, bond or self-insurance program of Sellers
and their Affiliates thereof under which the Company Group or any Fund
thereof was or is insured, except in connection with the insurance coverage
required by _Section_ __ _ 5.18(c)_.

 

Section 5.8 _Expenses_. The Sellers shall bear and pay the fees, costs and
expenses (including any fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, financial advisors and other representatives) incurred by them
and their Affiliates (including any such out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by members of the Company Group prior to the Closing) in

 



38  connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, _provided_ that (a) the Buyers shall bear and pay all
fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors and
other representatives, and the proxy solicitation, printing and mailing costs,
if any, relating to obtaining the consents in respect of Public Funds
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)_ and (b) the Sellers and the Buyers
shall share equally the costs and expenses incurred (i) in order to obtain
consent to (1) the assignment of any Contract (other than an Advisory
Agreement) that is assigned, and (2) the change of control of the Company as
required by any Contract (other than an Advisory Agreement), in each case by
operation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(ii) as a result of the early termination (if any) by the Company Group of the
Contract set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ of the Company Group Disclosure
Schedule. The Buyers shall bear the fees, costs and expenses (including any
fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors and
other representatives) incurred by them and their Affiliates (including any
such fees, costs and expenses incurred by members of the Company Group
following the Closing) in connection with the negotiation and preparation of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

Section 5.9 _Further Assurances_. Each party to this Agreement shall, and
shall cause its Controlled Affiliates to, at the request of any other party,
at any time and from time to time following the Closing Date, execute and
deliver to the requesting party such further instruments and take such other
actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to confirm
and assure the rights of the parties hereunder and under the Ancillary
Agreements, or otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 5.10 _Ancillary Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, each of the
parties hereto shall execute and deliver (and, if applicable, cause their
relevant Affiliate party thereto to execute and deliver) to the other parties
(to the extent not executed and delivered at or prior to the execution hereof)
each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is to be a party pursuant
hereto.

Section 5.11 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Not later than 30 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company
Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make a written offer of
employment to each Business Employee to become employed by the Company Buyer
or one of its Affiliates as of the Closing in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, conditioned upon such
Business Employee satisfactorily completing the Company Buyers customary
onboarding process and standards. Each such Business Employee who accepts such
offer of employment and commences employment with the Company Buyer or one of
its Affiliates as of the Closing is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Transferred Employee_." Subject to any requirements under Applicable Law,
each Transferred Employee shall cease to participate in the Benefit
Plans effective as of the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
otherwise stated or provided, no Business Employee will be deemed a
Transferred Employee or an employee of the Company Buyer or one of its
Affiliates until the Closing.

 



39 (b) Notwithstanding anything set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ to
the contrary, and subject to Applicable Law, the Company Buyer shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make a written offer of employment to
each Business Employee who is on an approved leave of absence or receiving
income replacement benefits under a Benefit Plan that is a short- or long-
term disability plan as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Delayed Transfer Employee_ "), and who returns to active service and is able
to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable
accommodation within six months after the Closing Date, effective upon such
date as the Company Buyer or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, shall
determine, and conditioned upon such Business Employee satisfactorily
completing the Company Buyers customary onboarding process and standards.
Each Delayed Transfer Employee who accepts such offer shall become a
Transferred Employee on such date as the Delayed Transfer Employee is eligible
to return to active service and commences employment with the Company Buyer
or one of its Affiliates, as applicable (such Delayed Transfer Employees "
_Transfer Date_ "). With respect to each Business Employee who becomes
employed by the Company Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.11(a)_, such Business Employees Transfer Date shall be the Closing
Date.

 

(c) The written offer of employment made to each Business Employee pursuant to
either _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_ or _(b)_ , shall be made on terms and
conditions that, if the offer is declined by the Business Employee, the
Business Employee shall not have suffered an "employment loss" for purposes of
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar state or
local law. The Company Buyer shall provide the document substantially in the
form attached as _Schedule H_ hereto to each Business Employee at the same
time as it provides the written offer of employment in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(c)_.

(d) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
the first anniversary of the Closing Date and the date of termination of the
Transferred Employees employment with the Company Buyer and its Affiliates,
the Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide each
Transferred Employee with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate and annual
incentive compensation opportunity that are in the aggregate no less favorable
than the aggregate base salary or hourly wage rate and annual incentive
compensation opportunity (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
incentive compensation opportunity under the LTIP) provided to the Transferred
Employee by the Employer Entity immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate than the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of the Company
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable.

(e) The Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide
each Transferred Employee with full credit for such Transferred Employees
service with the Employer Entity and its Affiliates (and their respective
predecessors) prior to the Closing for purposes of (i) eligibility to
participate in any benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company Buyer
(each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") in which such Transferred Employee would otherwise
be required to complete a specified amount of service with the Company Buyer
prior to participation and (ii) the determination of the level of benefits
under a Buyer Plan for purposes of vacation and the calculation of severance
pay, but not including long-term incentive awards, retirement benefits
pursuant to any defined benefit retirement plan or post-employment medical or
non-medical insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. With respect to each Buyer Plan that is a health or
welfare plan, the Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its 

 



40  Affiliates to, (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of
such Transferred Employees due to pre-existing conditions, waiting
periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of
good health and (ii) allow for each such Transferred Employee to apply all
deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such Transferred
Employee under any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing during the year in which
the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
Transferred Employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and whether such
Transferred Employee has reached the out-of-pocket maximum for such year.

 

(f) Effective as of the Closing, and subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(l)_, the Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, have in effect a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement
plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning
of Section 401(k) of the Code in which each Transferred Employee shall be
eligible to participate (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). The Company Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, permit each Transferred
Employee to effect a direct rollover (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code and including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans) of such
Transferred Employees balance (including after-tax employee contributions)
under the Employer Entitys Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the " _Employer
Entity 401(k) Plan_ ") to the Buyer 401(k) Plan at any time on or after
Closing. The Company Buyer and the Employer Entity shall cooperate to take
any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit each Transferred
Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Employer Entity 401(k)
Plan as of the Closing to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the
Employer Entity 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and
in-kind rollover of the notes evidencing such loans from the Employer Entity
401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan so as to prevent, to the extent
reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such
outstanding loans.

 

(g) Effective as of the Closing, the Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to, have in effect a flexible spending account plan in
which the Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate (the " _Buyer
FSA Plan_ "). The Buyer FSA Plan shall have terms and conditions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those set forth in the medical
and dependent care account plans sponsored by the Employer Entity in which
the Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing (each,
an " _Employer Entity FSA Plan_ "). All reimbursable expenses incurred by a
Transferred Employee prior to the Closing must be submitted to the applicable
Employer Entity FSA Plan, and the Buyer FSA Plan shall not be liable for any
such expenses incurred prior to the Closing.

 

(h) The Sellers shall retain or assume and be solely responsible for any and
all liabilities, whether known or unknown, relating to the employment,
service or termination of employment or services of the Business Employees,
Former Employees and any independent contractors who are individuals who
provide or provided services to the Sellers, the Company Group or their
respective Affiliates, including any and all liabilities relating to the
Sellers, the Company Groups or their respective Affiliates provision of
compensation and benefits to such Persons, in each case arising prior to the
applicable Business Employees transfer of employment from the Employer
Entity to the Company Buyer and its Affiliates (or, in the case of any Person
who does not become a Transferred Employee, arising at any time) and
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any liabilities arising from the
termination of any Business Employees

 



41  employment with the Employer Entity in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any liabilities arising
from any Benefit Plan. Effective as of each Transferred Employees transfer
of employment from the Employer Entity to the Company Buyer and its
Affiliates, the Company Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for any and all liabilities arising from such Transferred Employees
employment with the Company Buyer and its Affiliates.

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, pursuant to Section
8(b) of the LTIP, the LTIP shall terminate and the Sellers shall take any and
all steps necessary or advisable to effect such termination. The Sellers shall
retain or assume and be solely responsible for any and all liabilities
relating to the LTIP.

(j) The Company Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
establish a plan effective as of the Closing pursuant to which incentive
compensation awards with a total value equal to the Aggregate Buyer Payment
Plan Amount shall be granted, subject in all cases to eligibility, vesting,
forfeiture and settlement pursuant to the terms and conditions of
_Schedule I_ hereto to the individuals identified in _Schedule I_ hereto who
become Transferred Employees (the " _Buyer Payment Plan_ "). The receipt by
any participant in the Buyer Payment Plan of any portion of the award
thereunder that is payable in connection with the Closing shall be
conditioned upon such participants execution and non-revocation of an
effective general release of any and all claims that such participant may
have with respect to the Employer Entity and its Affiliates and the Company
Buyer and its Affiliates.

(k) The Buyers, the Company and the Employer Entity shall reasonably
cooperate after the date hereof to effectuate the provisions in this _Section_
__ _ 5.11_.

 

(l) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the Company Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any specific
individual. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to
any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to
employees prior to or following the Closing, (ii) confer upon or give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_) under
or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, or (iii) except as required
by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, prohibit or restrict the Company Buyer or any
of its Affiliates from terminating any employee benefit plan or other
arrangement providing for the compensation or benefits or other terms or
conditions of employment of any Transferred Employee or other employee at any
time.

(m) _Annex E_ to the Company Group Disclosure Schedule is hereby incorporated
herein by reference.

Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Sellers and
members of the Company Group, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other
hand, shall, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, give written notice to the
other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that has resulted in, or
would be reasonably likely to result in any condition to such other partys
obligations set forth in _Article VI_ to fail to be satisfied, at any time
from the date hereof to the Closing Date.

 



42 Section 5.13 _Termination of Affiliate Agreements; Cancellation of
Intercompany Receivables_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ of the Company Group
Disclosure Schedule, at or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and the
Company and the General Partner shall, and shall cause all members of the
Company Group to, terminate each of the Affiliate Agreements.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ of the Company Group
Disclosure Schedule, at or prior to the Closing, all intercompany
receivables, payables and loans between any member of the Company Group, on
the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company
Group), on the other hand, shall be settled, paid or, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, otherwise terminated or cancelled, with the result that
there shall not be any intercompany receivables, payables or loans between any
member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company Group), on the other hand, after the
Closing.

Section 5.14 _Release of Guarantees_.  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ of the Company
Group Disclosure Schedule sets forth all obligations of the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company Group) under, all guarantees, clawback
arrangements, keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity or contribution
agreements, support agreements, comfort letters, insurance surety bonds or
other contingent obligations in favor of any member of the Company Group
(collectively, the " _Seller Guarantees_ ") as of the date hereof. The Buyers
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, on or prior to the Closing, the
termination of, and full release of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Company Group) from all Seller Guarantees. Such efforts
shall include an offer by the Buyers and/or Parent Buyer (or with the
Sellers written consent by an Affiliate of the Buyers or by other Persons) to
replace or substitute its own obligations for those of the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than any member of the Company Group) under each Seller
Guarantee on terms no less favorable to the applicable counter party than
apply to the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company Group).
Following the Closing, if such replacement or substitution has not been
obtained in respect of a particular Seller Guarantee, the Buyers shall cause
the applicable members of the Company Group to terminate (if terminable) or
otherwise cause to be extinguished any Contract or other
obligation guaranteed or otherwise supported by such Seller Guarantee. From
and after the Closing, the Buyers, the Parent Buyer and the Company shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
Affiliates from and against any and all losses incurred by any of them
relating to the Seller Guarantees, and shall not permit any Contract or other
obligation guaranteed or otherwise supported by a Seller Guarantee to be
amended, modified or renewed without the prior written consent of the Sellers
in their sole discretion. The Buyers agree that, with respect to any Seller
Guarantee, their efforts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ shall include,
if requested, the execution and delivery by the Buyers, or by an affiliate of
the Buyers acceptable to the beneficiary of such Seller Guarantee, of a
replacement guarantee that is substantially in the form of such Seller
Guarantee. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining the
termination of, and release of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Company Group) from, the Seller Guarantees shall be borne by the Buyers.

 



43 Section 5.15 _Financial Information_. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide to the
Buyers, as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) Business
Days following the end of each calendar month, or, if later, within one (1)
Business Day after the same are available to the Company Group, financial
information regarding the Company Group in substantially the form set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_ of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule.

 

Section 5.16 _Section 15(f)_.

 

(a) Each Buyer acknowledges that each Seller and/or its Affiliates (as
applicable) are entering into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. The Buyers shall not take, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to take, any action that would have the effect, directly
or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the provisions of
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
shall not fail to take, and, after the Closing, shall cause their Affiliates
not to fail to take, any action within their control if the failure to take
such action would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the
requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act not to be met in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In that regard, each Buyer shall
conduct its business and shall cause each of its Affiliates to conduct its
business so as to assure (to the extent within their control) that:

(i) for a period of not less than three years after the Closing, at least 75%
of the members of the boards of directors or trustees of the Public Funds are
not (A) "interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the
Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser of the Public Funds after
the Closing or (B) "interested persons" (within the meaning of Section
2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser of the
Public Funds immediately prior to the Closing; and

(ii) for a period of not less than two years after the Closing, there shall
not be imposed on the Public Funds an "unfair burden" (as set forth and
described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, or
any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings applicable
thereto.

(b) For a period of three years from the Closing, each Buyer shall not engage,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that would
constitute an "assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) to a
third party of any Advisory Agreement between (i) either (A) a Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or (B) any member of the Company Group and (ii) any Public
Fund without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects the same as
that contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not apply in the event that Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
no longer applies to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the covenants of the parties hereto contained in this _Section_ __ _
5.16_ are intended only for the benefit of such parties and not for the
benefit of any other Person.

 



44 Section 5.17 _Services from Affiliates; Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) The Buyers acknowledge that the members of the Company Group currently
receive or benefit from certain management, administrative and corporate
services and benefits provided by or on behalf of the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company Group), including the Seller-Provided
Services, that all such services and benefits will cease upon the Closing and
that, following the Closing, except as expressly provided in this Agreement
or in the Transition Services Agreement, the Sellers and their Affiliates will
not have any obligation with respect to the provision of any services or other
benefits to or for the benefit of the Buyers and their Affiliates (including
the Company Group).

(b) The Buyers shall (in consultation with the Sellers, and the Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyers), (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain,
effective as of the Closing, the separation of each of the Contracts set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)(i)_ of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Shared Contracts_ ") into two contracts with the applicable
counterparty: one contract to which one or more of the Buyers and their
Affiliates (including the Company Group) are a party (with respect to any
services under such Shared Contract utilized by, and other matters under such
Shared Contract pertaining to, the Company Group), and one contract to which
one or more of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company
Group), as applicable, are a party (with respect to all other services and
matters under such Shared Contract), (ii) cause, effective as of the Closing,
the assumption of each of the Contracts set forth on _Section_ __ _
5.17(b)(ii)_ of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule (the " _Fortress-Level
Company Contracts_ ," and together with the Shared Contracts, the " _Covered
Contracts_ ") to Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the Company) and
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, effective upon the Closing, the
full release of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company
Group) from all obligations of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Company Group) under each such Covered Contract with respect to any
services under such Covered Contract, and other matters under such Covered
Contract, solely to the extent utilized by or pertaining to the Company Group.
Such efforts shall include an offer by the Buyers and/or Parent Buyer (or with
the Sellers written consent by an Affiliate of the Buyers or by other
Persons) to the applicable counterparty to enter into a separate contract or
assume such contract as contemplated by the preceding sentence on terms no
less favorable to the applicable Company Group members and such counterparty
than apply under the applicable Covered Contract (with respect to any services
under such Covered Contract utilized by, and other matters under such Covered
Contract pertaining to, the Company Group). To the extent that any Covered
Contract is not so separated or assumed, or such release is not obtained at or
prior to the Closing, then from and after the Closing, the Sellers
collectively and the Buyers collectively shall bear equally any costs,
expenses or liability incurred by any of them, to the extent arising from or
otherwise relating to any services under such Covered Contract utilized by, or
any other matters under such Covered Contract pertaining to, the Company
Group. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining the
separation or assumption of, and the release of the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Company Group) from obligations under, any Covered
Contract as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17(b)_ shall be borne
equally by the Sellers collectively and the Buyers collectively. Without
limitation of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
prior to the Closing the Buyers and their Affiliates (i) shall not, directly
or indirectly, contact or communicate with any counterparties under the
Covered Contracts with respect thereto without the prior approval of the
Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii)
shall include a representative of the Sellers in any communication or
discussion with any counterparties under the Covered Contracts with respect
thereto.

 



45 (c) The Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to terminate, effective as
of the Closing, the participation of any Company Group member in, or the
coverage of any Company Group member under, each of the Contracts set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 5.17(c)_ of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule, and no
Company Group member shall have any liability under any such Contract after
the Closing.

(d) The Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to transfer all
right, title and interest in and to each of the domain names listed in
Section 3.17 of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule to a member of the
Company Group prior to the Closing.

 

(e) The Sellers and the Buyers each shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consent of the sublandlord to the assignment of
the Agreement of Sublease, dated December 29, 2006, as amended or
supplemented, by and between Verizon Communications Inc. and Verizon Services
Corp., together as sublandlord, and the Company as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the
Sellers and their Affiliates (including the Company Group) nor the Buyers and
their Affiliates shall be required to make any payment or otherwise incur
any out-of-pocket cost or expense in connection with their respective efforts
to obtain such sublandlord consent.

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly set forth in _Article VI_
, the obligations of the Buyers to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not be conditioned upon the receipt of any third party consent,
or the separation, transfer or termination of any contract, including as set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_.

 

Section 5.18 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) The Buyers and the Parent Buyer agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of the members of the Company Group or
the Business Employees as provided in the respective certificates of
formation, operating agreements or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and/or any indemnification agreements or other similar agreements
of the members of the Company Group, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (but which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall apply to any
Persons who become directors or officers of the Company Group or the Business
Employees prior to the Closing), shall survive the Closing and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, it being agreed that
after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if
applicable (to the extent such rights to indemnification are available under
Applicable Law), and the Buyers and the Parent Buyer shall cause
the applicable members of the Company Group to perform the obligations
thereunder.

(b) In the event that any member of the Company Group or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving limited liability company or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, the Buyers and the Parent Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of such member of the Company Group assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_.

 



46 (c) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, the Buyers and
the Parent Buyer shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company Group or provide substitute
policies for the Company Group and their respective current and former
directors and officers and the Business Employees who are covered by the
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance policies currently
maintained by the Company Group and the Business Employees (or, in the case
of the Business Employees, the Employer Entity or any of its applicable
Affiliates) in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company Group with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing
(with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance), except that in no event shall the Buyers be required
to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy
year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company Group (or, in the case of the Business Employees, the Employer Entity
or any of its applicable Affiliates) prior to the date of this Agreement (the
" _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Buyers are unable to obtain the insurance
required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.18(c)_ it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for each year within such six-year period
for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance,
the Buyers may, at their option (in consultation with the Sellers) and at the
Buyers expense, purchase prepaid "tail" insurance, effective as of the
Closing, for the Company Group and their current and former directors and
officers and the Business Employees who are covered by the policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance currently maintained by the Company Group (or, in the case of the
Business Employees, the Employer Entity or any of its applicable Affiliates)
as of the date of this Agreement for a period of six years from the Closing,
such tail insurance to provide coverage in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies currently maintained by the Company Group (or, in
the case of the Business Employees, the Employer Entity or any of its
applicable Affiliates), with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Closing; _provided_ that in no event shall the
annualized cost of any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. The
Buyers and the Parent Buyer shall maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.18_: (i) shall survive the
Closing, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.19 _Parent Buyer_. Parent Buyer (if it is not the Company Buyer and
the GP Buyer) shall take all actions necessary to cause each of the Company
Buyer and the GP Buyer, as applicable, to perform its respective obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



47 Section 5.20 _Company Books and Records_. Except as set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.20_ or in _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ of the Company Group
Disclosure Schedule, any Company Books and Records that are in the possession
or control of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company Group)
immediately following the Closing shall, at the Companys sole option, be
promptly migrated to the Company, delivered to the address of the Company or
be held and maintained by the Sellers and their Affiliates (or any of them)
as an agent on behalf of the applicable member of the Company Group until the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to the following terms and
conditions (such retained books and records are collectively referred to
herein as the " _Stored Books and Records_ "):

(i) The Sellers shall use reasonable care to prevent the unauthorized
use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of any Stored Books and
Records; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers may destroy
Stored Books and Records pursuant to, and in accordance with, Applicable Law
and the document retention policies and procedures of the Sellers and their
Affiliates pertaining to information that is analogous to the Stored Books and
Records.

 

(ii) The Sellers shall only be required to produce Stored Books and Records in
response to a valid order or request of a Governmental Authority (a "
_Regulatory Order_ "). The Sellers shall have exclusive control over the
production of Stored Books and Records held by them pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.20_, including the level of access granted with respect thereto, in
response to any Regulatory Order. The Buyers shall notify the Sellers in
writing as promptly as practicable of any Regulatory Order relating to any
Stored Books and Records. The Sellers shall have the right to review and
approve any correspondence, filings or other communications by and between any
member of the Company Group and any Governmental Authority or other
governmental body if any Stored Books and Records are contained in any such
correspondence, filing or other communication (each, a " _Regulatory
Communication_ ") and the members of the Company Group shall incorporate the
modifications provided by the Sellers therein. The Sellers may object to a
Regulatory Communication only if, in the good faith opinion of the Sellers,
such Regulatory Communication (or the actions contemplated thereby) could
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any Applicable Law to which
the Sellers, their Affiliates or the members of the Company Group are
subject, _provided_ , _however_ , that if in the opinion of counsel of the
members of the Company Group, such Regulatory Communication (or the actions
contemplated thereby) would not be responsive or the Sellers
withholding consent thereto would result in any member of the Company Group
incurring any liability or being in breach of any Applicable Law to which the
Sellers, their Affiliates or the members of the Company Group are subject,
then the Sellers may not unreasonably withhold their consent to such
Regulatory Communication. If the Sellers do not provide any comments to such
Regulatory Communication within three (3) Business Days of receipt thereof by
the Sellers, then the Sellers shall be deemed to consent thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ to the contrary, if the
members of the Company Group determine, in their reasonable discretion, that a
Regulatory Communication requires an immediate response, then the members of
the Company Group shall (1) use reasonable best efforts to notify the Sellers
prior to making such Regulatory Communication and (2) if such prior written
notice is not practicable, make such Regulatory Communication and promptly
thereafter notify the Sellers, as well as provide the Sellers with a true and
complete copy thereof.

 



48 (iii) The members of the Company Group shall promptly reimburse the Sellers
for any reasonable expenses (including reasonable internal and external
attorneys fees) incurred by the Sellers or their Affiliates in connection
with the response to any Regulatory Order for interviews with the Sellers or
their Affiliates directors, officers, employees or other personnel. For the
avoidance of doubt, the members of the Company Group shall have no obligation
to pay or reimburse the Sellers for any costs or expenses in relation to
storage of the Stored Books and Records.

Section 5.21 _Updates to Section_ __ _ 3.21_. At or any time prior to the
Closing by written notice to the Buyers, the Company and/or the Sellers shall
be entitled to make such updates to _Section_ __ _ 3.21_ of the Company Group
Disclosure Schedule with respect to the disclosure required pursuant 
_Section_ __ _ 3.21_ of this Agreement as the Company or the Sellers, as
applicable, reasonably believe are necessary or appropriate to reflect any
changes since the date of this Agreement through the date of the most
recently available Track Records and Track Record Composites. For the
avoidance of doubt, "most recently available" shall refer to Track Records and
Track Record Composites as of the most recent month-end prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that if the Closing occurs prior to the tenth Business Day after
the most recent month-end, Track Record and Track Record Composites as of the
last day of the month prior to the most recently completed month shall be the
"most recently available".

ARTICLE VIII

_TAX MATTERS_

Section 8.1 _Allocation of Consideration_. The Closing Payment Amount, plus
any other amounts treated as amount realized under U.S. federal income Tax
law (including, to the extent so treated, assumed liabilities), shall be
allocated in accordance with the following procedures (the " _Allocation
Statement_ "). The Allocation Statement will be made in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
any analogous provision of foreign, state or local Applicable Law. The Company
Group, the Sellers and the Buyers agree to file all Tax Returns and make all
other necessary filings consistent with the Allocation Statement, unless
required otherwise by Applicable Law. No later than 45 days after the Closing
Date, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers for the
Sellers review and approval, a draft of the Allocation Statement (the "
_Draft Allocation Statement_ "). Within 60 days following the Sellers receipt
of the Draft Allocation Statement, the Sellers shall provide 

 



52  comments on the Draft Allocation Statement and the Buyers and Sellers agree
to discuss such comments in good faith. If, within 60 days after the delivery
of the Draft Allocation Statement, the Buyers and the Sellers have not agreed
on any disputed aspects of the Draft Allocation Statement, any disputed
aspects of the Draft Allocation Statement shall be submitted in writing to the
Firm which shall resolve such disputes as promptly as possible. The Company
Group, the Sellers and the Buyers shall cooperate with each other to enable a
Firm (which shall be appointed in the manner provided for in _Section_ __ _
1.7_, applied _mutatis mutandis_ ) to resolve any such dispute, and the
costs, expenses and fees of such Firm shall be borne equally by the Sellers,
on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand. Following the resolution
of any such dispute, the Draft Allocation Statement as modified shall become
the Allocation Statement. The Allocation Statement shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect any other payment treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price hereunder. Neither the Buyers nor the Sellers, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall take any Tax position on any Tax Return, audit
or otherwise that is inconsistent with the allocation set forth on the
Allocation Statement, unless required otherwise by Applicable Law.

 

Section 8.2 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing Date, Sellers, on
the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to): (a) reasonably assist the other parties in
preparing and filing any Tax Return with respect to the Company Group that
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance
with this Agreement; (b) reasonably cooperate fully in preparing for any
audit of, or dispute with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Return of the
Company Group relating to taxable periods for which the other parties may have
liability under this Agreement; (c) make available to the other and to any
Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and
documents relating to Taxes of the Company Group; (d) provide timely notice to
the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment of
the Company Group for taxable periods for which the other parties may have
liability; and (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such Tax audit or assessment.

Section 8.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, gross receipts, transfer, value
added, intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges
(together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, fees, additions to tax
or additional amounts with respect thereto) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
equally by the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other. The
party required by Applicable Law to file any Tax Return and other
documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes shall (i) prepare and duly and
timely file such Tax Return and other documentation, (ii) provide the other
party with a true copy of each such Tax Return and other documentation as
filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof, and (iii) permit the other
party to review and comment on such Tax Return and other documentation prior
to filing; _provided_ that, if required by Applicable Law, the other party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation. The Company Group, the Sellers and the
Buyers shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate the Transfer Taxes to the
extent such efforts do not impose any cost or other adverse effect on such
party or any of its Affiliates.

 



53 Section 8.4 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Sellers will be responsible for and will cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns for members of the Company Group and will cause to be prepared and/or
filed all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns that include any such
member for all taxable periods beginning on or before the Closing Date, in
each case if the matters reflected on such Tax Returns could affect any
Tax liability of the Sellers, their direct or indirect owners, or their
Affiliates for any period. All Tax Returns that are to be prepared and/or
filed by Sellers pursuant to this paragraph shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices and shall be submitted to the Buyers not later
than 30 days prior to the due date (as extended, if applicable) for filing of
such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days following the Closing
Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date). If the Buyers,
within 15 days after delivery of any such Tax Return, notify Sellers that they
object to any item in such Tax Return, the parties shall attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute and, if they are unable to do so, any disputed item
shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline
for filing such Tax Return) by a nationally recognized Independent Accounting
Firm chosen by both the Buyers and Sellers. Upon resolution of all
disputed items, the relevant Tax Return shall be filed on that basis by the
Buyers or the Sellers, as applicable. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Buyers on the one hand
and Sellers on the other. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
8.4(a) shall require Sellers to deliver to Buyers, or permit Buyers to review
or approve, any income or franchise Tax Returns of Sellers (or their direct or
indirect owners) on which the operations of a Company Group member that is a
disregarded entity for such Tax purposes is included.

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Buyers shall not (and
shall not cause or permit any member of the Company Group to) amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant any extension of the statute of limitations with
respect to assessment in connection with) any previously filed Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company Group with respect to any period
beginning on or before the Closing Date if the matters reflected on such Tax
Returns could affect any Tax liability of the Sellers, their direct or
indirect owners, or their Affiliates for any period.

(c) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and by the relevant
Organizational Documents of the applicable Fund, the Buyers shall cause the
income, gain, loss, and deduction of each Fund that is treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal (or corresponding state or local) Tax purposes
and in which any member of the Company Group owns an interest to be
apportioned between the Sellers and the Buyers in accordance with the "interim
closing of the books" method under Section 706 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder (and corresponding provisions of state or local law).

Section 8.5 _Tax Contests_. Sellers shall have the sole right to represent
the interests of the members of the Company Group in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax for any taxable period
beginning on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of their
choice at Sellers expense, if the results of such audit or proceeding could
affect any Tax liability of the Sellers, their direct or indirect owners, or
their Affiliates for any period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Buyers
shall be entitled to participate at their own expense with respect to such
audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be
entitled to settle administratively any claim regarding Taxes with respect to
any Tax Return of any member of the Company Group that adversely would affect
the liability for Taxes of the Buyers or the Company Group for any period
ending after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the
Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed.

 



54 Section 8.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving any member of the Company Group
(excluding any commercial agreement the primary purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes, such as a credit, employment, or sale agreement that has
customary Tax gross-up or indemnity provisions), written or oral, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no member of
the Company Group shall be bound thereby or have any liability or
obligation thereunder.

Section 8.7 _Tax Periods_. The parties shall, to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law, reasonably cooperate to elect with the relevant Taxing
Authority for all Tax purposes to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
the taxable period of each member of the Company Group. Even where not so
permitted, to the extent relevant to determining the accuracy of
any representations made with respect to Taxes under _Section 3.15(e)_ , and
without imposing any separate basis of indemnification for any party, it is
agreed that any Tax period of any member of the Company Group that includes
the Closing shall be deemed to end immediately prior to the Closing .

Section 9.1 _Survival_. Except (a) for the Sellers Fundamental Representations
and the Buyers Fundamental Representations, which shall survive the Closing
until the date that is 20 years following the Closing Date, (b) for those
representations and warranties a breach of which constitutes a Specified
Indemnifiable Claim, which shall survive the Closing for a period of 12
months from the Closing Date, and (c) in the case of knowing and intentional
fraud, none of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and each such representation and warranty shall
terminate at and as of the Closing. None of the covenants and agreements of
the parties which by their terms are required to be performed at or prior to
the Closing shall survive the Closing and each such covenant and agreement
shall terminate at and as of the Closing. Covenants and agreements which by
their terms are required to be performed after the Closing shall survive the
Closing only until the expiration of the term of the undertaking set forth in
such covenants and agreements.

 

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. After the Closing and subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ , the Sellers and the Employer
Entity (as to the Employer Entity only with respect to _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)_), jointly and severally (the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ "), shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyers and their respective
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Company Group),
and their respective officers, directors, managers and employees (collectively
the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against (i) with respect to
clauses (a), (b), (d) and (e) below, any Losses arising out of or resulting
from, directly or indirectly (whether directly or through a Third Party Claim)
and (ii) with respect to clause (c) below, any Specified Losses arising from:

(a) any Specified Indemnifiable Claim which is made within 12 months of the
Closing Date;

 



55 (b) the Seller Retained Liabilities if a claim is made with respect thereto
within 20 years following the Closing Date;

(c) the Specified Matter;

 

(d) the breach of a Sellers Fundamental Representation; and

 

(e) the breach of or failure to perform any of the covenants or agreements in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that by their terms are required to
be performed after the Closing by the Sellers or their Affiliates.

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by the Buyers_. After the Closing and subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article IX_ , the Buyers, jointly and
severally (the " _Buyer Indemnifying Parties_ ", together with the Seller
Indemnifying Parties, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ " and each, an "
_Indemnifying Party_ " ), shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, managers and employees (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ", together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ " and each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " ) from and against any Losses
arising out of or resulting from, directly or indirectly (whether directly or
through a Third Party Claim):

(a) the breach of a Buyers Fundamental Representation; and

 

(b) the breach of or failure to perform any of the covenants or agreements in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that by their terms are required to
be performed after the Closing by the Buyers or their Affiliates.

Section 9.4 _Limitations of Liability_.

 

(a) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any claims for Losses pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_:

(i) unless such claim or series of related claims for which a Buyer
Indemnified Party otherwise would be entitled to indemnification exceeds
$125,000 (the " _Minimum Claim Amount_ ");

 

(ii) unless the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties otherwise would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ (including any claim or series of
related claims for which a Buyer Indemnified Party otherwise would be entitled
to indemnification but for the fact that the Losses relating to such claim(s)
are less than the Minimum Claim Amount) exceeds $6,000,000 (the " _Deductible
Amount_ "), and in such case indemnification would only be applicable to those
Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; and

(iii) for any amounts in excess of the Seller Portion of $45,000,000.

 



56 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ shall not apply to
Losses arising out of a matter set forth in clause (3) in the definition of
Designated Matter;

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ and _Section_
__ _ 9.2(d)_ shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price;

 

(iii) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Buyer Indemnifying
Parties under  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ shall in no event exceed the Purchase
Price;

(iv) except as expressly provided in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_, in no event
shall the Seller Indemnifying Parties be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any matter set forth in the Company Group Disclosure
Schedule;

 

(v) nothing in this Agreement shall limit any recovery in the case of knowing
and intentional fraud; and

 

(vi) any obligation of the Seller Indemnifying Parties for indemnification
under _Sections 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(c)_ (after giving effect to the limitations
set forth herein, including (for the avoidance of doubt, other than in the
case of indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_) those set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_) shall only be for the Seller Portion of the
applicable Losses (with the remaining portion of any indemnification in
respect of such Losses to be borne by the participants in the Buyer Payment
Plan through reduction of the aggregate amount of any remaining payments
under the Buyer Payment Plan (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
aggregate amount of remaining payments under the Buyer Payment Plan is
insufficient to cover such reduction, then the shortfall shall be borne by the
Buyers and the Sellers shall not have any further or additional obligation in
respect of such shortfall), and in no event shall any such participant, any of
the Buyers and their Affiliates or any other Person have any recourse, any
rights of contribution or any other rights against any Seller Indemnifying
Party in respect of the portion of any such indemnification amount so borne by
such participants). For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of Losses for any
claims for indemnification that may be made against the Seller Indemnifying
Parties and the participants in the Buyer Payment Plan shall be aggregated for
purposes of calculating the Minimum Claim Amount and the Deductible Amount.

 

Section 9.5 _Calculation of Indemnification Payments_.

 

(a) The amount of Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by an
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from a third party (including any
insurer) whether by way of payment, credit, off-set, counterclaim,
indemnification, contribution or otherwise and (ii) the amount of any Tax
benefit actually received by an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates with
respect to any Applicable Taxable Year in connection with the accrual,
incurrence or payment of any such Losses (including any reduction in Taxes
actually payable or any increase in Tax refunds due). Each party agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to make any claims for insurance and/or
indemnification, or contribution available from any third party(ies) with
respect to any Losses for which it elects to seek

 



57  indemnification hereunder and to diligently pursue such claims in good
faith. If any such insurance proceeds and/or other amounts are received by an
Indemnified Party after the Indemnifying Party pays any amount pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount such Indemnifying Party would not have had to
pay pursuant to this _Article IX_, had such insurance proceeds and/or other
amounts been received by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates prior to
such payment by the Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_.

 

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate its
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder. In the event that an Indemnified Party fails to use reasonable best
efforts to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall
have no liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have
been avoided had such Indemnified Party made such efforts. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Indemnified Parties shall implement such reasonable actions
as the Indemnifying Parties shall request for the purposes of mitigating the
possible Losses arising from any fact or circumstance giving rise to the
indemnifiable Loss.

 

Section 9.6 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_  shall be treated
by all parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income
and other applicable tax purposes.

 

Section 9.7 _Third Party Claims_. In the event that an Indemnified Party
desires to make a claim against an Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_
in connection with any action, claim, Proceeding or demand at any time
instituted against or made upon an Indemnified Party by any third party for
which such Indemnified Party may seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in any event
within 10 Business Days of receiving written notice of such Third Party Claim,
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim and of
such Indemnified Partys claim of indemnification with respect thereto;
_provided_ that failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
such Indemnifying Party from liability except to the extent such Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced thereby. An Indemnifying Party shall have 10 Business
Days after receipt of such notice to notify the applicable Indemnified Party
if such Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at its own
expense to conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim through counsel of its own choosing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i)
the Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel at its own expense and (ii) no compromise or settlement
of such claims may be effected by an Indemnifying Party without the
Indemnified Partys consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of laws or any violation of the rights of any Person, and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by such
Indemnifying Party (to the extent provided for herein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall an Indemnifying Party be entitled to assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnified Party shall have
given such Indemnifying Party written notice that it has determined, based
upon the advice of its counsel, that a bona fide conflict of interest makes
separate representation by the Indemnified Partys own counsel advisable or
(ii) such Third Party

 



58  Claim relates to or arises in connection with any material criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation against an
Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within 30 Business Days after receipt from such Indemnified Partys
notice of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim at the expense of
such Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party
may not settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
An Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party from
time to time for any and all reasonable documented expenses reasonably paid
for or incurred by such Indemnified Party and for which such Indemnifying
Party is obligated pursuant to this _Article IX_ (which obligation shall, for
the avoidance of doubt, in the case of reimbursement by the Seller
Indemnifying Parties, only be for the Seller Portion of any such expenses),
upon submission by the Indemnified Party of a statement reflecting the basis
upon which such amounts are sought and the computation of such amounts.

Section 9.8 _Procedure for Indemnification  Direct Claims_. In the event of
any claims for indemnification under this _Article IX_ other than Third Party
Claims, including any claim against any party to this Agreement (a " _Direct
Claim_ "), an Indemnified Party shall provide a written notification to the
Indemnifying Party describing with reasonable specificity, to the extent
known, the basis for such claim and the nature of the breach and a description
of the Losses incurred and the amount of such Losses (if known). If within 30
Business Days an Indemnifying Party has not contested such claim in writing,
such Indemnifying Party will pay the full amount thereof within 10 Business
Days after the expiration of such period. During such 30 Business Day period,
such Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable
access to its books and records during normal business hours for the purpose
of allowing the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to verify any
such claim for Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnified Party
shall not be required to provide such access or disclose any information where
such access or disclosure would result in a waiver of attorney-
client privilege or a violation of Applicable Law.

Section 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.7_
of this Agreement or in _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ of the Company Group Disclosure
Schedule or in the case of knowing and intentional fraud, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or the post-Closing adjustment
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 1.9_, or _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.18_.
Subject to the foregoing the Indemnified Parties hereby waive, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law all other
claims and remedies relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby they may have against an Indemnifying Party
whether arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or otherwise. Subject to the
foregoing, all rights, claims and causes of action that may be based upon, in
respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in
any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of) the parties. No
Person who is not a party including any current, former or future
representative or Affiliate of any party, or any current, former or future
representative or 

 



59  Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "),
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach and to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, each party hereby waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations
against any such Nonparty Affiliates. The Parties agree that the Nonparty
Affiliates shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.

Section 9.10 _Certain Matters_. Section 9.10 of the Company Group Disclosure
Schedule is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any
conflict between Section 9.10 of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule and
this Article IX, Section 9.10 of the Company Group Disclosure Schedule shall
govern.

Section 10.1 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended, altered
or otherwise modified, and no provision hereof may be waived, except by
written instrument executed by the Company, the General Partner, the Sellers
and the Buyers. No waiver shall constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other inaccuracy, breach or failure to
strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement. No failure on the part
of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of

exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

Section 10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Annexes,
Schedules, Company Group Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Agreements, the
Confidentiality Agreement and any other schedules, certificates, lists and

of the parties hereto, except as expressly provided herein, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, discussions, negotiations and
communications, written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. None of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates
shall be deemed or required to assume any express or implied obligations with
respect to non-competition or non-solicitation of clients or customers in the

of doubt, clients or customers of the Company Group).

 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that none of the parties nor any of
their respective Affiliates, representatives or agents is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied,
other than those set forth in _Articles II_ , _III_ and _IV_ (as applicable),
and no party is relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral
or written, express or implied, made by any other party or such other partys
Affiliates, representatives or agents (including with respect to (i) any
projections, estimates or budgets for

information relating to the Company Group or its businesses made available to
the Buyers or their counsel, accountants or advisors in the Sellers data
room or otherwise or (iii) the information contained in any management

hereby), except for the express representations and warranties set forth in
such Articles. EACH OF THE SELLERS AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY OR
SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY GROUP. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the Buyers acknowledges and agrees that (i) it is

merits and risks of an investment in the Company Group and (v) it believes
that the investment in the Company Group is suitable and appropriate for the

Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_, _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, _Article IX_ and this  _Article
X_ , no provision of this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon any entity or Person other than the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Agreement or any part hereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by
any of the parties without the prior written consent of the Buyers, in the
case of any assignment by any Seller, the Company or the General Partner, or
of the Sellers, in the case of any assignment by the Buyers; _provided_ that,
so long as any such assignment would not (x) reasonably be expected to have
the effect of delaying in any material respect or preventing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and/or (y) result in the imposition
of any additional costs (other than de minimis costs) on any Buyer (in the
case of an assignment by any Seller) or on any Seller, the Company or the
General Partner (in the case of an assignment by any Buyer) , (a) a Seller
may assign, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, pursuant to
a written instrument in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyers, this
Agreement or any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or
more controlled Affiliates of a Seller, _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that, in addition to the Sellers, any such assignee(s) shall be deemed to make
the representations of such Seller contained in _Article II_ of
this Agreement for all purposes hereof, and (b) Parent Buyer may assign, by
operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, pursuant to a written
instrument in a form reasonably acceptable to the Sellers, this Agreement or
any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more controlled
Affiliates of Parent Buyer, including the assignment of its rights to purchase
the Company Interests to one controlled Affiliate and its rights to purchase
the GP Interests to another controlled Affiliate, _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that, in addition to the Parent Buyer, any such assignee(s) shall
be deemed to make the representations of the Parent Buyer contained in
_Article IV_ of this Agreement for all purposes hereof. Any assignment
permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall not relieve the
assignor from any obligation under this Agreement.

 



63 Section 10.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree
that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including
monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (y) nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_ shall require any party to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ before exercising any
termination right under _Article VII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination) nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_ or anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, it being
understood that all of the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise

(a) Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP (" _Skadden_ ") has been engaged
by Fortress Parent to represent and render legal advice to the Sellers in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Buyers (on
its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) and the Company (on its behalf and
on behalf of the other members of the Company Group) hereby (i) acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
any Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group), on the
one hand, and a Seller and/or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
Skadden may represent such Seller and/or any of its Affiliates in such dispute
even though the interests of such Seller and/or its Affiliates may be directly
adverse to the interests of such Buyer and/or its Affiliates (including the
Company Group) and even though Skadden may have represented such Buyer and/or
any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group) in matters substantially
related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for such Buyer
and/or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group) and (ii)
irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any conflict in connection
therewith.

 

(b) Each Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) and the Company
(on its behalf and on behalf of the other members of the Company Group)
acknowledges and agrees that as to all communications between Skadden and/or
any other legal counsel (including in-house counsel) to a Seller and/or any of
its Affiliates (including the Company Group) (collectively, " _Counsel_ "),
on the one hand, and such Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company Group) (including any such communications conducted through any of the
respective directors, officers, managers, employees, agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing), on the other hand, that relate in
any way to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (" _Attorney-Client Communications_ "), the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belong
exclusively to such Seller and shall not pass to the Buyers or any member of
the Company Group, and the attorney-client privilege (or any waiver thereof)
with respect to Attorney-Client Communications shall be exclusively controlled
by the Sellers (and not the Buyers or any member of the Company Group). In

 



65  furtherance of the foregoing, each Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) agrees that, from and after the Closing, (i) none of Buyers or any
of their Affiliates (including the Company Group) shall claim or purport to
waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to any Attorney-Client
Communications (including in any dispute between a Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Group), on the one hand, and a Seller
and/or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, including any such dispute
relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby) and (ii) each Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after Closing, the Company Group) shall maintain the
confidentiality of all Attorney-Client Communications (and, in the event that
any disclosure thereof shall be required or requested by any Person in any
Proceeding to which such Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after
Closing, the Company Group) is a party or otherwise, such Buyer shall promptly
notify the Sellers of such requirement or request and afford the Sellers the
reasonable opportunity to assert the attorney-client privilege and/or seek a
protective order with respect to the Attorney-Client Communications to prevent
such disclosure, and such Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with the Sellers in connection therewith).

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to the Closing, each Seller shall have the right to cause to be removed
from the possession of the Company Group and transferred to such Seller any
documents and other written communications (including e-mail and other
information in electronic or digital form) containing (i) Attorney-Client
Communications or (ii) other attorney-client privileged information where the
attorney-client privilege belongs jointly to any of a Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company Group), on the one hand, and any member of
the Company Group, on the other hand (collectively, " _Privileged Documents_
"). From and after the Closing, each of the Buyers and the Company shall,
promptly upon becoming aware of any member of the Company Group remaining in
possession of any Privileged Documents, notify the Sellers thereof and cause
such Privileged Documents to be removed from the possession of the Company
Group and transferred to the Sellers (and neither the Buyers nor any of
their Affiliates (including the Company Group) may make or retain copies of
any such Privileged Documents). The Buyers (on their behalf and on behalf of
their Affiliates) acknowledge and agree that any failure on the part of the
Sellers to cause any Privileged Documents to be removed from the possession
of the Company Group and transferred to the Sellers prior to the Closing shall
not constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of attorney-client
privilege.
