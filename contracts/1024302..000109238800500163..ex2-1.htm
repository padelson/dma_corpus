(&#147;<u>Parent Common Stock</u>&#148;), at the rate determined in this Agreement. The Company&#146;s authorized Common Stock is sometimes referred to as &#147;<u>Company Common</u>,&#148; and the Company&#146;s authorized Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock are sometimes referred to collectively as &#147;<u>Company Preferred</u>.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable by Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent, the release of which amount shall be contingent
upon certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article&nbsp;VII.</font></p>
<p><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;each of the stockholders of the

discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys&#146; fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or
that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer&#146;s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties

the expense of Parent unless Parent or its affiliates shall reasonably determine that there is a material conflict of interest between or among Parent or its affiliates and the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders with respect to such Third
Party Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders out of the Escrow Fund. Parent or its affiliates will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any
 settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholder Agent. Parent will cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and will provide reasonable access to documents, assets, properties, books and

defense, and Parent shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of Securityholder Agent. In the event that the Securityholder Agent is not entitled to
assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.3(i)(ii)&nbsp;above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with r

the written consent of the Securityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be determinative of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund. In each
case, Parent or its affiliates shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders will cooperate with Parent or its affiliates in the defense of that claim and will provide
reasonable access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by Parent and material to the claim and to make available all individuals reasonably requested by Parent for investigation, depositions, and trial. </font></p>

disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties to this Agreement or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case
the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties to this Agreement or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order,
judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.</font></p>

Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made
or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow
Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent&#146;s duties under this
Agreement and

Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents
and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent&#146;s discretion, the Escrow Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among
themselves. The Escrow
Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and
which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.</font></p>

on a successor escrow agent within thirty&nbsp;(30) days after receiving such notice. If Parent and the Securityholder Agent fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow
agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be ve

<p><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Fees</u>. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties under this Agreement shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that
the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the
Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to
this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys&#146; fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. Parent

Party. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment by Parent in Shares.</font></p>
<p><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that any payment required to be made by Parent to compensate any Company Stockholder for any Loss incurred by such Company Stockholder as a result of the breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b) shall be made in shares of Parent Common Stock. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid shall be

Stockholders must be made on or before the Expiration Date and may only be made pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article&nbsp;VII. Except for intentional fraud and willful misconduct, the maximum liability of each Company Stockholder for any Losses
incurred by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)&nbsp;the lesser of the Maximum Liability for Losses or the amount of such Losses actually incurre

solely against the Escrow Fund established under Article&nbsp;VII.</font></p>

or condition that causes such failure to meet predictions constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (C) any, directly or indirectly, related change in the trading price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market should not, in or and of
itself, be
used to judge the materiality of any such change, event or condition.</font></p>
