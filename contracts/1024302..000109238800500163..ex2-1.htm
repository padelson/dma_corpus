AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  

 This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of September 12, 2000 by and among Inktomi Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_  "); River Kwai Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "); FastForward Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "); and with respect to Section 9.3 and certain provisions of Article VII of this Agreement, Abhay Parekh, as Securityholder Agent (as defined in Article VII of this Agreement) and U.S. Bank Trust, National Association, as Escrow Agent (as defined in Article VII of this Agreement).

 

RECITALS

  

 Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company intend to effect a merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _Delaware Law_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

 The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ " ). For accounting purposes, the parties intend that the Merger be treated as a "poolingofinterests."

 

 The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of the Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) determined to unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt and approve the principal terms of this Agreement and approve the Merger.

 

 The Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have (i) determined that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Parent and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each outstanding share of the Companys authorized Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, " _Company Capital Stock_ ") and all outstanding options or other rights to acquire or receive shares of Company Capital Stock shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Parents authorized Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), at the rate determined in this Agreement. The Companys authorized Common Stock is sometimes referred to as " _Company Common_ ," and the Companys authorized Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock are sometimes referred to collectively as " _Company Preferred_."

 

 A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable by Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent, the release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article VII.

 

 Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) each of the stockholders of the Company listed on Schedule 5.15 is entering into a Voting Agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_; and (ii) each of the affiliate stockholders of the Company listed on Schedule 5.11 is entering into an Affiliate Agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_.

 

 Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, the employees of the Company listed on Schedule 5.16 are entering into Employment Agreements substantially in the forms attached as _Exhibit C_.

 
   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

 Section 1.1 The Merger.

 

 At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

 Section 1.2 Effective Time.

 

 Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article IX, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall occur as promptly as practicable following the later to occur of (i) October 1, 2000 or (ii) five (5) business days following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI. In no event shall any party be required to effect the Closing prior to October 1, 2000. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 525 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94301, unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger or like instrument (the " _Merger Certificate_ ") with the Secretary of State  of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of Delaware of such filing is referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger.

 

 At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

 

 (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is FastForward Networks, Inc."

 

 (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

 

 Section 1.5 Directors and Officers.

 

 The director(s) of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial director(s) of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 Section 1.6 Effect on Company Capital Stock.

 

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder of any of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock:

 

 (a) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or by Parent   

or any subsidiary of Parent, shall be cancelled and extinguished, and no stock
of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 (b) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. Other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) above, Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.7(a) below), and fractional shares, if any, as provided in Section 1.6(i) below, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall be converted automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 12,000,000 by (ii) the Fully Diluted Number of Shares of Company Capital Stock (as defined below) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such quotient, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 1.8 of the certificate(s) representing such shares of Company  Capital Stock. The sum of (A) the maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in exchange for Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock, including all shares of Company Capital Stock or rights to acquire Company Capital Stock included in the calculations and, if applicable, subsequent conversion to Company Common, of the Fully Diluted Number of Shares of Company Capital Stock (which does not include the number of shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) hereof) and (B) the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) hereof and (ii) the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to 12,000,000 (the " _Aggregate Consideration_ ").

 

 For purposes of the calculations above, "Fully Diluted Number of Shares of Company Capital Stock" shall be equal to the sum of:

 

 (i) the number of shares of Company Common outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

 (ii) the number of shares of Company Common issuable upon the conversion of any shares of Company Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

 (iii) the number of shares of Company Common issuable upon the exercise, and, if applicable, subsequent conversion to Company Common, of any Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not such Company Options are then vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable);

 

 (iv) the number of shares of Company Common issuable upon the exercise, and, if applicable, subsequent conversion to Company Common, of any Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not such Company Warrants are then vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable); and

 

 (v) the number of shares of Company Common issuable upon the exercise of, and, if applicable, subsequent conversion of, any other rights to acquire any securities of the Company of any nature whatsoever to Company Common; including without limitation any rights to acquire any securities of the Company described on Schedule 2.2, including without limitation rights granted to Mark Handley and the six persons offered employment by the Company who have applied for H1-B visas, but excluding any shares of Company Common issuable upon the exercise of Additional Permitted Options (as defined in Section 4.1(j).

 

 (c) _Escrow_. 1,185,083 shares of Parent Common Stock shall be subject to the Escrow Fund established pursuant to Article VII below (with fractional shares as to any holder of Company Capital Stock to be rounded down to a whole share) (the " _Escrow Amount_ ").

 

 (d) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all purchase rights and options to purchase Company Common (each, a " _Company Option_  ") then outstanding under the Companys 1998 Stock Plan or otherwise (the " _Option Plan_ ") (whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested), or otherwise, shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with provisions described below:

 

 (i) Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective purchase rights or option agreements, governing such Company Option immediately prior   

to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any vesting or
repurchase rights relating thereto), except that (A) such Company Option shall
be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common at which such Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent (the " _Assumed Options Exercise Price_
").

 

 (ii) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each holder of an outstanding Company Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option by Parent.

 

 (e) _Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock shall be, in connection with the Merger, assumed by Parent. Such assumed warrants shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the respective warrant agreements governing such warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such warrant shall, following the Effective Time, be exercisable only for shares of Parent Common Stock, in such number and at such exercise price as is determined by applying the Exchange Ratio in accordance with the terms of the applicable warrant agreement.

 

 (f) _Conversion Schedule_. Attached as _Exhibit D_ is a schedule (the " _Preliminary Conversion Schedule_ ") showing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to each holder of Company Capital Stock and each holder of rights to acquire Company Capital Stock including the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund (defined in Section 7.3), as of the execution of this Agreement as if the Effective Time and the exchange of shares pursuant to the Merger had occurred as of the date of the execution of this Agreement. The Securityholder Agent shall prepare a final schedule as of the Effective Time (the " _Final Conversion Schedule_ "), and an officer of the Company shall execute the Final Conversion Schedule and deliver to Parent at Closing.

 

 (g) _Stock Subject to Repurchase_. All shares of Parent Common Stock which are issued in the Merger in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock which, under applicable stock purchase, stock restriction, or similar agreements with the Company, are unvested or subject to a repurchase option or other condition of forfeiture that by its terms does not terminate due to the Merger (" _Company Restricted Stock_ "), will also be unvested or subject to the same repurchase option or other condition (except that Parent will be substituted for the Company, where appropriate), as the case may be, and the certificates evidencing such shares will be marked with an appropriate legend.

 

 (h) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (i) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. 

 

 (j) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Pre-Closing Trading Price of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Pre-Closing Trading Price of Parent Common Stock_ " shall equal the average per-share closing price of Parent Common Stock in trading on the Nasdaq National Market over the ten trading days ending two trading days immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement.   

 (k) _Adjustments to Aggregate Consideration_. If, at any time or from time to time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company issues any Additional Permitted Options (as defined in Section 4.1(j)) under the Option Plan, then the Aggregate Consideration shall be increased by that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common that are issuable upon exercise of all such Additional Permitted Options multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

 Section 1.7 Appraisal Rights.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law or, if applicable, dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code (" _California Law_ ") and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights or, if applicable, dissenters rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise  any of the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under Delaware Law or, if applicable, dissenters rights with respect to such shares under California Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal or, if applicable, dissent, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6, as the case may be, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock.

 

 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal or dissenters rights with respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or California Law and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law or dissenters rights under California Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of or dissenters rights on capital stock of the Company or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

 Section 1.8 Surrender of Certificates.

 

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Wells Fargo Shareowner Services to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger.

 

 (b) _Parent to Provide Common Stock_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within three (3) days thereafter, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and the aggregate cash payment owing pursuant to Section 1.6(j) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that, on behalf of the holders of Company Capital Stock, and pursuant to Article VII, Parent shall deposit into an escrow account a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 1.6. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock  shall be in accordance with the Final Conversion Schedule and shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Section 1.6(b) by virtue of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may   

reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions to such letter and subject to the
requirements and restrictions of any other agreement between Parent and any
holder of Company Capital Stock on or before the Effective Time, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the
Escrow Fund on such holders behalf pursuant to Article VII), plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(j), to which such
holder is en titled pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VII,
Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in
Article VII) a certificate or certificates representing that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount which shall be registered in

against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

 (b) The Company Stockholders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 7.2 until such time as the total amount of all Losses that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees, has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $300,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deductible Amount_ ").

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any Company Stockholder, will be deposited with U.S. Bank Trust, National Association (or other institution acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Agent (as defined in Section 7.3(g) below)) as Escrow Agent (the " _Escro w Agent_ "), such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be governed by the terms set forth in this Section and to be maintained at Parents cost and expense.

No portion of the Escrow Amount shall be contributed in respect of any Company Options or any warrant exercisable for Company Capital Stock. Upon compliance with the terms hereof and subject to the provisions of this Article VII, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to obtain indemnity from the Escrow Fund for Losses covered by the indemnity provided for in Section 7.2.

the Securityholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the
manner provided in Section 7.3(f) hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of the
Escrow Period and as are specified in an Officers Certificate delivered to
the Escrow Agent prior to the termination of such Escrow Period, may be

pertaining to unsatisfied claims is delivered to the Escrow Agent at or prior
to the terminatio n of the Escrow Period, upon termination of the Escrow

Fund (as set forth on the Final Conversion Schedule).

 (ii) Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock split or stock dividend) (" _New Shares_ ") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent and added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof.

Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof.

 

 (iii) Each Company Stockholder shall have voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by such Company Stockholder (and on any voting securities and other equity securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

 

 (d) Claims Upon Escrow Fund. 

 

 (i) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.3(e), deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fun d in an amount equal to such Losses.

 

 (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.3(d)(i) , each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Pre-Closing Trading Price of Parent Common Stock. Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall certify the Pre-Closing Trading Price in a certificate signed by both Parent and the Securityholder Agent and shall deliver such certificate to the Escrow Agent at Closing. For purposes of determining which shares of Parent Common Stock will be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, shares will be delivered from each Company Stockholder pursuant to such Company Stockholders pro-rata interest in the Escrow Fund; provided however, that to the extent possible, with respect to each Company Stockhol der, such shares shall be vested and not subject to a right of repurchase, forfeiture, or other condition.

 

 (e) _Objections to Claims_. At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Securityholder Agent and for a period of forty-five (45) days after delivery of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.3(d) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written   

authorization from the Securityholder Agent to make such delivery. After the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make
delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 7.3(d), provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if
the Securityholder Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made
in the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to
the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Parent) prior to the expiration of such
forty-five (45) day period.

 

 (f) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

 

 (i) In case the Securityholder Agent shall so object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate, the Securityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.

 

 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Securityholder Agent may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be independent and have at least ten years relevant experience. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery whi le allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a court of competent law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.3(e), the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and sh all be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

 

 (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in San Mateo County, California and shall be conducted by, and under the rules then in effect, of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. For purposes of this Section 7.3(f), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators award Parent less than the sum of one-half (1/2) of the disputed amount plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the Company Stockholders as represented by the Securityholder Agent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration, and the expenses, including without limitation, rea sonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The Securityholder Agent shall pay such amounts contemplated under this Section 7.3(f)(iii) and Section 7.3(i)(ii) or other amounts contemplated in this Section 7.3 (including without limitation unreimbursed expenses of counsel for the Company Stockholders and Parent, arbitrator fees and administrative costs) by distributing shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund with respect to which Parent has not made a claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no shares of Parent Common Stock may be distributed from the Escrow Fund prior to the termination of the Escrow Period and such shares may be distributed only to the extent that such shares are not required to satisfy any claim for Losses.

 

 (g) Securityholder Agent of the Company Stockholders; Power of Attorney.

 

 (i) In the event that the Merger is approved, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any Company Stockholder, Abhay Parekh shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Securityholder Agent_ ") for each Company Stockholder (except such Company Stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware Law, or if applicable, dissenters rights under California Law), for   

and on behalf of the Company Stockholders, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common
Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to
such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Securityholder Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the Company
Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Parent; provided that the Securityholder Agent may not be
removed unless holders of a majorityininterest of the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the
position of Securityholder Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of
a majorityi ninterest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Securityholder Agent, and the Securityholder Agent shall not receive
compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Stockholders.

 

 (ii) The Securityholder Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. 

 

 (h) _Actions of the Securityholder Agent_. A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the Company Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them is deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such Company Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Company Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Securityholder Agent.

 

 (i) Third-Party Claims.

 

 (i) If any third party shall notify Parent or its affiliates hereto with respect to any matter (referred to as a " _Third Party Claim_ "), which may give rise to a claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, then Parent shall give notice to the Securityholder Agent within thirty (30) days of Parents becoming aware of any such Third Party Claim or of facts upon which any such Third Party Claim will be based setting forth such material information with respect to the Third Party Claim as is reasonably available to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part of Parent in notifying the Securityholder Agent shall relieve the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders from any obligation hereunder unless the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders are the reby materially prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice). The Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders shall not be liable for any attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Parent prior to Parents giving notice to the Securityholder Agent of a Third Party Claim. The notice from Parent to the Securityholder Agent shall set forth such material information with respect to the Third Party Claim as is then reasonably available to Parent. 

 

 (ii) In case any Third Party Claim is asserted against Parent or its affiliates, and Parent notifies the Securityholder Agent thereof pursuant to Section 7.3(i)(i) above, the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders will be entitled, if the Securityholder Agent so elects by written notice delivered to Parent within thirty (30) days after receiving Parents notice, to assume the defense thereof, at the expense of the Company Stockholders independent of the Escrow Fund, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent so long as: 

 

 (A) Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which may be incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim do not exceed either individually, or when aggregated with all other Third Party Claims, the total dollar value of the Escrow Fund determined in accordance with Section 7.3(d)(ii); 

 

 (B) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief; and

 

 (C) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of Parent, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of Parent; or to increase the Tax Liability of Parent or the Company. 

 

 If the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders so assume any such defense, the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively   

and diligently. The Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders shall
not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of Parent and/or
its affiliates, as applicable.

 

 (iii) In the event that the Securityholder Agent assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.3(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates may retain separate counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of Parent unless Parent or its affiliates shall reasonably determine that there is a material conflict of interest between or among Parent or its affiliates and the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders with respect to such Third Party Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders out of the Escrow Fund. Parent or its affiliates will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any  settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholder Agent. Parent will cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and will provide reasonable access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by Securityholder Agent and material to the claim and to all officers, directors, and employees reasonably requested by Securityholder Agent for investigation, depositions, and trial. 

 

 (iv) In the event that the Securityholder Agent fails or elects not to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim, which Securityholder Agent had the right to assume under Section 7.3(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense, and Parent shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of Securityholder Agent. In the event that the Securityholder Agent is not entitled to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.3(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with r espect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and Parent or its affiliates need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Securityholder Agent in connection therewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that except with the written consent of the Securityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be determinative of the validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund. In each case, Parent or its affiliates shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders will cooperate with Parent or its affiliates in the defense of that claim and will provide reasonable access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by Parent and material to the claim and to make available all individuals reasonably requested by Parent for investigation, depositions, and trial. 

 

 (j) Escrow Agents Duties.

 

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Article VII, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Securityholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.

 

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties to this Agreement or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties to this Agreement or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

 

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Agreement.

 

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   

 (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

 

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, the Escrow Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 (vii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Escrow Agent shall be the Non-Prevailing Party in connection with any claim or action initiated by a Company Stockholder or Company Stockholders, then such Company Stockholder or Company Stockholders shall be responsible for the indemnification of the Escrow Agen t to the full extent provided by this paragraph.

 

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If Parent and the Securityholder Agent fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be ve sted with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

 

 (k) _Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties under this Agreement shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. Parent promises to  pay these sums upon demand.

 

 Section 7.4 Insurance.   

 If the amount of Losses, at any time prior to or subsequent to the payment thereof by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII is reduced pursuant to any actual insurance coverage, the amount such reduction (net of (i) any out-of-pocket expenses, (ii) increases in premiums or (iii) any deductible incurred in obtaining such reduction) shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. 

 

 Section 7.5 Payment by Parent in Shares.

 

 The parties agree that any payment required to be made by Parent to compensate any Company Stockholder for any Loss incurred by such Company Stockholder as a result of the breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b) shall be made in shares of Parent Common Stock. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Loss by the Pre-Closing Trading Price of Parent Common Stock (taking into account any stock-split, reverse stock-split, or other similar event between the Closing Date and the date of payment), rounded down to the nearest whole number.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "person" means any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity.

 

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company; provided, however, that a Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include: (i) any occurrence or condition affecting the industry generally in which the Company operates or (ii)  any change in economic or regulatory conditions. For purposes hereof, any Material Adverse Effect on the business of the Company which is cured by the Company shall not be a Material Adverse Effect.   

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that a Parent Material Adverse Effect shall not include: (i) in and of itself, a failure by Parent to meet the revenue or earnings predictions of equity analysts as reflected in the First Call consensus estimate, or any other revenue or earnings estimate, or any other revenue or earnings predictions or expectations, for any period ending (or for which earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (ii) any occurrence or condition affecting the industry generally in which Parent operates, (iii) any change in economic or regulatory conditions, or (iv) in and of itself, any change in the trading price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market. For purposes hereof, any Material Adverse Effect on the business of Parent which is cured by Parent shall not be a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to clause (i) of this paragraph (e), the term "in and of itself" means that the parties acknowledge that (A) the failure to meet the revenues or earnings predictions of equity analysts may, in certain circumstances, have been caused by changes to, or events or conditions affecting, the business of Parent and its subsidiaries that would constitute a "Parent Material Adverse Effect," but not necessarily so, (B) the exception set forth in clause (i) is not intended to prohibit the Company from claiming that any such change, event or condition that causes such failure to meet predictions constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (C) any, directly or indirectly, related change in the trading price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market should not, in or and of itself, be used to judge the materiality of any such change, event or condition.

 

 Section 10.4 Counterparts.

 

 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 Section 10.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment.

 

 Other than the Nondisclosure Agreement, this Agreement, the schedules and exhibits to this Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties to this Agreement referenced in this Agreement: (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements herein, and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; (b) except as otherwise set forth herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder; and (c) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise specifically provided, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their respective rights and delegate their respective obligations under this Agreement to their respective affiliates.

 

 Section 10.6 Severability.

 

 In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties to this Agreement. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

 Section 10.7 Other Remedies.

 

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies in this Agreement expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

 Section 10.8 Governing Law.

 

 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.   

 Section 10.9 Rules of Construction.

 

 The parties to this Agreement agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

 Section 10.10 Specific Performance.

 

 The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
