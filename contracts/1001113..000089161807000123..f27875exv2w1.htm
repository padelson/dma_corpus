ARTICLE 2 
 The Offer 

   

 Section 2.01 _. The Offer._ (a) _Provided_ that nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event no later than five Business Days after the date hereof), Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents at least a majority of all Company Shares then outstanding (the "Minimum Condition") and to the other conditions set forth in  _Annex I_. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any 

   ##### 

  

    

of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer; _provided_ that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, (i) the Minimum
Condition may not be waived, (ii) no change may be made that changes the form
of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer Price
or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to
the Offer in addition to those set forth in _Annex I_ , or otherwise amends
or modifies the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
Company Shares, and (iii) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth
in this Section 2.01(a). Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the
date that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the date that the Offer is
commenced. Merger Subsidiary shall extend the Offer (1) if, at the scheduled
or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer
shall not have been satisfied or waived, from time to time, until the
earliest to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, (y)
the reasonable determination by Parent that any such condition to the Offer
is not capable of being satisfied on or prior to the End Date, _provided_ that
the inability to satisfy such condition does not result from any breach of
any provision of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and (z) the
End Date, and (2) for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to
the Offer or any period required by Applicable Law. Following expiration of
the Offer, Merger Subsidiary may, in its sole discretion, provide one or more
subsequent offering periods (each, a "Subsequent Offering Period") in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934 Act, if, as of the commencement of
each such period, there shall not have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and any prior Subsequent Offering Period that
number of Company Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section
253(a) of Delaware Law. Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements
of Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, accept
for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable, all Company Shares (A)
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer after the final
expiration of the Offer and/or (B) validly tendered in any
Subsequent Offering Period. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or
validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid net to the
holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding
Taxes. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits or incorporated by reference thereto, the Offer to Purchase and forms of letter of transmittal and 

   #####

cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in writing
all information concerning the Company that may be required by

Subsidiary for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Each of

information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to
holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC,
and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly provide the Company and its
counsel with (A) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications,

by participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

   ##### 

  

    

Section 7.03(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly furnish
Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of Company Shares and lists of securities positions of Company Shares
held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall treat the information contained in such labels, listing or files and
any additional information referred to in the preceding sentence in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Subsidiary that may be required by applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. 

  

 Section 2.03. _Directors_. (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to
this Section), and (y) the percentage that the number of Company Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including Company
Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Company Shares
outstanding, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause Parents
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including
increasing the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number
of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the
Company Board and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as
such individuals represent on the Company Board, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
until Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary acquires a majority of the outstanding
Company Shares on a fully diluted basis, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all of the members of the Company Board and such
committees and boards as of the date hereof who are not employees of the
Company shall remain members of the Company Board and such committees and
boards. 

  

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent (the "Continuing Directors") (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one Continuing Director) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement, including any decrease in or change of form of the Merger Consideration, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and any amendment or change to Section 8.03. Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by the action of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or 

   ##### 

  

    

the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one
Continuing Director). 

  

 Section 2.04 _. 90% Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Subsidiary an option (the "90% Top-Up Option"), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.04, to purchase that number of Company Shares (the "90% Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding (taking into account the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ that in no event shall the 90% Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company Shares (i) that would require the Company to obtain stockholder approval under Applicable Law, or (ii) in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect to Company Shares reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans as if such shares were outstanding). 

  

 (b) Merger Subsidiary may exercise the 90% Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any time after the consummation of the Offer and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that the Company Shares which Merger Subsidiary may acquire upon exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option will not be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.

   ##### 

  

    

been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices
of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025,
unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 3.02 _. The Merger._ (a) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger (the "Merger Certificate") with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Merger Certificate is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as is specified in the Merger Certificate. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

  

 Section 3.03. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof: 

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.03(b), 3.03(c), 3.05 or 3.06(b), each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be converted into the right to receive $52.00 in cash or any different amount as may have been paid per Company Share in the Offer, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); 

  

 (b) each Company Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) each Company Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

    ##### 

 

   

 (d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and (in addition to shares referred to in Section 3.03(c)) shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 3.04 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Company Shares (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.04(a) in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 Section 3.05 _. Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 3.03, any Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Company Shares (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

 Section 3.06 _. Company Stock Options; Restricted Share Awards; ESPP._ (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, other than pursuant to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP"), (each, a "Company Stock Option") outstanding under any stock option or equity compensation plan or agreement (the "Company Stock Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option to acquire shares of Parent Stock, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option (including vesting schedule and any acceleration of 

   ##### 

  

    

vesting, pursuant to any Company Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof
and set forth on Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), except
that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such Company
Stock Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the
numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator
of which is the average closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq over the ten
trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Parent Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y)
the Option Exchange Ratio. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time (and in no event later than 15 Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Company Stock
Option an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of such assumption
and conversion. With respect to any Company Stock Option that is an incentive
stock option (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto intend that such assumption
and conversion, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall conform to the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, (i) each Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be converted automatically into that number of restricted shares of Parent Stock ("Parent Restricted Shares") equal to the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share in respect of the aggregate number of Parent Restricted Shares into which the aggregate number of Company Restricted Shares owned by each holder thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be so converted) and each Parent Restricted Share issued pursuant to this Section 3.06(b) shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted Share (including vesting schedule and any acceleration of vesting, pursuant to any Company Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof and set forth on Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (and shall bear a legend containing the same restrictions on transferability), and (ii) each outstanding Company Restricted Share Unit shall be converted automatically into a substantially similar award for Parent Stock and shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Restricted Share (including vesting schedule and any acceleration of vesting, pursuant to any Company Employee Plan as in effect on the date hereof and set forth on Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), except that the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such assumed award shall be determined by multiplying the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Restricted 

   ##### 

  

    

Share Unit by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share). 

  

 (c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units and the issuance of Parent restricted Shares pursuant to this Section 3.06, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.06. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units and the Parent Restricted Shares promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than 15 Business Days after the Effective Time) and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for as long as such Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Parent Restricted Shares remain outstanding. 

  

 (d) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to (i) cause the exercise of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP no less than five Business Days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer; (ii) provide that no further purchase period or offering period shall commence under the Company ESPP following the date hereof; and (iii) terminate the Company ESPP immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 3.07 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any stock split (including reverse stock split), or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

 Section 3.08 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Articles 2 or 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any Tax law. If Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

 Section 3.09 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the

Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under
this Article 3. 

  

ARTICLE 4

Companys compliance with this Section 7.03, has made (and not withdrawn) a
_bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal in writing that the Company Board
reasonably believes, after considering the advice of its outside legal
counsel and of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not
materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 2, 2007 between the
Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and containing
additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this Section 7.03 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall
be promptly (in all events within 24 hours) provided for informational
purposes only to Parent), (iii) following receipt of and on account of such
Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (iv) take
any non-appealable, final action that any court of competent jurisdiction
orders the Company to take, but in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (i) through (iii), only if the Company Board determines in good faith
by a majority vote, after considering the advice of outside legal counsel to
the Company, that it is necessary or appropriate to take such action to comply
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act with regard to
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall be
deemed to excuse any failure otherwise to comply with the requirements of
this Section 7.03(b). 

  

 (c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action.

The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, as promptly as practicable, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with any non-public information concerning the

Any request for access or information pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be directed to any of the persons listed on Section 7.04 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Company Rights Agreement._ The Company Board shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section 5.26(b)) reasonably requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

Except as set forth on Section 7.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not involve the payment of any amounts in connection therewith) to take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make (or cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions (i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of any such 401(k) Plan, (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to any such 401(k) Plan for the period prior to termination, and (iii) for employer matching contributions (if any) for the period prior to termination.

 (a) there shall be instituted or pending any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of or payment for some or all of the Company Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or seeking to obtain material damages in connection therewith, (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit Parents ownership or operation (or that of its Affiliates) of all or any material portion of the business, assets or products of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any material portion of the business, assets or products of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any Company Shares or any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, including the right to vote the Company Shares or the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation acquired or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the Companys shareholders, (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Affiliates of any Company Shares, or (v) which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Offer; or 

  

 (b) there shall have been any action taken, or any Applicable Law shall have been proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Authority, other than the application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act or any Foreign Competition Law or any requirement for affirmative approval of a Governmental 

   ##### 

  

    

Authority under any Foreign Competition Law, that, in the good faith judgment
of Parent is likely, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a) above;
or 

  

 (c) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 5.05(a) and Section 5.05(c) shall not be true in all but _de minimis_ respects when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which need only to be true in but _de minimis_ respects as of such specified date), (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 2.02(a)(i), 5.02, 5.04(i) and 5.26, disregarding any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty, shall not be true in all material respects when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which need only to be true in all material respects as of such specified date), or (iii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, disregarding any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty, shall not be true in all respects when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than any such representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which need only to be true in all respects as of such specified date); _provided_ that the condition set forth in this paragraph (c)(iii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless the individual or aggregate impact of the failure to be true of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;  _provided further_ that in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect would result, any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.04(iii) and 5.04(iv) that would cause an adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause (A) of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be taken into account; or 

  

 (d) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its obligations under the Agreement and such breach or failure to perform shall not have been cured to the good faith satisfaction of Parent; or 

  

 (e) any change or development shall have occurred following the date of this Agreement that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (f) (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred and not been withdrawn, or (ii) the Company shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to enter into, a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by Section 7.03(b) of the Agreement) relating to any Acquisition Proposal and 

   ##### 

  

    

such announcement shall not have been withdrawn and such letter, memorandum of
understanding or Contract shall remain in effect; or 

  

 (g) it shall have been publicly disclosed that any Third Party shall have acquired beneficial ownership of more than 15% of any class or series of capital stock of the Company (including the Company Shares), through the acquisition of stock, the formation of a group or otherwise, or shall have been granted any option, right or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 15% of any class or series of capital stock of the Company (including the Company Shares), other than acquisitions for bona fide arbitrage purposes only; or 

  

 (h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be waived by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Subsidiary. The failure by Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 The capitalized terms that are used in this _Annex I_ shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of February 28, 2007, by and among Oracle Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Hotrod Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Subsidiary") and Hyperion Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
