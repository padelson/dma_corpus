iii    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
("AGREEMENT"), dated as of April 2, 2006, by and among Service Corporation
International, a Texas corporation ("Parent"), Coronado Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("MERGER SUB"), and Alderwoods Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY"). Certain capitalized terms have the meanings given to such terms
in Article VIII.   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "COMPANY BOARD") has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, and (iii)
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve this
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, desire to make
those representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein
in connection with this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. At
the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall
merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under
Delaware Law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.  
SECTION 1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The Closing shall take place as soon as
practicable, and in any event not later than five Business Days after
the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled
at Closing but subject to waiver or fulfillment of those conditions) or at
such other time as the parties hereto may agree (the "CLOSING DATE"). The
Closing shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51
West Fifty-Second Street, New York, New York 10019, or at such other location
as the parties hereto may agree in writing. The Merger shall become effective
at the Effective Time as set forth in the Certificate of Merger, which shall
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing
Date.   SECTION 1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.      SECTION 1.4 CONVERSION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:   (a)
Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company, which shares will automatically be
canceled and retired and will cease to exist and will not be entitled to
consideration in exchange therefor, and (ii) Company Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive $20.00 per share in cash, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 1.4(c) (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").  
(b) All shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive, with respect to each underlying share of Company Common Stock, the
Merger Consideration.   (c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the relevant Merger Consideration.   SECTION 1.5 MERGER SUB COMMON
STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent or the Company, each share of the common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.6 COMPANY DISSENTING SHARES.   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law (collectively, the "COMPANY DISSENTING SHARES")
shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law, except that
all Company Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of Delaware Law shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in   
2   Section 1.13, of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.  
SECTION 1.7 OPTIONS AND EQUITY-RELATED SECURITIES.   (a) COMPANY OPTIONS.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each
outstanding Company Option, whether or not then exercisable, to be cancelled
and surrendered by the holder of such Company Option in exchange for the
right to receive, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time but in
no event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, a lump
sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to
such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company Option,
subject to tax withholding by Parent and the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with Section 1.14.   (b) COMPANY WARRANTS. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall automatically be converted into
the right to receive, upon the payment of the exercise price prior to the
expiration date pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrant, a lump sum
cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares subject to such
Company Warrant and (ii) the Merger Consideration, subject to tax withholding
in accordance with the terms of such Company Warrant or Section 1.14;
provided, however, that a holder of a Company Warrant may elect to reduce the
amount of cash that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive upon
such exercise pursuant to this Section 1.7(b) in exchange for a corresponding
reduction in the exercise price.   (c) RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. The Board of
Directors of the Company, or the appropriate committee thereof, shall take
such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock unit representing one hypothetical share of Company Common
Stock granted under any of the Company Stock Plans (the "RESTRICTED STOCK
UNITS"), whether or not then vested, shall automatically be cancelled at the
Effective Time, and converted into the right to receive, as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time but in no event later than five
Business Days following the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment equal to
the Merger Consideration, subject to tax withholding by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 1.14. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall a holder of Restricted Stock Units be entitled to
a payment with respect to Restricted Stock Units under both this Section
1.7(c) and Section 1.4(a).   (d) DIRECTOR DEFERRED STOCK. The Board of
Directors of the Company, or the appropriate committee thereof, shall take
such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock held in the deferral accounts of non-employee directors
(the "DEFERRED STOCK") under the Company\'s Director Compensation Plan (the
"DCP")    3   shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time,
and converted into the right to receive, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time but in no event later than five Business Days following the
Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall a holder of Deferred Stock be
entitled to a payment with respect to Deferred Stock under both this Section
1.7(d) and Section 1.4(a).   (e) ACTIONS. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall deliver appropriate notices (which notices shall have been
approved by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
to each holder of Company Options, Company Warrants, Restricted Stock Units
and Deferred Stock setting forth each holder\'s rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Plans and the Company Warrants, as the case may be,
stating that such Company Options, Company Warrants, Restricted Stock Units
or Deferred Stock, as applicable, shall be treated in the manner set forth in
this Section 1.7. The Company shall cause the administrator of the Company
Stock Plans to take such actions under the Company Stock Plans as are
necessary to accomplish the provisions of this Section 1.7. In addition, the
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) the
Company Stock Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii) after
the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation will not be bound by any
options, rights, units, awards or arrangements which would entitle any
Person, other than Parent or its Subsidiaries, to beneficially own shares of
the Surviving Corporation or receive any payments (other than as set forth in
this Section 1.7) in respect of such options, rights, units, awards
or arrangements or shares.   SECTION 1.8 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. At
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended to read in its entirety in the same fashion as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, other than the exculpation and indemnification
provisions (which shall remain unchanged from those set forth in the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation as of the date hereof), and corporate
name (which shall remain Alderwoods Group, Inc.), and, as so amended, shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable law.   SECTION 1.9 BYLAWS. At the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended to read in their
entirety in the same fashion as the bylaws of Merger Sub, other than
references to the corporate name of the Company (which shall remain
Alderwoods Group, Inc.), and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable
law.   SECTION 1.10 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. At
the Effective Time, (a) the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the existing members of the Board of Directors of Merger Sub and (b) the
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the existing officers of the
Company.   SECTION 1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective officers
to take all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.    4    SECTION 1.12 EXCHANGE FUND.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause Merger Sub
to deposit, an amount of cash in an Exchange Fund with the Exchange Agent
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock that are to be converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 1.4. If, for any reason, the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.   SECTION 1.13 EXCHANGE OF SHARES.   (a) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates ("CERTIFICATES")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Common Stock whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.4 a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, and such other documents or information as may be required, the
holder of such Certificate shall receive the amount of Merger Consideration
provided in Section 1.4, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash or on any
unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of Certificates.   (b)
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, each such Certificate shall, subject to compliance with the
provisions of Section 1.13(a), be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 1.13. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of any share of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time
that has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
shall be paid to the transferee of such share only if the Certificate that
previously represented such share is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and to establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that any transfer or other Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable.   (c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 6 months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for    5   any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (d)
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, and upon compliance with
the relevant provisions of Section 1.13(a), the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the relevant
Merger Consideration such holder has a right to receive pursuant to this
Article I.   SECTION 1.14 WITHHOLDING. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and
paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options,
Company Warrants or Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE
II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   SECTION 2.1
CORPORATE ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, or other entity as listed in Section 2.1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedules, duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has the corporate power to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of any business conducted by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the character or location of any properties or
assets owned or leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, other than such corporate power or
defects in qualification or good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. True, correct and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and any other charter or organizational documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect at the date of this Agreement
have heretofore been furnished or made available to Parent. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions
of its certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or other charter or
organizational documents, each as amended.   6    SECTION 2.2

duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or securities of the Company
that have the right to vote (or that are convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above, as of the
close of business of March 31, 2006, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding and, except as permitted under Section 4.2(e), no shares of

Common Stock (not in excess of the amounts reserved therefor, as set forth
above) issued upon exercise of Company Options or Company Warrants, in
satisfaction of Restricted Stock Units, pursuant to grants of deferred shares
under the DCP or under the Plan. Section 2.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a true and correct list, as of the close of business on
March 31, 2006, of all rights of any character relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant or sell any
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or issuable for equity interests in, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the exercise price of any such
interests.   (b) Except as described in Section 2.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, and are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens). Except as described in Section 2.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible
securities or other commitments or agreements of any character relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any such
Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the Company or any such Subsidiary to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities.    7    (c) Except as described in Section 2.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns, or has any contract or other obligation to acquire, any equity

capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as described
in Section 2.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is obligated under any registration rights or similar
agreements to register any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on behalf of any Person.   (e) The list referred to in the
final sentence of Section 2.2(a) sets forth the name of each holder and the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such option or other
security or interest, the date of grant, the exercise or vesting schedule,
the exercise price per share and the term of each such option or other
security or interest. No shares of Company Common Stock are held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All shares of Company Common Stock
subject to issuance as described above shall, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as
set forth in Section 2.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any contract or other obligation to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
or any other capital stock or other securities of any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or
any other Person. Section 2.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets
forth a true, correct and complete list of all direct or indirect
Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date of this Agreement (including such
Subsidiary\'s (i) name, (ii) jurisdiction of incorporation, (iii) authorized
and outstanding shares of capital stock and (iv) record and beneficial owners
of such capital stock, except in the cases of (iii) and (iv) where such
owners are the Company or one or more indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
the Company) and specifically identifies each Subsidiary of the Company that
qualifies as a "Significant Subsidiary" of the Company, as such term is
defined in Regulation S-X (17 CFR ss.ss. 210.1-01, et seq.) promulgated by
the SEC.   SECTION 2.3 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION.   (a) The Company has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and,
subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly approved and adopted by the

after December 29, 2002, and ending on the date hereof. As of
their respective filing dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed, and if
amended or supplemented as of the date of such amendment or supplement,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (b) The audited consolidated financial statements

to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. The Company (i) has designed and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as    10   defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that the Company or such Subsidiary files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and (ii) has disclosed and reported,
based on its most recent evaluation of its internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date hereof, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit

reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has
heretofore furnished or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the Company\'s final report to the audit committee of the Company Board
for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2005, and all
subsequent regular quarterly updates, in each case in respect of the matters
described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence.   (e)
Except for matters resolved prior to the date hereof and except as described
in Section 2.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, (i) to the Knowledge
of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
the Company or of any its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or

its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its

each of its Subsidiaries do not have any material liability for Taxes for any

SECTION 2.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) Section 2.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of all "employee benefit plans," as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and all other employee benefit or executive
compensation arrangements, agreements, perquisite programs or payroll
practices, including any such arrangements or payroll practices providing
severance pay, sick leave, vacation pay, salary continuation for disability,
retirement benefits, deferred compensation, bonus pay, incentive pay, stock
options and restricted stock units (including those held by directors,
employees, and consultants), hospitalization insurance, medical insurance,
life insurance, scholarships or tuition reimbursements, and any employment,
change of control, severance, retention or consulting agreements
or arrangements that are maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
entity within the same "controlled group" as the Company or Subsidiary,
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (a "COMPANY ERISA
AFFILIATE") or to which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or Company
ERISA Affiliate is obligated to contribute thereunder    15   for
current or former directors, officers, employees or consultants of
the Company, any Subsidiary or Company ERISA Affiliate (the "COMPANY
BENEFIT PLANS").   (b) Except as described in Section 2.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the Company Benefit Plans is a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "COMPANY
MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). Except as described in Section
2.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the Company, any
Subsidiary nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.
Except as described in Section 2.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
none of the Company, any Subsidiary nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has
withdrawn in a complete or partial withdrawal from any Company Multiemployer
Plan, nor has any of them incurred any liability due to such withdrawal or
the termination or reorganization of a Company Multiemployer Plan.   (c)
None of the Company Benefit Plans is a "single employer plan," as defined in
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary maintains, or is required, either currently or
in the future, to provide, welfare benefits to employees, former employees or
retirees after their termination of employment and there does not now exist,
nor do any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that could be reasonably expected to be a liability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. "CONTROLLED GROUP
LIABILITY" means any and all liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA,
(ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the
Code and (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar provisions of foreign laws
or regulations.   (d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust
maintained pursuant thereto, has been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified, and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, nothing has occurred since the
date of such determination with respect to such Company Benefit Plan that
would cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of
any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.   (e) Except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, all contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of the
Company Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof, other than
a failure to make contributions that is not material.   (f) There has been
no material violation of ERISA or the Code with respect to the filing of
applicable reports, documents and notices regarding the Company Benefit Plans
with the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the Treasury or the
furnishing of required reports, documents or notices to the participants or
beneficiaries of the Company Benefit Plans.    16    (g) Except as would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect,
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Company Benefit Plans that are subject to ERISA, any
trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has
engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of
fiduciary responsibility that could subject the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or
to any liability under Section 502(i) or (1) of ERISA.   (h) Except as set
forth in Section 2.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or
delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to
any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of
the forgoing, except as set forth in Section 2.11(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be non-deductible for federal income tax purposes
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries due to Section 280G of the Code. No
Company Benefit Plan is, or could be as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in material violation of the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder.   (i)
True, correct and complete copies of the following documents, with respect to
each of the Company Benefit Plans, have been furnished or made available to
Parent by the Company: (i) all current Company Benefit Plans and related
trust documents, and amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500;
(iii) the current summary plan descriptions and any material
modifications thereto, if any (in each case, whether or not required to be
furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any;
(v) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the most recent
determination letter from the IRS, if any. Except as specifically provided in
the foregoing documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no
amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor
has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such
amendments or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan.   (j)
Except as described in Section 2.11(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
there are no material (individually or in the aggregate) pending actions,
claims or lawsuits that have been asserted, instituted or, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, threatened, against the Company Benefit Plans, the assets of any
of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator,
or against any fiduciary of the Company Benefit Plans with respect to the
operation of such plans (other than routine benefit claims).    17   
(k) All Company Benefit Plans have been maintained and administered, in all
material respects, in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of
applicable Laws and Regulations, including ERISA and the Code,
respectively (including rules and regulations thereunder), and all employees
required to be included as participants by the terms of such plans have been
properly included, except to the extent that any failure to so include the
employees would not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
material liability.   (l) Except as would not result in any material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all Company Benefit
Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States
(i) have been maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii)
if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.   SECTION 2.12 EMPLOYEE
MATTERS.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Laws and Regulations respecting
the employment of employees and the engagement of leased employees,

conditions of employment, wage and hour requirements (including the proper

agreement or other labor union contract. No labor organization or group of
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand
for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or threatened to be brought or filed, with the National
Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority.

with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any
Company Representative, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 4.3(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding the

unsolicited Takeover Proposal received by the Company which did not result
from a breach of Section 4.3 and which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, is or
may reasonably lead to a Superior Proposal, furnish information concerning
its business, properties or assets to any Third Party making such Takeover
Proposal, and may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with such Third Party concerning a Takeover Proposal if such Third Party has
submitted a Superior Proposal that is pending at the time the Company
determines to take such action if, and only to the extent that and so long
as, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance with
Section 4.3 (including, prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party, by providing written
notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Third Party), (B) prior
to furnishing such information to such Third Party, the Company receives from
such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms
substantially similar to and no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (C) in accordance with
the following sentences, the Company keeps Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and details of any such discussions or negotiations as
provided above. The Company will promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) notify Parent in writing, of the existence of any proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by the Company with respect to
any Takeover Proposal, and the Company\'s response thereto, and the Company
will promptly communicate to Parent the material terms and conditions of any
proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry that it may receive and the
identity of the Third Party making such    34   proposal or inquiring
or engaging in such discussions or negotiations. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and details of any such Takeover Proposal
and any amendments or revisions thereto. The Company shall promptly provide
to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that is provided to the Third Party making such Takeover Proposal
or its representatives which was not previously provided to Parent.   As
used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set
forth below:   "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means an unsolicited bona fide written
proposal by a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50%
of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding or assets that
constitute 50% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender
offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with respect to either the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial
advisors) to be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Merger and (ii) that, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking
into consideration (with respect to both subsections (i) and (ii) hereof) all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.  
"TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether in writing
or otherwise, from a Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined
under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of assets that constitute (i) 20% or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (ii) 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) any part of Rose Hills (other
than immaterial assets that are not part of, or necessary to, the core
business of Rose Hills), in any case, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   "THIRD PARTY" means any Person or
group other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary thereof.   (b) Except
as set forth in this Section 4.3(b), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (iii) withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.3, prior to the Approval Date, the Company Board may (A)
approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, or (B) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, (x) in either case, if the Company shall
have terminated this Agreement and shall have paid any applicable fee
required by Section 7.3 and (y) in either case, if at least five Business
Days shall have passed following Parent\'s receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board has received such a   
35   Superior Proposal that it intends to approve, recommend or accept,
specifying all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal and a
copy of any proposed agreements with respect thereto), and Parent does not
make an offer that the Company Board shall have concluded in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
is at least as favorable to the Company\'s stockholders as such Superior
Proposal. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the
Approval Date the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to so withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board\'s exercise of
its fiduciary duties, the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation.   SECTION 4.4 FINANCING ASSISTANCE.   (a) From the
date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall,

Financing.   (b) Without limiting the foregoing, at the request of Parent,
prior to the Effective Time, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining any consents or waivers to,
and giving notices of redemption in respect of, any of its Indebtedness,
provided that Company shall not be required to permit any of the foregoing to
become effective prior to the Effective Time. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to commence consent solicitations or issuer tender or exchange offers
with respect to their respective Indebtedness as and at the times that Parent
shall request ("CONSENT/TENDER OFFERS"), in each case with the cooperation of

by this Agreement and to participate in the preparation for such discussion,
telephone call or meeting. The Company and Parent may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.1 as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent as the case may be)
or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.1, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may
be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or as regards Parent\'s plans for conducting its business or
that of the Company after the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings
pursuant to this Section 5.1, but subject to Section 5.1(d), the parties
hereto shall: (i) provide or cause to be provided promptly to Governmental
Entities with regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
federal, state, local or foreign antitrust or competition law, regulation or
order ("ANTITRUST LAWS" and each such Governmental Entity, a "GOVERNMENTAL
ANTITRUST ENTITY") information and documents requested by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing any notification and report form and related material required under
the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws
promptly following the date of this Agreement and thereafter to respond
promptly (and within the time    38   frame specified by Parent in
accordance with Section 5.1(d)) to any request for additional information,
data or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act or the
Competition Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust
Laws; (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity; and (iii) use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections and challenges, including by contest through litigation on the
merits, negotiation or other action, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act and any Antitrust Laws.   (d) The parties shall
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of the Company,
Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit
Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' freedom of action (other than as would allow
Parent to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(i)) with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines
or assets of the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, in each
case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in any suit or
proceeding under any Antitrust Laws, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing, and in that regard Parent and, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate,
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
action (other than as would allow Parent to terminate this Agreement under
Section 7.1(i)) with respect to, or Parent or Parent\'s Subsidiaries\'
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that any
such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept
any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make
any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other
action that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, (i) could be expected to
result in divestiture of, or operational restrictions on, businesses, product
lines or assets (of the Company, Parent or Subsidiaries of either) having
aggregate revenues in the twelve months ending December 31, 2005 in excess of
$200 million (it being understood that such amount shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2005 of all
"affected facilities" described in Section 6.2(a) hereof), (ii) could be
expected to limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to own or
operate all or any portion of Rose Hills, or (iii) could be expected to
result in an Unacceptable Restriction (as defined in Section 7.1(i)) (the
circumstances described in any of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, an
"UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION"). With regard to any Governmental Antitrust Entity,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
Affiliates) shall, without Parent\'s prior written consent in Parent\'s sole
discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or
commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise discuss, take or commit to take any action that limits Parent\'s
freedom of action with respect to, or Parent\'s ability to retain any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of, the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing,    39   the Company agrees that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent will take
the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity in
connection with any Antitrust Laws, including by determining the appropriate
timing of any such meeting or communication (including (x) the timing of the
submission of any filing with, or response to any request by, a Governmental
Entity, and (y) the timing of any action taken pursuant to this Section). In
each such instance, the Company shall respond within the time frame
reasonably specified by Parent. Parent\'s obligations set forth in this
Section 5.1(d) are subject to the Company\'s timely compliance with all of
its obligations set forth in this Section 5.1.   (e) Parent and the Company
shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning
themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice, application or other document made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (f) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each
other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.   SECTION 5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Laws and Regulations relating to the sharing of
information, the Company agrees to provide Parent, and the officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, agents and
other representatives of Parent (collectively, the "PARENT REPRESENTATIVES"),
from time to time prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement, such information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses,
financial condition and operations. Except as required by law, Parent on the
one hand shall hold, and shall cause Parent\'s Affiliates and the Parent
Representatives to hold, and the Company on the other hand shall hold, and
shall cause the Company\'s Affiliates and the Company Representatives to
hold, any non-public information received from the other, directly or
indirectly, in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 5.3
STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Laws
and Regulations to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
the Company\'s capital stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement
(the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING"). The Company Stockholders\' Meeting
shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent)
as promptly as practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws and Regulations. Subject to Section
4.3(b), the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders entitled to vote    40   thereon proxies to be voted at the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting sufficient under applicable Laws and
Regulations to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company
agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first two sentences of Section
5.3(a) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal or
communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or by the withdrawal or
modification by the Company Board of the Company Board Recommendation unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VII, including
payment by the Company of the Termination Fee.   (b) Parent agrees to cause
all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement and consummation
of the Merger at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting.   SECTION 5.4 PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE. Unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement or making any other public (or non-
confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) regarding
the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such statement or
disclosure without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by law,
including applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or with the Nasdaq, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public statement or disclosure shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing
such press release or making such public statement or disclosure.   SECTION
5.5 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS AND FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each of the parties to this Agreement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to effect the transactions contemplated hereby
and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled the conditions to Closing under
this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party
hereto, at the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
as may be necessary or desirable for effecting the consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing, upon written notice from Parent, the Company shall request, and
use all reasonable efforts to obtain prior to Closing: (A) an estoppel
certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, duly and properly
executed by (1) any landlord or subtenant under a Real Property Lease, or (2)
any other party to a Material Contract; and (B) a subordination, non-
disturbance and attornment agreement ("SNDA"), in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, duly and properly executed by the holder of
any mortgage or deed of trust to which any Real Property Lease is or may
be subordinate, and by the landlord and the tenant under any such Real
Property Lease. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a schedule listing (i) all exercises, expirations and
conversions of Company Options and Company Warrants and issuances in
satisfaction of Restricted Stock Units since the date hereof and (ii) all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each remaining Company Option, or
into which each Company Warrant is convertible or which may be issued in
respect of Restricted Stock Units, the date of grant, the exercise or vesting
schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such
security.    41    SECTION 5.6 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTOR AND OFFICER
INSURANCE.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to
the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware Law, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each such individual who served at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner,
fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or investigative, based on the
fact that such individual is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby). The Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any such claim, action, suit, investigation
or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of separate counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Party or such Indemnified Party shall have legal defenses available to it
that are different from or in addition to those available to the
Surviving Corporation, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received; PROVIDED,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for the fees of more than
one counsel with respect to a particular claim, action, suit, investigation
or proceeding, for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless
a conflict of interest shall be caused thereby; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). This Section 5.6(a) shall be interpreted so as not to revive,
reinstate, expand or increase any obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or any applicable predecessor thereof) that were limited,
barred, discharged or otherwise modified by (i) the order of confirmation,
entered in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
and dated as of December 5, 2001, confirming the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization of Loewen Group International, Inc., Its Parent Corporation
and Certain of Their Debtor Subsidiaries, as modified, including Sections
III.D.10.h and III.D.10.i thereof) and (ii) and the Final Order
(the "Canadian Order"), entered in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and
dated as of December 7, 2001, in connection with the Confirmation Order and
the Reorganization Plan.   (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide, for a period of not less
than six years after the Effective Time, the Company\'s current directors and
officers (as defined to mean those persons insured under such policy) with an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; INSURANCE") that is no
less favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available    42   coverage;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO; Insurance in excess of 200% of the current
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance as set forth
in Section 5.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, but in such case shall
purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that at Parent\'s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no
greater than that set forth above, that provides coverage identical in all
material respects to the coverage described above.   (c) The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Company, which provisions
shall not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder as of the Effective Time of individuals who at the
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company, unless
such modification is required after the Effective Time by law and then only
to the minimum extent required by such law.   (d) The rights of each
Indemnified Party under this Section 5.6 shall be in addition to any rights
such individual may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
other governing documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other applicable Laws and Regulations or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.  
(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.   SECTION 5.7 ADVICE OF
CHANGES. Subject to applicable Laws and Regulations, the Company and Parent
each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications between
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
change, fact or condition, that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to
Parent\'s obligations to effect the Merger, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company of any change, fact or condition, that is
reasonably likely to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or that is
reasonably likely to result in a failure of any condition to the Company\'s
obligations to effect the Merger.   SECTION 5.8 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any
Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the parties hereto, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant all approvals and take all actions
as are necessary    43   so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute
on such transactions.   SECTION 5.9 ESPP. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee of the Company Board administering the ESPP) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that
with respect to the ESPP: (a) all executive officers, all vice presidents of
operations and the corporate controller shall not be permitted to participate
in the ESPP after the April 3, 2006 purchase date (it being understood that
each such person is a highly compensated employee under Section 414(q) of the
Code), (b) all other employees shall be permitted to participate in the ESPP
to an extent no greater than such employee\'s payroll deduction percentage in
the ESPP as of the date hereof, and (c) the ESPP shall terminate immediately
prior to the Closing Date and all cash amounts then in a participant\'s
payroll deduction account shall be promptly refunded.   SECTION 5.10
BENEFITS FOR COMPANY EMPLOYEES.   (a) BENEFITS. From and after the Effective
Time and until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its other subsidiaries to,
maintain in effect employee benefit plans and arrangements which provide
benefits which have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
the benefits provided by the Company Benefit Plans (not taking into account
the value of any benefits under any such plans which are equity-based). At
the request of Parent, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time,
terminate the Company\'s 401(k) plan effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If the Company\'s 401(k) plan is so terminated at the request
of Parent prior to the Effective Time, any employee who was a participant in
the Company\'s 401(k) plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive a lump sum distribution of his or her benefits from the
Company\'s 401(k) plan. Parent shall cause a comparable defined contribution
plan or plans sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, with equivalent
Company contributions, to accept direct rollovers (described in Section
402(c) of the Code) of distributions to which the employees are entitled
under the Company\'s 401(k) plan that are eligible for a direct rollover.  
(b) ELIGIBILITY. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which
any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries first becomes eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each such employee
and his or her eligible dependents under such Parent Benefit Plan, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods
applied immediately prior thereto under the analogous Company Benefit Plan;
(ii) provide such employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to becoming eligible to
participate in such Parent Benefit Plan under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under such Company
Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual or lifetime
maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan; and (iii)
recognize all service of such employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and predecessors (including recognition of all prior service with any entity
(including any such Subsidiary prior to its becoming a Subsidiary of the
Company) that was recognized by the    44   Company (or any such
Subsidiary) prior to the date hereof in the ordinary course of administering
its (or such Subsidiary\'s) employee benefits), for purposes of eligibility
to participate in and vesting in benefits under such Parent Benefit Plan, to
the extent that such service was recognized for such purpose under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan; provided, that such crediting of service
shall not be required if it would result in a duplication of benefits or
credited past service or to the extent that it is not similarly granted to
similarly situated employees of Parent.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall not apply with
respect to the terms and conditions of employment or compensation or employee
benefits of any employees of the Company, Parent and any of their
Subsidiaries who are represented by labor unions or similar collective
bargaining entities, which will be governed by the applicable collective
bargaining agreements.   (d) NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Section 5.10
is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

the Closing, would prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from operating
any facility (regardless of the amount of revenue thereof, an "affected
facility") that (x) is operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the date that a copy of such Contract is provided to Parent and (y) (1) is

any event, change, circumstance or  effect that would be a Company Material
Adverse Effect or that, in the  reasonable judgment of Parent, could result

Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or
prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:    46    (a)

such failures to be true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF
PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in
all material respects (or with respect to any obligation or agreement
qualified by materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect, in all respects)

Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or
before the date that is the 8 month anniversary of the execution of this
Agreement, or such later date, if any, as Parent and the Company agree upon
in writing (as such date may be extended as described below, the
"OUTSIDE DATE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c) shall not have been satisfied by
such date (and Section 7.1(c) is not applicable) but all other conditions set
forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived, or are capable of being
satisfied, by such date, then the Outside Date will automatically be extended
until the date that is the 12 month anniversary of the execution of this
Agreement, in which case the Outside Date shall be deemed to be that later
date for all purposes; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that a party that has materially
breached a representation, warranty or covenant of such party set forth in

entitled to exercise its right to terminate under this Section 7.1(b);  
(c) by Parent or the Company, if any judgment, injunction, order, decree or

Schedules or Parent Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof," and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the first paragraph of this
Agreement. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its
terms.   SECTION 9.6 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; provided, however, that Parent may designate,
by prior written notice to the Company, another Subsidiary of Parent to be a
constituent corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, whereupon all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary
(except that all representations and warranties with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed    60   representations
and warranties with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation, so long as such substitution would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect). Any purported assignment in violation
of this Agreement will be void AB INITIO. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.   SECTION 9.7 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as set forth in

Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without reference to such state\'s principles of

exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any
federal court located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection that they might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.   SECTION 9.9 RULES OF
CONSTRUCTION. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document

SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE
OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY.
IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A NON-COMPULSORY
COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE
WAIVED. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such illegal, void,
invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a legal, valid and
enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such illegal, void, invalid or
unenforceable provision.   SECTION 9.12 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its
agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions
as are necessary on its part to consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable
injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel performance of such party\'s obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder, in
addition to any other rights or remedies available hereunder or at law or in
equity.   [Signature page follows this page.]    62    IN WITNESS
