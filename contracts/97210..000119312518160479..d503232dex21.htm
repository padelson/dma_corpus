violation of the provisions of clause 6.9.4. If the Sellers Representative
gives its consent, no such violation shall be deemed to have occurred. The

Sellers Representative reasonably and in good faith believes that the
proposed modification, measure, action or omission shall impact or potentially
may impact the Groups ability to achieve the Revenues or EBIT Margin
required to achieve one or more of the Earn-Outs. The Parties agree that the
filing of patent applications and/or the implementation of engineering design

    6.9.6 | As long as Thomas Visti Jensen continues to work for any

CEO of any Group Company, such person shall cooperate with the Buyer to
procure that the Group is managed and operated in a commercially reasonable
manner and, subject to the exceptions at the end of clause 6.9.4, consistent
in all material respects with _Schedule 6.9_ , as it may be amended from time
to time in accordance with this Agreement. If during the period Thomas Visti
Jensen is CEO of the Group, in response to the Group performing during the
Phase-2 Revenue Period inconsistent with _Schedule_ __ _ 6.9_, the Buyer
takes actions consistent with _Schedule_ __ _ 6.9_, such actions shall for
the avoidance of doubt not constitute non-compliance with clause 6.9.4. 
---|--- 



   6.9.7 | If the Buyer or any Group Company carries out any actions or
omissions that constitute a non-compliance with the provisions of clause 6.9
and the action or omission has or could reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on the Groups ability to achieve the Revenues or the EBIT
Margin required to achieve one or more of the Earn-Outs, then the Sellers
Representative shall without undue delay upon actual knowledge of the action
or omission provide the Buyer with written Notice of such non-compliance. The
Buyer shall have 20 Business Days to correct or dispute such Notice of non-
compliance. If the Buyer disputes the asserted non-compliance or the Sellers
Representative does not accept the Buyers correction to the asserted non-
compliance, then the Sellers Representative and a designated Buyers
representative shall (i) discuss the dispute and, (ii) if the Buyer should
ultimately agree that there was a non-compliance with the provisions of clause
6.9, discuss for purposes of calculating the relevant Earn-Out in good faith
any adjustments to the Revenues or the EBIT Margin, as the case may be,
generated by the Group Companies as if such non-compliance had not taken
place. If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative are unable to reach
agreement about whether there was a non-compliance with the provisions of
clause 6.9 and/or the respective adjustment of the Revenues or the EBIT Margin
generated by the Group Companies due to such non-compliance, each of them may
initiate a claim under clause 16. The subject matter of such arbitration shall
be to ascertain: (i) if a non-compliance of the provisions of clause 6.9 has
occurred, and if the arbitrators determine non-compliance has occurred; (ii)
if the non-compliance has had an impact on the Groups ability to achieve one
or more of the Earn-Outs; and if the arbitrators determine such non-compliance
has had such an impact; (iii) the amount of the Earn-Outs to be
accelerated ("Accelerated Earn-Out Payments"), provided that such Accelerated
Earn-Out Payments shall in no event exceed the Earn-Out Payments Cap Amount,
as set forth below:    ![LOGO](g503232g0509033650778.jpg)

Outs, then the arbitrators shall determine the Accelerated Earn-Out Payments
as set forth below: 
---|--- 



     | a) | if the non-compliance occurred during the 2018 Revenue Earn-
Out Period, an amount of EUR 13,650,000 million under the 2018 Revenue Earn-
Out shall become immediately accelerated and payable to the Sellers and in
addition thereto if it is the arbitrators assessment that in the absence of
such non-compliance and based on the Groups accumulated Revenues performance
since 1 January 2018 it is more likely than not that the Sellers would have
achieved an Earn-Out Payment in excess of EUR 13,650,000 under the 2018
Revenue Earn-Out, the Phase-1 Revenue Earn-Out and/or the Phase-2 Revenue
Earn-Out, then such excess Earn-Out Payments as determined by the arbitrators
shall also become accelerated and payable to the Sellers, 
---|---|--- 



     | b) | if the non-compliance occurred during the Phase-1 Revenue
Earn-Out Period, but after lapse of the 2018 Revenue Period, an amount of EUR
17,600,000 million under the Phase-1 Earn-Out shall become immediately
accelerated and payable to the Sellers and in addition thereto if it is the
arbitrators assessment that in the absence of such non-compliance and based
on the Groups accumulated Revenues performance since 1 January 2018 it is
more likely than not that the Sellers would have achieved an Earn-Out Payment
in excess of EUR 17,600,000 under the Phase-1 Revenue Earn-Out and/or the
Phase-2 Revenue Earn-Out, then such excess Earn-Out Payments as determined by
the arbitrators shall also become accelerated and payable to the Sellers, 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | if the non-compliance occurred during the Phase-2 Revenue
Earn-Out Period but after lapse of the Phase-1 Revenue Period and if it is the
arbitrators assessment that in the absence of such non-compliance and based
on the Groups accumulated Revenues performance since 1 January 2018 it is
more likely than not that the Sellers would have achieved an Earn-Out Payment
under the Phase-2 Revenue Earn-Out, then all or a part of the Phase-2 Revenue
Earn-Out as determined by the arbitrators shall become accelerated
and payable to the Sellers. 
---|---|--- 



   6.9.7.2 | If the arbitrators determine that a non-compliance has had an
impact, but not a material impact, on the Groups ability to achieve one or
more of the Earn-Outs, then the arbitrators shall determine the Accelerated
Earn-Out Payments based on a reasonable estimate of the amount of the Earn-Out
the Group more likely than not would have achieved in the absence of such
non-compliance.    ![LOGO](g503232g0509033650778.jpg)

Phase-1 Revenue Earn-Out Period or the Phase-2 Revenue Period, respectively,
and notwithstanding any Accelerated Earn-Out Payments pursuant to clause
6.9.7, to the extent that the Group has achieved Revenues and the EBIT Margin
under the applicable Earn-Out, the Buyer shall make any required Earn-Out
Payment as provided in this Agreement, however, deducting any Accelerated
Earn-Out Payments already determined and paid pursuant to clause 6.9.7. Any
rights set forth in clause 6.9.7 shall be the only remedies of the Sellers in
case of any non-compliance of the Buyer with the provisions of clause 6.9,
provided however, that in addition hereto, the Buyer shall reimburse
reasonable costs to advisors of the Sellers Representative incurred
in connection with establishing grounds to document the specific non-
compliance with the provisions of this clause 6.9. If the Parties cannot agree
on the amount of such reasonable advisor costs to be reimbursed, the amount
of advisor costs of the Sellers Representative to be reimbursed by the Buyer
shall be decided by arbitration pursuant to clause 16.2. The arbitrators shall
when deciding the dispute _inter_ alia take into consideration the degree to
which the Sellers positions on the alledged non-compliance with the
provisions of this clause 6.9 were justified.

    10. | SPECIAL INDEMNIFICATIONS 
---|--- 



   10.1 | _Tax Indemnity_ 
---|--- 



   10.1.1 | Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the
Sellers undertaketo the extent not fully provided for in the Closing Purchase
Price Calculationto indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer or, at the Buyers
election, the respective Group Companies, on a EUR for EUR basis, from and
against any Tax claims, including any losses and costs (including fees of
external advisers, claims, penalties, interests etc.) incurred by any Group
Company (i) relating to any period until the Effective Date that are payable
by any Group Company after the Effective Date or (ii) that are triggered or
arise, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the
acceleration and/or expiry of the Warrants and/or the introduction by the
Company of the Employment Bonus Scheme. With respect to fiscal years and/or
accounting periods beginning before the Effective Date and ending after the
Effective Date, the portion of Taxes related to the time period until the
Effective Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would have to be
assessed by the competent Tax authority if the Effective Date was the end of
the respective business year and/or accounting period of the relevant Group
Company. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Sellers shall not be liable
in respect of any claim pursuant to this clause 10.1.1 to the extent that
Taxes arise or are increased by reason of (i) any change after the Effective
Date in the bases, methods or policies of Tax accounting of the Buyer, the
Company or any Group Company other than in the ordinary course of business as
conducted at the Effective Date, or (ii) any Tax claim occurring due to or
otherwise as a result of the joint taxation with Buyer or Buyers Affiliates
as further described in clause 9.2 which would not have occurred without such
joint taxation. To the extent that the Sellers can reasonably demonstrate
that an actual Tax relief is available to the Buyer or any Group Company in
relation to the Tax claim in question, the Buyer shall reimburse such actual
Tax relief if and when it is received by the respective Group Company. 
---|--- 



   10.1.2 | Any payment under clause 10.1.1 above shall be due and payable
by the Sellers from the Escrow Account and if such payment is made after
release of the Escrow Account only then directly from the Sellers within
15 Business Days after the Sellers Representative has been notified in
writing by the Buyer about the payment obligation and the corresponding
payment date pursuant to this Agreement and has received a copy of the
relevant Tax assessment notice or Tax return, but in no event earlier than 5
Business Days before the relevant Tax to be indemnified is due and payable to
the Tax authority. If any Tax for which indemnification is sought under clause
10.1.1 is contested, the payment of such Tax by the Sellers shall be due 5
Business Days after such Tax has been finally and bindingly determined by the
relevant Tax authority or court of proper jurisdiction, provided that the Tax
authority has suspended payment of such Tax until such Tax becomes final and
binding. If the Tax authority did not suspend payment of such Tax, the Sellers
shall make respective advance indemnification payments to the Buyer. If the
final amount to be indemnified for such Tax is lower than the
advance indemnification payment made by the Sellers, the Buyer shall
reimburse the difference to Sellers, including all interest received thereon
from the respective Tax authority, if any.    ![LOGO](g503232g0509033650778.jpg)

statutory limitation period for the Tax claim in question.

The Buyer is required to mitigate any Loss in accordance with the
general rules of Danish law. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer

all such Breaches and any liability pursuant to any indemnity under clause 10
shall be limited to a total amount equivalent to EUR 24,400,000 (the "Cap"). 
---|--- 



   12.4.3 | The limitations in clause 12.4 do not apply to any Breach of
any of the Title Warranties or Breach arising out of or as a result of fraud
or wilful misrepresentation, always provided that none of the
Sellers liability for such Breach can in any event exceed such Sellers
portion of the Purchase Price. For any Breach and the breach of any indemnity
or covenant as provided by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, the
Sellers liability shall be several (based on the Sellers ownership of the
Share on the Closing Date immediately prior to Closing) and not joint. 
---|--- 



   12.4.4 | Any payment by the Sellers as indemnification of Buyer against
any Loss will be considered a reduction of the Purchase Price. 
---|---

the extent that such claim is attributable to, or such claim otherwise having
arisen or is increased as a result of, any Law not being in force at the

---|--- 



   12.5.1 | In the event that the Buyer wishes to make a claim against the
Sellers or in the event that the Buyer acquires knowledge of a matter which
may give rise to a claim against the Sellers, the Buyer shall give Notice
(in accordance with clause 17.2) to the Sellers Representative within 30
Business Days, after the Buyer became aware of events or circumstances giving
rise to the claim. The Buyers Notice must include a reasonably detailed
description of the claim, its actual and legal basis and  to the extent
reasonably possible  a calculation of the Loss or the estimated Loss together
with reasonable supporting documentation. Failure of the Buyer to notify the
Sellers Representative within the aforementioned 30 Business Days does not
release the Sellers from its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement,
except to the extent the Buyers failure to so notify prejudices the Sellers
ability to defend against such claim (but not for any other part of the claim
for which the Sellers shall remain liable). 
---|--- 



   12.5.2 | The Sellers shall have a period of 30 Business Days from

to the limitations set forth in this clause. The Buyer shall upon the event of

Business Days after the Buyer becomes aware of the relevant fact or set of
circumstances, give notice thereof to the Sellers Representative;

their respective possession, and allow the Sellers Representative to take
copies thereof, in order to enable the Sellers Representative to examine the
basis of any potential Third Party Claim; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | subject to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
relevant Seller(s)) in writing accepting full liability for the Third Party
Claim: 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | not, and procure that no Group Company will, (i) make any
admission of liability and (ii) agree to settle or compromise any Third Party

     |  |  | upon the Sellers Representatives request, allow the
Sellers Representative the right to dispute and defend such Third Party Claim
in the name of the relevant Group Company, and to properly conduct
any litigation resulting therefrom. 
---|---|---|--- 



   12.6.2 | In case the Buyer fails to comply with the foregoing, the
Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer for the Third Party Claim shall be
reduced, if and to the extent such non-compliance has caused an increase in
the Loss in respect of the relevant matter. 
---|--- 



   12.7 | _Exclusive remedies_ 
---|--- 

After Closing, the rights described in this clause 12 (and clause 17.8) shall
be the Buyers exclusive remedy for any Breach. Except in case of a Breach of
Title Warranties, the Buyer is not entitled to terminate ( _h aeve_) the
Agreement. The Buyer is not entitled to demand a proportionate reduction of
the Purchase Price ( _forholdsm aessigt afslag_). The Buyer expressly waives
any right to claim damages from the present or former board of directors or
management of any Group Company with respect to any act or omissions of
such individuals and the Buyer shall seek its remedy against the Sellers
exclusively under the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions in this
clause 12.7 do not apply to any matters which are caused by fraud or wilful
misrepresentation.    ![LOGO](g503232g0509033650778.jpg)

---|--- 



   14.1 | _Non-compete_ 
---|--- 



   14.1.1 | For a period of 3 years following the Closing Date, each of
the Principal Sellers undertakes not to be directly or indirectly engaged in
any business which competes with the Groups business as
conducted immediately prior to the Signing Date nor shall such Persons for
the avoidance of doubt act as a consultant, owner, or partner of, any business
or organization which directly or indirectly competes with or is directly or
indirectly engaged in the same business as conducted by the Group prior to
the Signing Date. As at the Signing Date, the Principal Sellers are engaged in
and have the investment activities described in _Schedule_ _14.1.1_ , which
for the purposes of this Agreement are considered permitted activities and
investments not infringing the covenant set forth in this clause 14.1.1.

For a period of 6 months following the Closing Date each of the Principal
Sellers undertakes to refrain from enticing or persuading or attempting to

   14.3 | _Agreed penalty_ 
---|--- 

In addition to any other relief that may be available to the Buyer,
any violation of the covenants in this clause 14 shall trigger an agreed
penalty payable from the relevant Principal Seller in breach to the Buyer for
an amount of EUR 750,000 (with respect to violation of clause 14.1) and EUR
150,000 (with respect to violation of clause 14.2) for each violation,
however, subject to a 5 Business Days remedy period from written notice (if
remediable in full). If a violation persists for a period of more than 2
weeks, such continued violation shall be deemed to constitute a new and
separate violation, which shall entitle the Buyer to payment of additional
penalties for each period of 2 weeks where such violation persists. In
addition to any other relief that may be available to the Buyer. The
provisions in this clause 14 may be enforced by either the Buyer or a Group
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, only the Principal Seller in violation of
the provisions in this clause 14 shall be liable for payment of the agreed
penalty and the Buyer may not deduct its claim from the Escrow Amount, but
shall solely pursue its claim directly from the Principal Seller in violation.
Payment of penalty shall not relieve the Principal Sellers of their
obligations pursuant to this clause 14.    ![LOGO](g503232g0509033650778.jpg)
