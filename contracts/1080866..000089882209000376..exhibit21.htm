ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

 Section 1.1 _The_ _Offer_.

 

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article 8, and that no event shall have occurred and be continuing that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in Annex A, no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings time on July 28, 2009, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence, and Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange_ _Act_ ")), the Offer. In the Offer, each Share accepted by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive from Merger Sub the Offer Price. Parent

  shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment, and Merger Sub shall accept for
payment, all Shares which have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date.
Notwithstanding the above, the obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment,
and pay for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject (x) to
the condition that the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
shall be at least the minimum number of Shares required to approve this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein pursuant
to the organizational documents of the Company and the FBCA (the " _Minimum
Condition_ "), and (y) to the other conditions set forth in Annex A. The
conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A are for the sole benefit of
Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless
of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger
Sub, _provided_ that nothing therein shall relieve any party hereto from any
obligation or liability such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to
such condition or may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole
discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, subject to
the following sentence. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to increase
the amount of consideration payable in the Offer and to waive any condition of
the Offer, except the Minimum Condition; _provided_ that, Merger Sub, at its
sole option, may waive such Minimum Condition (i) if the number of Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn shall be at least equal to the difference
between (x) the minimum number of Shares required to approve this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein pursuant to the
organizational documents of the Company and the FBCA, less (y) the number of
Shares subject to Support Agreements or (ii) with the prior written consent of
the Company. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
Merger Sub shall not decrease the amount of consideration payable in the Offer
or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number
of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose additional conditions to
the Offer or reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open.
The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

 

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a combined Schedule 13E-3 and Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") and related Offer to Purchase, form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and including any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer_ _Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of all material disclosure relating to (i) the company financial advisor Allen and Company LLC (including the amount of fees and other consideration that Allen and Company LLC will receive upon consummation of or as a result of the Offer and the Merger, and the conditions therefor), (ii) the financial advisor Needham and Company (including the amount of fees and other consideration that Needham and Company shall receive in connection with the opinion referred to in Section 4.20), (iii) the opinions of each of Allen and Company LLC and Needham and Company

  referred to in Section 4.20 and (iv) the information that formed the basis for
rendering each of such opinions, subject to the approval of the form of such
disclosure by Allen and Company LLC and Needham and Company, respectively, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable and as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such document
is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel.
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any
written comments or other communications, and shall inform them of any oral
comments or other communications, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on
that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be
given).

 

 (c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open until at least midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth Business Day (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the date the Offer is commenced (the initial " _Expiration Date_ ," and any expiration time and date established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer as so extended, also an "Expiration Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall: (i) from time to time extend the Offer for one or more periods of up to 20 Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by Merger Sub in its sole discretion, if at the scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions of the Offer, including the Minimum Condition and the conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex_ _A_ , shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived to the extent permitted by this Agreement, and (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Merger Sub may, from time to time, extend the Offer for a period of no more than 20 days in the aggregate, if at the scheduled Expiration Date less than 80% of the number of Shares then outstanding less the number of shares held by persons subject to Support Agreements (the " _Support Agreement Shares_ ") have been validly tendered and not withdrawn. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Merger Sub be required to, or shall Parent be required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as hereinafter defined). In no event shall Merger Sub extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the consent of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with the obligations respecting prompt payment and announcement under the Exchange Act, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly following the acceptance of such Shares for payment pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement. This paragraph shall not be deemed to impair, limit

  or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or Merger Sub to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.

 

 Section 1.2 _Company_ _Action_.

 

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i) determined that it is fair and advisable for Parent to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, this Agreement and the Merger for purposes of the FBCA, (ii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares in the Offer and to the extent required, that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (such recommendation, the " _Recommendation_ ") and (iii) taken all other actions necessary to exempt the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested shareholder," "business combination," "affiliated transaction" or other similar statute or regulation promulgated by a Governmental Entity (" _Takeover Statute_ "). The Company consents to the inclusion of such approval and Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

 

 (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC on the date that Parent and Merger Sub file the Offer Documents pursuant to Section 1.1(b), a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing the Recommendation. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to mail such Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company concurrently with the mailing of the Offer Documents. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders and at the Acceptance Time, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including each amendment or supplement thereto) before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral

  responses thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel prior to their submission.

 

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date and shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to Section 6.2, the Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and other Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to make solicitations and recommendations to the holders of Shares for purposes of causing the Minimum Condition to be satisfied, including without limitation that upon ParentÂ’s request, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly prepare a joint presentation to RiskMetrics Group recommending this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

 

 Section 1.3 _Board_ _of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f)_.

 

 (a) Promptly upon the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub (the time of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), Parent or any of their Affiliates of Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer and from time to time thereafter, and subject to the last four sentences of this Section 1.3(a), Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number constituting at least a majority of the directors, on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and the percentage that such number of Shares so purchased plus the number of Support Agreement Shares bears to the total number of outstanding Shares (not on a fully diluted basis), and the Company shall, upon request by Merger Sub, promptly take all actions necessary, including, at the election of the Company, increasing the size of the Company Board or securing the resignation of such number of directors, to enable Merger SubÂ’s designees to be appointed to the Company Board and to cause Merger SubÂ’s designees to be so appointed (the date on which the majority of the CompanyÂ’s directors are designees of Merger Sub that have been effectively appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Board Appointment Date to be the same day as the Acceptance Time. At such times, subject to applicable Law and stock exchange listing standards, the Company will cause persons designated by Merger Sub to constitute a majority of each committee of the Company Board, other than any committee of the Company Board established to take action under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that at least three of the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof who qualify as independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations (such directors, the " _Independent_ _Incumbent_ _Directors_ ") shall remain members of the Company Board until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof). If the number of Independent Incumbent Directors is reduced

  below three prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Independent Incumbent
Directors (or if there is only one such director, that remaining director)
shall be entitled to designate a person (or persons) to fill such vacancy (or
vacancies), and each Independent Incumbent Director shall also designate a
successor to ensure that there will always be at least one Independent
Incumbent Director at all times prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ each
such person meets the independence requirements of the rules and regulations
of the SEC and NASDAQ and, once any such person fills a vacancy, such director
(or directors) shall be deemed to be an Independent Incumbent Director (or
Independent Incumbent Directors) for purposes hereof). If no Independent
Incumbent Directors remain prior to the Effective Time, a majority of the
members of the Board shall be entitled to fill such vacancies ( _provided_
each such person meets the independence requirements of the rules and
regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ and such director (or directors) shall be
deemed to be an Independent Incumbent Director (or Independent Incumbent
Directors) for purposes hereof). The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise.

 

 (b) The CompanyÂ’s obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Merger Sub will supply to the Company in writing promptly for inclusion into the Schedule 14D-9 and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and Rule.

 

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Merger SubÂ’s designees pursuant to this Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, if there shall be any Independent Incumbent Directors, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder, or any amendment of this Agreement, or other action adversely affecting the rights of shareholders of the Company (other than Parent or Merger Sub) to receive the Offer Price (except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement), will require the concurrence of a majority of such Independent Incumbent Directors.

 

 Section 1.4 _Top_ _-Up Option_.

 

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, up to such number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Merger Sub and any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 80% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding on a fully diluted basis immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option will be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub immediately after the Acceptance Time if following such Acceptance Time, Parent or Merger Sub do not own 80% of the outstanding Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation

  of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no judgment, injunction, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise, (ii) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not cause the
Company to have more Shares outstanding than are authorized by the Restated
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, and (iii) Merger Sub has accepted
for payment and paid for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal
requirements of all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the
Securities Act.

 

 (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of notice from Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of their intent to exercise of the Top-Up Option, notify Parent and Merger Sub of the number of Shares then outstanding. The closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by Parent or Merger Sub, which shall be no later than one Business Day after the exercise of the Top-Up Option, at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another time, date or place is specified by Parent or Merger Sub. Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall pay the Company an amount equal to the Offer Price multiplied by the number of Top-Up Option Shares specified by Parent (the " _Top-Up Consideration_ "), and the Company shall, at ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s request, cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Consideration may be paid by Merger Sub or Parent by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate cash purchase price for the Top-Up Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from time to time during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

 Section 3.1 _Effect_ _on Capital Stock_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub subject to Sections 3.1(d) and 3.1(e), each issued and outstanding Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 3.1(a)), (ii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in Section 3.1(e)), and (iii) any Rollover Shares, shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Offer Price. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Offer Price as provided in this Section 3.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Offer Price.

 

 (b) _Parent,_ _Merger Sub and Company-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any (other than any Rollover Shares, which shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time), or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 

 (c) _Conversion_ _of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, together with Rollover Shares, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock

  dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other
similar transaction, the Offer Price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 (e) _Dissenters Â’ __Rights_. The provisions of this Section 3.1(e) shall not apply unless the shareholders of the Company are determined to have the right to dissent from the Merger, and receive the fair value of their Shares, pursuant to Sections 607.1301 -607.1333 of the FBCA. In such event, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions of the FBCA (the " _Dissenting_ _Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ," and together with the Cancelled Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the FBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the FBCA), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the FBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Offer Price for each such Share in accordance with Section 3.1(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the FBCA and received by the Company relating to shareholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the FBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

 

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

 (a) _Paying_ _Agent_. At or immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to act as a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and the Rollover Shares) pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  (b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Offer Price pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ " or " _Certificate_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent (and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably determine prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Offer Price.

 

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Offer Price. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares may be paid to such a transferee if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

 (iii) The Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

 (c) _Closing_ _of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately

  prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the proper amount pursuant to and subject to the
requirements of this Article III.

 

 (d) _Termination_ _of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Offer Price, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 

 (e) _No_ _Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Offer Price would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Offer Price shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f) _Investment_ _of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article III, and in the event of any losses to the Exchange Fund from any investment such that the Exchange Fund is diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 3.2(b), the Company shall immediately deposit additional cash into the Exchange Fund to the extent necessary to reimburse the Exchange Fund for such investment losses. Any interest and other income, net of any losses, resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (g) _Lost_ _Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Offer Price.

 

 Section 3.3 _Effect of the Offer and the Merger on Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares_.

  
  (a) Each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (other than Company Stock Options held by persons who enter Support Agreements and separately agree to the treatment of such Company Stock Options in the Offer and the Merger, which Company Stock Options shall be treated in the manner so agreed) shall, as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and in exchange therefor be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Offer Price over (y) the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised; _provided_ , that if the exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Offer Price, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation or the Company, as applicable, shall pay the holders of such cancelled Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 3.3(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter.

 

 (b) Other than Company Restricted Shares held by persons who enter into Support Agreements and agree otherwise, immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) each award of restricted Company common stock (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") other than the Rollover Shares shall vest in full and (ii) subject to the ultimate vesting of such Company Restricted Shares, the holder thereof shall have the right to tender (or to direct the Company to tender on his or her behalf) such Company Restricted Shares then held (net of any Shares withheld to satisfy employment and income tax obligations) into the Offer. To the extent any Shares that were formerly Company Restricted Shares are not so tendered, upon the Effective Time, they shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in accordance with the procedures in Section 3.2(b).

 

 (c) The Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the person making such deduction or withholding shall make any required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 (d) The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take the actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3.

  none of the Company SEC Documents so filed or that will be filed subsequent to
the date of this Agreement contained or will contain, as the case may be, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent that the information in such Company SEC
Document has been amended or superseded by a later Company SEC Document filed
prior to the date hereof. The Company has made available to Parent correct and
complete copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one

 (c) The Company and the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act).

Since January 1, 2007, the CompanyÂ’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board (i) all Known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and

employees who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls and
the Company has provided to Parent copies of any material written materials
relating to each of the foregoing. The Company has made available to Parent

committee since January 1, 2007.

Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ articles of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in effect as of the date hereof, and shall not for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

  (b) From and after the Board Appointment Date, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any Action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Board Appointment Date in connection with such Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Board Appointment Date, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Board Appointment Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Board Appointment Date, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance otherwise required by this Section 6.7(c), it shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium, in respect of each policy year within such period. At the CompanyÂ’s option, the Company may purchase prior to the Board Appointment Date, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Board Appointment Date, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Board Appointment Date, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Articles of Incorporation, the By-laws or other similar organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the FBCA or otherwise (it being agreed that no such document may be amended after the Board Appointment Date in any manner that adversely affects the rights of any Indemnified Person). The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are

  intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties
and their heirs and legal representatives.

 

 (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers 50% or more of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall be required by this Section 6.8 to provide any other party or such partyÂ’s representatives with any information that such party reasonably believes it may not provide to any other party by reason of applicable Law which constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege; provided that the Company shall take reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose non-privileged information on a basis that does not compromise such privilege. For purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement, the execution of this Agreement by the Company shall constitute written consent by the Company to Parent, Merger, Sub and their Representatives to take all actions permitted or contemplated by this Agreement including, but not limited to, Section 8.1(c)(ii).

 

 Section 6.9 _Notification_ _of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer or Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or

  involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,

in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied. The parties agree and
acknowledge that the CompanyÂ’s compliance or failure of compliance with this
Section 6.9 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining

satisfied.

 Section 6.11 _Control_ _of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Board Appointment Date, and (ii) prior to the Board Appointment Date, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

proposal; and (G) prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party be liable for punitive damages.

 

 Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

 (a) _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that:

 

 (i) (A) a bona fide Alternative Proposal shall have been made known to the Company, the Board, or senior management of the Company, or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company or any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide intention (not subsequently withdrawn) to make an Alternative Proposal and (B) following the occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent

  pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) at a time when Parent would have been entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or by Parent
pursuant to 8.1(d)(ii) or 8.1(d)(v) and (B) the Company enters into a letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other definitive
agreement with respect to an Alternative Proposal, or consummates an
Alternative Proposal, within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is
terminated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this Section 8.3(a)(i), the
references to "20%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%"); or

 

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii); or

 

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(iv) .

 

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.3(a),
the Company shall pay to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated in
writing by Parent (" _Payee_ ") a termination fee of $30,000,000 in cash (the
" _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

 (b) _Payment_ _of Company Termination Fee_. Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.3(a) shall be made to Payee on the date an Alternative Proposal is consummated or any such letter is exercised or agreement is entered into (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment) less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(d), if any; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.3(a) shall be made to Payee concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 8.3(a) shall be made to Payee promptly following termination of this Agreement (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); and in each case such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

 

 (c) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

 (i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(vi), Parent shall tender or cause to be tendered the Parent Termination Fee to the Company prior to or concurrently with such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company.

 

 (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

 (iii) If Parent becomes obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(c), the Company agrees that its right to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent shall be its sole and exclusive remedy against Parent and the Parent Group and, upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee,

  neither Parent nor any member of the Parent Group shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee, the Second Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 (d) _Expense_ _Reimbursement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(v) under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a), then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay all of ParentÂ’s reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), which amount shall in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent; _provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b) shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.3(d); _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) except to the extent indicated in Section 8.3(b) .

 

 (e) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(c) are not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision; and (iii) without the agreements contained in this Section 8.3, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(d) or if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(d) or any portion thereof, or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by the prevailing Party and its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

 (f) _Limitations on Liabilities_.

  (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Group for damages or otherwise shall be limited to $570,800,000 (the " _Parent Liability Cap_ "). In no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek or permit to be sought on behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any member of the Parent Group other than Parent in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the parties agree that subject to the terms and conditions of the Second Equity Commitment Letter and all of the terms, conditions and limitations of the Limited Guarantee, the Company can cause each of the Funds to provide funds to Parent to the extent provided in the Second Equity Commitment Letter which shall in no event exceed the Parent Liability Cap. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to damages, any member of the Parent Group (other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement and the Limited Guarantee), through Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against the Funds or any other member of the Parent Group, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights to cause each of the Funds (but not any other member of the Parent Group (including any general partner or managing member)) to fund to Parent its commitment to the extent provided in the Second Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and conditions thereof and all of the terms, conditions and limitations of the Limited Guarantee including the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Funds under the Second Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the amount of the Parent Liability Cap and all of the terms, conditions and limitations of the Limited Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against the Funds and any other member of the Parent Group (other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement) in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that both Parent and Merger Sub are newly-formed companies and do not have any material assets except in connection with this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letters. The Company specifically acknowledges the separate corporate existence of each of Parent and Merger Sub. The liabilities of the Parent Group referred to in this paragraph shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include, subject to the Parent Liability Cap and to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company.

 

 (ii) The provisions of this Section 8.3(f) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company and each member of the Parent Group.

 Section 9.5 _Specific_ _Performance; Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. (a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and the Second Equity Commitment Letter by the other (as applicable) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to fully enforce the terms of the Second Equity Commitment Letter against the Funds to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to the Second Equity Commitment Letter and applicable Laws and to thereafter cause the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement.

 (i) The Company hereby agrees that, except as provided in Section 9.5(b)(ii) below, specific performance shall be its sole and exclusive remedy (but for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may plead or otherwise seek monetary damages in the alternative) with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as provided in Section 9.5(b)(ii) below, that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement, the Second Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages).

 

 (ii) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 9.5 the Company may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary damages. If such a court has granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against Parent, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach (which Parent agrees shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include, subject to the Parent Liability Cap and to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain lost by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money)) only if, within two (2) weeks following such award, Parent and Merger Sub have not consummated the Offer and the Merger. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal action or proceeding still pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Offer and the Merger.

 

 (c) In addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters and the Limited Guarantee and the rights and obligations arising hereunder and thereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters and the Limited Guarantee and the rights and obligations arising hereunder or thereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby

  irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters and the
Limited Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letters in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert

exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letters and the

 Section 9.8 _Assignment;_ _Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interest and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and to any parties providing debt financing to the Surviving Corporation for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such debt financing, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder.

This Agreement is not intended to grant and does not grant standing to any person other than the parties except, following the Effective Time, for the provisions of Section 6.7. The representations and warranties set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and (a) may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, each of which contains certain disclosures that are not reflected in the text of this Agreement; and (c) may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by shareholders of, or other investors in, the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

 Section 9.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

THE CAPITALIZED TERMS USED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH 
 IN THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER TO WHICH THIS ANNEX A IS 
 ATTACHED

 

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer (subject to compliance with Section 1.1(a) of the Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act), Merger Sub (1) shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Shares, and (2) may delay the acceptance for payment of or the payment for any tendered Shares on the terms set forth in the Agreement if (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated, (ii) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied or (iii) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, any of the following conditions shall have occurred and continue to exist:

 

 (a) any order, decree, injunction or ruling restraining or enjoining or otherwise materially delaying or preventing the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all of the Shares or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer shall have been issued by a Governmental Entity or any statute, rule or regulation shall have been enacted that prohibits or makes illegal the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all of the Shares;

 

 (b) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.2, Section 4.3(a), Section 4.4(a) or Section 4.5, without giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications, shall not be true and correct in all material respects at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than such representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct in all material respects only as of such time) and (B) all of the remaining representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, without giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications shall not be true and correct at and as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than such representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of another specified time, which shall be true and correct only as of such time) except, with respect to this clause (B), where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

 (c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or obligations to be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

  (d) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company dated as of the date on which the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in the foregoing clauses (b) and (c) do not exist;

 

 (e) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s), event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred, other than as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, which has or have had, individually or in the accurate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

 (f) prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board shall have withdrawn or modified (including by amendment of the Schedule 14D-9) in a manner adverse to Merger Sub the Recommendation or shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change; or

 

 (g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent tenders payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c), then the Offer shall automatically terminate upon the tendering of the Parent Termination Fee with no other action required by any party hereto.

 

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, in each case except for the Minimum Condition; _provided_ that Merger Sub, at its sole option, may waive such Minimum Condition (i) if the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn shall be at least the minimum number of Shares required to approve the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein pursuant to the organizational documents of the Company and the FBCA, less the number of Shares subject to Support Agreements or (ii) with the consent of the Company.
