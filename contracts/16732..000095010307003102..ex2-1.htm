(the " **Closing Inter-Company  Non-Trading Payables** ") (items (i) through

Closing  Items shall be made by applying the principles, policies and

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preparation of the relevant portions of the Balance Sheet, including
the  adjustments, notes and assumptions set forth in Section 3.08 of the
Disclosure  Schedule and shall be accompanied by appropriate information and
documentation  in reasonable detail supporting Buyer's calculations.

 

 

(b) If  Seller  disagrees with Buyer's calculation of any of the Closing
Items delivered  pursuant to Section 2.05(a), Seller may, within 30 days
after delivery of  the  Closing Statement referred to in Section 2.05(a),
deliver a notice to Buyer  disagreeing with such calculation and setting
forth Seller's calculation of such  amount. Any such notice of disagreement
shall specify those items or  amounts as to which Seller disagrees.

 

 

(c) If  a  notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
Section 2.05(b),  Buyer and Seller shall, during the 30 days following such
delivery, use their  reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts  of  the Closing Items. If, during such period,
Buyer and Seller are  unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause an  independent accountant of nationally recognized
standing, reasonably  satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (who shall not have
any material relationship  with Buyer or Seller), promptly to review this
Agreement and the disputed  items  or amounts for the purpose of calculating
the disputed Closing  Items. In making such calculation, such independent
accountant shall  consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Items
as to which Seller  has  disagreed and shall make its determination strictly
in accordance with the  principles, policies and practices used in connection
with the preparation  of  the Balance Sheet, including the adjustments,
notes and assumptions set forth  in  Section 3.08 of the Disclosure
Schedule. Such independent accountant  shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting  forth such calculation, it being
understood that the amount of the disputed  items or amounts calculated by
the independent accountant shall not (i) in  the  case of Closing Cash,
Closing Inter-Company Non-Trading Receivables and Closing  Net Working
Capital, be more than the amount thereof shown in Seller's  calculations
delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b) nor less than the amount  thereof shown
in Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and  (ii) in the
case of Closing External Debt and Closing Inter-Company Non-Trading 
Payables, be more than the amount thereof shown in Buyer's calculations 
delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) nor less than the amount thereof shown 
in  Seller's calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b). Such 
report shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The cost  of such
review and report shall be borne by Buyer if the difference between  the 
Final Closing Items and Buyer's calculation of the Closing Items delivered 
pursuant to Section 2.05(a) is greater than the difference between the Final 
Closing Items and Seller's calculation of the Closing Items delivered
pursuant  to Section 2.05(b), by Seller if the first such difference is less
than the  second such difference and otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Buyer  and  Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent  accountants and each of the Acquired Companies and
the Subsidiary to, cooperate  and assist in the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation  of  the Closing Items and in the conduct of
the audits or reviews referred to  in  Section 2.05(c), including without
limitation, the making available to the  extent necessary of books, records,
work papers and personnel.

(i) Estimated  Closing Cash exceeds Final Closing Cash, Seller shall pay to
Buyer, in the  manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.06(b), the
amount of such  excess. If Final Closing Cash exceeds Estimated Closing Cash,
Buyer  shall pay to Seller in the manner and with interest as provided in
Section  2.06(b), the amount of such excess. " **Final Closing  Cash** "
means Closing Cash as shown in Buyer's calculation delivered  pursuant to
Section 2.05(a), if no notice of disagreement with respect thereto  is duly

investigation pursuant to this  Section 5.02 shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere  unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
Seller or any of its  Affiliates, the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Buyer shall not have access to personnel
records relating to  individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other  information the disclosure of which in Seller's good
faith opinion could subject  Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Acquired
Companies or the Subsidiary to  risk of liability.

 

 

(b) _Access  to Information Following Closing_. From and after the Closing 
Date, Seller will afford promptly to Buyer and its counsel, auditors and
other  authorized representatives reasonable access to its books of account,
financial  and other records, employees and auditors to the extent they
relate to the  Acquired Companies or the Subsidiary and to the extent
necessary to permit  Buyer  to determine any matter relating to its rights
and obligations in connection  with any audit, investigation, dispute or
litigation or any other reasonable  business purpose relating to the Acquired
Companies or the Subsidiary or Buyer's  rights or obligations under any of
the Transaction Documents; _provided_   that any such access by Buyer and its
counsel, auditors and other authorized  representatives shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the  business of Seller, the
Acquired Companies or any other respective  Affiliates.

 

 

Section  5.03 _. Maintenance of Insurance  Policies_ _. _Prior to the
Closing, Seller and its  Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to
maintain insurance policies  for  the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary
and their assets, properties and  employees in an amount and scope consistent
with any such insurance policies  in  effect as of the date of this
Agreement. The Acquired Companies and  the Subsidiary shall after the Closing
continue to have coverage under any  such  insurance policies in effect at
the Closing with respect to, but only with  respect to, occurrences prior to
the Closing (except that, with respect to  claims made policies, the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiary shall have  coverage after the Closing only with
respect to claims made prior to the  Closing), and it is understood that (i)
the Acquired Companies and the  Subsidiary shall continue to be responsible
for amounts (including deductibles)  not covered by such insurance policies
and (ii) the provisions of this Section  5.03 shall not obligate Seller or
any of its Affiliates to pay any money with  respect to any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  policies (including, without limitation, with respect to insurance
policies  in  effect on or prior to the Closing) after the Closing.

 

 

Section  5.04 _. Non-Competition;  Non-Solicitation. _(a) __ For a period of
two years  from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not  to,  (i) directly or indirectly, own any interest in,
manage, control or operate  any  business involving the manufacture,
production, distribution or sale of premium  chocolates other than the
businesses of Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's as operated  substantially in the
manner that such businesses exist on the date hereof or  (ii) own any
interest in, manage, control or operate any retail stores, whether  in
corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, focusing 
principally on the sale of chocolate (the " **Restricted  Businesses** ");
_provided, however,_ that the restrictions  contained in this Section 5.04(a)
shall not restrict or prohibit (i) the  acquisition (and subsequent
ownership, management, control or operation) by  Seller or any of its
Affiliates of a business, whether in corporate,  proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, not principally engaged in  the  Restricted
Business; _provided_ that Seller and its Affiliates will use  commercially
reasonable efforts to divest such Restricted Business as promptly  as
reasonably practicable thereafter or (ii) the acquisition by Seller and 
its  Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than 5% in the aggregate of
the  outstanding capital stock of any company engaged in a Restricted 
Business.

 

 

(b) For  a period of two years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent  of Buyer, Seller shall not, and shall cause its directors,
officers, and  employees not to, directly or indirectly, (i) cause, solicit,
induce or  encourage any executive or management employees of any of the
Acquired Companies  and the Subsidiary as of the Closing Date to leave such
employment or hire,  employ or otherwise engage any such individual;
_provided, however_ , that  the foregoing provision will not prevent Seller
from hiring any such individual  that seeks employment with Seller (x) in
response to general advertisements  that  are not specifically targeted at
executive employees of the Acquired Companies  and the Subsidiary, or (y)
through third party employment agencies that do  not  specifically target
executive or management employees of the Acquired Companies  and the
Subsidiary, or (ii) cause, induce or encourage any actual or prospective 
material supplier or licensor of any of the Acquired Companies and the 
Subsidiary, or any other Person who has a material business relationship
with  any of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary, to terminate or
adversely  modify any such actual relationship or avoid or deny a
prospective  relationship.

 

 

(c)   From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause
their  directors, officers, employees and Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly,  disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other
than authorized  officers, directors and employees of Buyer or use or
otherwise exploit for  its  own benefit, other than as consistent with
Section 5.04(a), or for the benefit  of anyone

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  Buyer, any Confidential Information (as defined below). Seller
shall  not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers,
directors  or Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information
if and to  the  extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by
applicable Law, the rules  of any national securities exchange or any Returns
or other filings required  to  be made with any Taxing Authority;
__provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that in the event disclosure is required  by
applicable  Law, Seller shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide
Buyer with prompt  notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure
so that Buyer may  seek  an appropriate protective order. For purposes of
this Section  5.04(c), " **Confidential Information** " means any information
with  respect to any of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary, including
methods  of operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs,
technology,  inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software, marketing
methods, plans,  personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other
specialized information  or  proprietary matters. " **Confidential
Information** " does  not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder
with respect to,  information that (i) is generally available to the public
on the date of this  Agreement or (ii) becomes generally available to the
public other than as a  result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible
hereunder.

 

 

(d) The  covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 5.04 relate to
matters  which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation  of  any of the terms of this Section 5.04 may cause irreparable
injury to Buyer,  the  amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot  be  adequately compensated. Accordingly, the
remedy at law for any breach  of this Section 5.04 may be inadequate.
Therefore, Buyer will be  entitled to seek temporary and permanent
injunction, restraining order or other  equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction in the event of any  breach of this Section 5.04
without the necessity of proving actual damage  or  posting any bond
whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this  Section 5.04 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies  which Buyer may
have hereunder or at law or in equity.

 

 

(e)   The parties hereto agree that if any provision contained in this
Section 5.04  shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect,  such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other  provisions of this Section 5.04, but this Section 5.04
shall be construed as  if  such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
had never been contained  herein. It is the intention of the parties that if
it is determined  that a specified time period, a specified business
limitation or any other  relevant feature of this Section 5.04 is
unreasonable, arbitrary, against public  policy, or to any extent invalid,
such provision shall not be construed to  be  null, void and of no effect,
but to the extent such provision would be valid  or  enforceable under
applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall  construe and
interpret or reform this Section to provide for a lesser period  of  time,
business limitation or other relevant feature

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary, not
against public  policy, and valid and enforceable under such applicable Law.

 

 

Section  5.05 _. Transition Services. _(a) __ From  and after the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide transition services to Buyer  in  some or all of
the following areas as reasonably requested by Buyer: (1)  information
technology, (2) human resources and benefits, (3) purchasing, (4)  finance
and accounting and (5) real estate administration (each, a " **Transition
Service** " and collectively, the " **Transition  Services** "). The cost for
all of the services to be provided  for each Transition Service will be
billed by Seller to Buyer and will be as  follows:

 

 

(i) information  technology services shall cost $384,000 per month;

 

 

(ii)   human resources and benefits shall cost $100,000 per month for

resources services provided to  employees of the Acquired Companies;

 

 

(iii)   purchasing services costs shall be $37,250 per month;

 

 

(iv)   finance and accounting costs shall be $10,500 per month; and

 

 

(v)   real estate administration costs shall be $5,750 per month.

 

 

(b)   The costs for Transition Services set forth in Section 5.05(a) are 
for all Transition Services that Seller intends to provide. Buyer and  Seller
may mutually agree that only a portion of the Transition Services shall  be
provided to Buyer in which case Seller will reduce the costs associated 
with  such Transition Service in proportion to the amount and type of
Transition  Services that are not provided to Buyer.

 

 

(c)   Seller and Buyer covenant and agree to use reasonable best efforts 
and to work together in good faith to finalize a definitive written
agreement  relating to the provision of Transition Services (the "
**Transition  Services Agreement** ") promptly after the date hereof. As
part  of such discussions the parties will work in good faith to reach a
mutually  agreeable arrangement with respect to reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred  with respect to the provision of Transition Services. The
Transition  Services Agreement will reflect that:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i)   the nature, quality, scope and standard of care with respect to
Seller's  delivery of Transition Services shall be substantially identical to
the services  provided by Seller or its Affiliates to the Acquired Companies
as of the date  hereof (subject to any company wide changes made by Seller or
its Affiliates  with respect to services included in the Transition
Services);

 

 

(ii)   the Transition Services will be provided at volumes or levels
necessary for  the  Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary to conduct their
business consistent  with  the 2008 fiscal year projections provided to
Buyer;

 

 

(iii)   Seller and Buyer shall mutually agree on the period during which
Buyer may  request the provision of each Transition Service duration of each
Transition  Service; _provided_ that no __ Transition Service shall be 
required to be provided for a period of more than twelve (12) months from
the  Closing Date;

 

 

(iv)   Seller shall have the right, in its sole discretion but subject to
providing  Buyer with prior notice, to satisfy its obligation to provide or
procure  Transition Services by causing one or more of its Affiliates or one
or more  subcontractors to provide or procure such Transition Services;
_provided_   that Seller shall remain liable for the performance of such
Transition Services  by any of its Affiliates or subcontractors;

 

 

(v)   Seller shall not be obligated to provide or procure Transition Services
where  the consent of a third Person is reasonably required for the provision
of such  Transition Services; _provided_ that Seller and Buyer shall use 
reasonable best efforts to obtain, at no cost to Seller, such consents;  and

 

 

(vi)   the Transition Services shall be subject to customary terms and 
limitations regarding liability, indemnification, damages and billing
procedures  to be agreed by Seller and Buyer.

 

 

(d)   In addition to the Transition Services to be provided or procured by
Seller  or  its Affiliates in accordance with this Section 5.05, if
requested by Buyer,  and  to the extent that Seller and the Buyer may
mutually agree, Seller or its  Affiliates shall provide additional services
to the Buyer. The Seller  shall consider in good faith and not unreasonably
deny any request made by  Buyer  pursuant to this Section 5.05(d). The scope
of any such additional  services, as well as the term, costs, and other terms
and conditions applicable  to such additional services, shall be as mutually
agreed by Seller and  Buyer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)   If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach a definitive written agreement
with  respect to Transition Services, Seller will, at Buyer's request and
consistent  with the principles set forth in this Section 5.05, provide
Transition Services  to Buyer on commercially reasonable and customary terms
and at the costs set  forth in Section 5.05(a).

 

 

Section  5.06 _. Third Party Consents. _Seller and Buyer  shall, and Seller
shall cause the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary to,  use,  their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable  date 
all material consents, waivers and approvals from, and provide all notices 
to,  all Persons that are not a governmental body in connection with the

the Acquired Companies and the  Subsidiary) shall be required to pay any
amounts in connection with obtaining  any consent, waiver or approval and

to Buyer and Buyer shall give notice to Seller, as promptly  as  reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change, condition, 
circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused or is 
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement 
made  by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect at any time after the
date  hereof and prior to the Closing, (b) any material failure on its part
to comply  with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or  satisfied by it hereunder or (c) the institution of or the
threat of institution  of any legal proceeding against any of Seller, the
Acquired Companies or the  Subsidiary related to this Agreement or the

pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall  not  limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party  receiving such notice, or the
representations or warranties of, or the  conditions to the obligations of,
the parties hereto.

Agreement  dated September 25, 2007 between Buyer and Campbell (the "
**Confidentiality Agreement** "), which agreement shall remain in  full force

Identified Store, then, for each such Identified Store in excess of five (5) 
Identified Stores for which consent is not obtained and a Loss of Space
occurs,  Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount specified on item #2
of Section  7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ the Party in Interest
has no  basis for terminating the applicable lease as a result of any action
taken  by  Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiary)  after the

Closing  Date. Seller or its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause the 
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary not to, agree or consent to any 
modification of any lease of an Identified Store without the prior written 
consent of Buyer. It is understood and agreed that with respect to  all
leases for Identified Stores (i) under no circumstances will the inability 
to renew or extend a lease for an Identified Store by the Acquired Companies 
or  the Subsidiary at the end of the current term give rise to a payment
obligation  by Seller under this Section 7.05 and (ii) that any consent
received with  respect to a lease for an Identified Store shall be in writing
and in form  and  substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

Section  8.02 _. Filing of Returns and Other Tax Covenants. _(a) The
parties  acknowledge  and agree that, for U.S.  federal income Tax
purposes,  the taxable years of the U.S. Acquired Company and the Subsidiary
will close  as  of the end of the Closing Date. Seller shall include  all
items of income, gain,  loss, deduction and credit of the U.S. Acquired
Company and the  Subsidiary attributable  to the short  period that ends on
the Closing Date in, and shall timely file  or cause to
be timely filed,  the U.S. consolidated  federal income Returns  of
the  Seller Group  and shall  be responsible for the  payment of any Taxes
due with respect thereto. With respect to income  or franchise Taxes other
than U.S. federal income Taxes, the parties agree  to  take all reasonable
actions as may be required to close the taxable  period of the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiary as of the close of business  on the Closing
Date, and, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller  shall be
responsible for filing any Return for any short taxable period that  ends on
the Closing Date and shall pay any and  all Taxes due  with respect to such
Returns. All Returns  described in  this Section  8.02(a) shall be 
prepared in a manner consistent with  prior  practice. Seller shall
provide Buyer  with copies of the portions  of such Returns  that relate
to the U.S.  Acquired Company and the Subsidiary at least forty-five  (45)
days prior  to the due date (including  extensions) for  filing thereof
for Buyer's  review. If Buyer objects  to any  portion of such Returns,
Seller and Buyer  shall attempt in good faith  to resolve any disagreements
prior to the due date for filing. In the  event that Seller  and Buyer  are
unable to resolve any  dispute with respect to such Return at least ten (10)
days prior to the due  date  for filing, such dispute shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 8.06(h),  which resolution shall be  binding on the
parties.

 

 

(b)   Seller shall timely  file or cause to be timely filed all Returns of
the Acquired Companies and  the  Subsidiary due on or before the Closing
Date and shall pay all Taxes shown  as  due on such Returns. Seller shall
timely file or cause to be timely  filed all Returns of the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiary due after the  Closing Date that include only
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing  Date, and shall pay all
Taxes shown as due on such  Returns. All Returns  described in
this Section  8.02(b) shall be  prepared in a manner consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  practice. Seller shall provide Buyer  with copies of such Returns
at  least forty-five  (45) days prior  to the due date (including 
extensions) for  filing thereof for Buyer's  review. If Buyer objects  to
any  portion of such Returns, Seller and Buyer  shall attempt in good
faith  to resolve any disagreements prior to the due date for filing. In
the  event that Seller  and Buyer  are unable to resolve any  dispute with
respect to such Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due  date  for
filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 8.06(h),  which
resolution shall be  binding on the parties.

 

 

(c) Buyer  shall timely file  or cause to be  timely filed all  Returns
(other than those Returns described in Section 8.02(a) or  (b)) required to
be filed  by each Acquired Company and the Subsidiary after the  Closing
Date and,  subject to the right to payment from Seller  under Section
8.06, shall pay  or cause to be paid all  Taxes shown as due  thereon.
With respect  to any Return  covering a taxable period that begins before
but ends after the Closing Date,  such Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice  and shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller at
least forty-five (45) days prior  to  the due date (including extensions) of
such Return for Seller's  review. If  Seller objects to any portion of such
Returns, Seller and Buyer  shall attempt in good faith  to resolve any
disagreements regarding such Returns prior to the due date for  filing. In
the event that Seller and  Buyer are unable  to resolve any  dispute with
respect to such Return at least ten (10) days  prior to the due date  for
filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 8.06(h),  which
resolution shall be  binding on the parties.

 

 

(d) Not  later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for the payment of
Taxes on  any  Returns that Buyer has the responsibility to cause to be
filed pursuant to  Section 8.02(c), Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of
Taxes owed by Seller  pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.06. No payment
pursuant to  this Section 8.02(d) shall excuse Seller from its
indemnification obligations  pursuant to Section 8.06 if the amount of Taxes
pursuant to a Final  Determination for the Pre-Closing Tax Period covered by
any such Return exceeds  the amount of Seller's payment under this Section
8.02(d) with respect to the  Return. If a dispute arises with respect to a
Return or the amount of  Taxes for which Seller is responsible and is not
resolved at least ten (10)  days  prior to the due date of the Return,
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount that  Buyer deems to be due and owing
(and the Return shall be filed in the manner  that Buyer deems correct);
_provided, however,_ that if the independent  accounting firm resolving the
dispute pursuant to Section 8.06(h) determines  that the amount of Taxes that
are the responsibility of Seller differs from  the  amount paid to Buyer,
Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to Seller,  the amount
necessary to reflect the independent accounting firm's determination  plus
interest at the Reference Rate. Buyer shall cause each Acquired  Company and
the Subsidiary to file any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended  Returns permitted by Law to reflect the final determination by the
independent  accounting firm and pay the Taxes shown as due on any such
Return.

 

 

(e)   Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements between any Acquired
Company or  the  Subsidiary and any member of the Seller Group shall be
terminated as of the  Closing Date. After such date neither any Acquired
Company nor the  Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller, on the  other  hand, shall have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

 

 

Section  8.03 _. Transfer Taxes. _All transfer, filing,  recording,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes  and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with 
the  purchase and sale of the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Agreement 
(including any real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be
shared  equally by Buyer and Seller, each of whom shall indemnify and hold
harmless  each  other from its share of such Taxes and shall cooperate in
filing all necessary  Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes and  fees. Each of Seller and Buyer will, and will cause its
Affiliates  to, join in the execution of any Returns and other documentation
as may required  by Law. In particular, with respect to the shares of Godiva
France  SA, Buyer shall register the Short Form Stock Purchase Agreement with
the French  Tax Administration no later than thirty (30) days after the
Closing  Date. In addition, no later than ten (10) days from the date of 
registration with the French Tax Administration, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller  an original of the Short Form Stock Purchase Agreement duly
registered as proof  of compliance with the registration formalities as
required by French  law. __

 

 

Section  8.04 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters. _Buyer and  Seller agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,  as  promptly
as practicable, such information (including access to books and  records) and
assistance relating to any Acquired Company or the Subsidiary  as is 
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Return, for the preparation for 
any  audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding  relating to any proposed adjustment. Buyer and Seller agree to
retain  or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to any
Acquired Company  and the Subsidiary until the applicable period for
assessment under applicable  Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or
waivers) has expired, and to  abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered  into  with any Taxing Authority. Each Acquired
Company and the Subsidiary  agrees to give Seller reasonable notice prior to
transferring, discarding or  destroying any such books and records relating
to Tax matters and, if Seller  so  requests, the Acquired Company or the
Subsidiary shall allow Seller to take  possession of such books and records.
Buyer and Seller shall  cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit
or other proceedings  involving any Acquired Company or the Subsidiary for
any Tax

purposes  and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents  as are necessary to carry out the intent of this subsection.

 

 

Section  8.05 _. Section 338(h)(10) Election. _(a) Upon the request  of
Buyer, Seller shall join with Buyer in making an election under Section 
338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and any corresponding or 
similar elections under state or local tax law with respect to the U.S.
Acquired  Company (and the Subsidiary if designated by Buyer) (collectively,
the " **Section 338(h)(10) Election** "). Any such request  shall be made by
Buyer in writing no later than thirty (30) days from the  Closing Date.

 

 

(b)   Except as provided in Section 8.05(d), Buyer shall be responsible for
the  preparation and filing of all forms and documents required to effectuate
the  Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall execute (or cause to be 
executed) and deliver to Buyer a Form 8023 and such additional documents or 
forms as are reasonably requested to complete properly the Section
338(h)(10)  Election at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Section
338(h)(10)  Election is to be filed.

 

 

(c)   Buyer and Seller shall file, and shall cause their Affiliates to file,
all  Returns and statements, forms and schedules in connection therewith in a
manner  consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no
position  contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Law.

 

 

(d)   Within thirty (30) days after notifying the Seller of its intent to
make a  Section 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the  " **Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement** ") allocating
the ADSP  (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4)
(the " **Aggregate Deemed** **Sales Price** ") of the assets  of the U.S.
Acquired Company (and, if applicable, the Subsidiary) in accordance  with the
Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section  338(h)(10). Seller shall have
the right to review the Section  338(h)(10) Allocation Statement. If within
thirty (30) days after  receipt of the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement Seller notifies Buyer  in  writing that the allocation of one or
more items reflected in the Section  338(h)(10) Allocation Statement is not a
reasonable allocation, Buyer and Seller  will negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If no such  notice is received from Seller, Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed to the  Section 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement. If a notice is received and  Buyer and Seller fail to resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) days, such  resolution shall be resolved pursuant
to Section 8.06(h), which resolution  shall  be binding on the parties. The
Section 338(h)(10) Allocation  Statement shall be adjusted as required by Law
pursuant to the above  procedures. Buyer and Seller agree to act in
accordance with the  Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement in the
preparation, filing and audit  of  any Return.

Section  8.06 _. Indemnification Provisions. _(a) Seller hereby  indemnifies
Buyer against and agrees to hold it harmless from (i) any Taxes  (other than
transfer Taxes, which are specifically addressed in Section 8.03  hereof) of
any Acquired Company or the Subsidiary relating to any and all  Pre-Closing
Tax Periods; (ii) any Taxes resulting from, arising out of, based  on  or
relating to the Section 338(h)(10) Election (for the avoidance of doubt, 
Taxes for this purpose shall not include any reduction in any Tax Asset (or 
increase in Taxes as a result of such reduction) of Buyer or any of its 
Affiliates as a result of a redetermination of the Aggregate Deemed Sales
Price  agreed to by Buyer and Seller or pursuant to a Final Determination);
(iii)  any  Taxes resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to,
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement as a result of Seller
failing to pay any such  Taxes for which the Seller has primary liability;
(iv) any Taxes of an Acquired  Company or of the Subsidiary resulting from a
breach of the representations  in  Section 8.01 hereof; and (v) liabilities,
costs and expenses (including, without  limitation, reasonable expenses of
investigation and attorneys' fees and  expenses), arising out of or incident
to the imposition, assessment or assertion  of any Tax described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),  including those incurred in the
contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings  relating to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each  case incurred or suffered
by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon  the  Closing, any
Acquired Company or the Subsidiary; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller
shall be obligated to make payments to Buyer  pursuant to this Section
8.06(a) only to the extent that the amount that would  otherwise be payable
by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.06(a) in respect  of  any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary (notwithstanding this proviso) exceeds the  aggregate
amount of the provisions for Taxes reflected on _Exhibit B_ as of  the
Closing Date attributable to that Acquired Company or  Subsidiary.

 

 

(b)   For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes of any Acquired Company and the
Subsidiary  that relate to any taxable period that includes but does not end
on the Closing  Date (a " **Straddle Period** ") will be apportioned between
the  period of the Straddle Period that begins before the Closing Date and
ends  on  the Closing Date (the " **Pre-Closing Straddle Period** ") and
the  period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the
Closing Date  to the end of the Straddle Period (the " **Post-Closing
Straddle  Period** ") in accordance with this Section 8.06(b). The  portion
of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall (i)  in 
the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, 
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on, or measured by 
income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, shall be deemed 
equal to the amount that would be payable for the entire taxable period 
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the  Pre-Closing Straddle Period, and denominator of which is the number of
days  in  the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use
taxes, value-added  taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax
based on or measured  by  income, receipts

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  profits  earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount
that would be  payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the
Closing  Date. For purposes of this Section 8.06(b), any exemption,
deduction,  credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis will
be allocated  to  the Pre-Closing Straddle Period on a pro rata basis by
multiplying the total  amount of such items for the Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of  which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period, and  the  denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle  Period. The portion of Tax attributable to a
Post-Closing Straddle  Period shall be calculated in a corresponding manner.

 

 

(c)   Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit any Acquired Company,
the  Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Buyer, except for the making of the
Section  338(h)(10) Election, (i) to take any action on the Closing Date
other than  in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to
the  distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, that
could  give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset of the Seller
Group  or  give rise to any loss of the Seller or the Seller Group under
this  Agreement, (ii) to make any election or deemed election under Section 
338(g) of the Code (other than any Section 338(g) election that is a result 
of  the Section 338(h)(10) Election) or any comparable provision under
applicable  Law with respect to any Acquired Company or the Subsidiary, or
(iii) to  make or change any Tax election or amend any Return that results in
any  increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of Seller or the
Seller  Group in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer further 
covenants that it will not cause or permit any Acquired Company, the
Subsidiary  or any Affiliate of Buyer to take any action that (iv) would have
the  effect with respect to the Seller or any of its Affiliates of reducing 
accumulated earnings and profits as determined under Section 1248 of the
Code  of  any Acquired Company that is a controlled foreign corporation for
U.S. federal  income tax purposes or (v) is outside the ordinary course of
business and  that could result in the recognition by Seller or any of its
Affiliates of  income or greater amounts of income under Section 951 of the
Code than they  would otherwise realize if a closing of the books had taken
place on the Closing  Date. Notwithstanding Section 8.06(a), Buyer agrees
that Seller is to  have no liability for any Tax resulting from any action
referred to in clauses  (i) to (v) of this Section 8.06(c), and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless  Seller and its Affiliates against (x) any such
Tax resulting from such actions,  (y) any Tax incurred or suffered by Seller
or any of its Affiliates, arising  out  of a breach of any other covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this  Article 8, and (z) any liabilities,
costs, expenses (including, without  limitation, reasonable expenses of
investigation and attorney's fees and  expenses), losses, damages,
assessments, settlements or judgments arising out  of  or incident to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described  in  clause (x) or
(y) above, including those incurred in the contest in good faith  in
appropriate proceedings relating to the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposition,  assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each case incurred
or suffered  by  Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

 

(d)   Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refunds of
Taxes  and  interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, any
Acquired  Company, or the Subsidiary attributable to Taxes paid by Seller,
any Acquired  Company or the Subsidiary (or any predecessor or Affiliate of
Seller) with  respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to the extent
that such refund  was not reflected in the Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date on  _Exhibit B_. If, in lieu of receiving any such refund, any 
Acquired Company or the Subsidiary reduces a Tax liability with respect to 
a  Post-Closing Tax Period or increases a Tax Asset that can be carried
forward  to  a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to
be paid to  Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax liability or the
amount of any  benefit resulting from such increase in Tax Assets, as the
case may  be. The benefit resulting from an increase in a Tax Asset shall
be  calculated on the same basis as applicable to Tax Benefits pursuant to
Section  8.06(e).

 

 

(e)   If Seller's indemnification obligation under this Section 8.06 arises
in respect  of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or,  effective upon the Closing, any Acquired Company or the
Subsidiary any  deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other
allowance which would  not, but for such adjustment, be allowable (a " **Tax
Benefit** "),  then any payment by Seller to Buyer shall be an amount equal
to (x) the amount  otherwise due but for this Section 8.06(e), minus (y) the
present value of  the  Tax Benefit multiplied by the maximum federal, state,
or foreign, as the case  may be, corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the
relevant adjustment is  made  or, in the case of a credit, by 100 percent.
The present value referred to  in  the preceding sentence shall be
determined using a discount rate equal to the  mid-term applicable U.S.
federal rate in effect at the time the relevant  adjustment is made and
assuming that the Tax Benefit will be used at the  earliest date or dates
allowable by applicable Law. For the avoidance  of doubt, any adjustment that
is not amortizable, depreciable or deductible  shall not be considered a Tax
Benefit and no Tax Benefit will be  deemed realized with respect to the U.S.
Acquired Company or the Subsidiary  if a  338(h)(10) Election is made
(pursuant to Section 8.05 of this Agreement) with  respect thereto.

 

 

(f)   Any payment by Buyer or Seller pursuant to this Article 8 shall be made
not  later than thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller or Buyer of written
notice  from the other. Such notice shall state the specific Tax that has 
been paid by Buyer, Seller, or any of its respective Affiliates, the amount 
thereof and the indemnity payment requested.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g)   If any claim (including any audit) or demand with respect to Taxes is
received  by either party for which the other party may reasonably be
expected to be  liable pursuant to this Section 8.06 (a " **Tax Claim** "),
the party  receiving such claim or demand (the " **Tax Indemnified Party**
")  shall promptly notify the other party (the " **Tax Indemnifying  Party**
") in writing of such Tax Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure
to give the Tax Indemnifying  Party notice as  provided herein shall not
relieve the Tax Indemnifying Party of its obligations  under this Section
8.06 except to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party  is  actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. The Tax Indemnifying  Party shall have the
right, at its own expense, to defend any Tax Claim;  _provided_ that the Tax
Indemnified Party shall have the right to  participate in the audit or
defense of such Tax Claim and to be consulted with  respect thereto, and the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall not settle a Tax Claim  without the consent of
the Tax Indemnified Party if such settlement would have  an adverse effect on
the Tax Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall have no right to defend (but may  participate in) any Tax Claim
with respect to Seller Group's consolidated U.S.  federal, state or local
income Return. In the event that the Tax  Indemnifying Party fails to
prosecute a Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnified Party  may, upon notice to and at
the expense of the Tax Indemnifying Party, assume  the  defense of any such
Tax Claim.

 

 

(h)   Any dispute as to any matter covered in this Article 8 shall be
resolved by  an  independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller
and  Buyer. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne 
equally by Seller and Buyer. If any dispute with respect to a Return  is not
resolved prior to the due date for filing such Return, such Return shall  be
filed in the manner which the party responsible for preparing such Return 
deems correct.

 

 

Section  8.07 _. Canadian Withholding and Section 116  Certificate._ Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a certificate issued  pursuant to section 116 of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (the " **ITA** ") **** in respect of the sale of
the  shares of Godiva Chocolatier of Canada LTD (the " **Canadian  Shares**
") to Buyer, _provided_ that:

 

 

(a)   if a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue pursuant
to  subsection 116(2) of the ITA in respect of the disposition of the
Canadian  Shares to Buyer, specifying a certificate limit in an amount which
is not less  than the portion of the Closing Payment allocable to the
Canadian Shares, is  not  delivered to Buyer at or before the Closing, Buyer
shall be entitled to withhold  from the Closing Payment payable to Seller at
the Closing 25% of the portion  of  the Closing Payment allocable to the
Canadian Shares,

 

 

(b)   if, prior to the 29th day after the end of the month in which the
Closing occurs  (or such later time if the Canada Revenue Agency confirms in

writing  and in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer that Buyer may
continue  to  hold the amount withheld pursuant to Section 8.07(a) hereof),
Seller delivers  to  Buyer:

 

 

(i)   a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under
subsection 116(2)  of the ITA in respect of the disposition of the Canadian
Shares to Buyer, Buyer  shall promptly pay to Seller the lesser of (i) the
amount withheld pursuant  to  Section 8.07(a) hereof and (ii) the amount
withheld pursuant to Section 8.07(a)  hereof less 25% of the amount, if any,
by which the portion of the Closing  Payment allocable to the Canadian Shares
exceeds the amount specified in such  certificate as the certificate limit,
together with any interest earned on  the  amount so withheld to the date of
such payment (less any applicable withholding  Tax), or

 

 

(ii)   a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under
subsection 116(4)  of the ITA in respect of the disposition of the Canadian
Shares to Buyer, Buyer  shall promptly pay the amount withheld pursuant to
Section 8.07(a) hereof to  Seller, together with any interest earned thereon
(less any applicable  withholding Tax), and

 

 

(c)   if Buyer has withheld an amount pursuant to Section 8.07(a) hereof and
Seller  does not deliver to the Buyer, prior to the 29th day after the end of
the month  in which the Closing occurs (or such later time if the Canada
Revenue Agency  confirms in writing and in a form that is reasonably
acceptable to Buyer that  Buyer may continue to hold the amount withheld
pursuant to Section 8.07(a)  hereof):

 

 

(i)   a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under
subsection 116(2)  of the ITA in respect of the disposition of the Canadian
Shares to Buyer  specifying a certificate limit equal to or greater than the
portion of the  Closing Payment allocable to the Canadian Shares, or

 

 

(ii)   a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under
subsection 116(4)  of the ITA in respect of the disposition of the Canadian
Shares to  Buyer,

 

 

Buyer  shall remit to the Receiver General of Canada the amount required to
be remitted  pursuant to subsection 116(5) of the ITA (and the amount so
remitted shall  be  credited to the Buyer as a payment to Seller on account
of the Closing Payment)  and Buyer shall pay to Seller any remaining portion
of the amount withheld  pursuant to Section 8.07(a) hereof, together with
interest earned on the amount  withheld pursuant to Section 8.07(a) hereof,
prior to such remittance (less

any  applicable withholding Tax). Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer for any 
Tax for which Buyer is assessed as a consequence of failure to timely remit 
amounts withheld under Section 8.07(a) due to reliance on the written 
confirmation from the Canadian Revenue Agency (as referred to in Section
8.07(b)  and (c) of this Agreement). This Section 8.07 shall apply with
such  modifications as are necessary to any adjustments to the Closing 
Payment.

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  9**

 

**Employee  Matters**

 

 

Section  9.01. _Employees._ Buyer acknowledges that it shall continue  the
employment of all of the employees of the Acquired Companies and the 
Subsidiary (other than employees receiving long-term disability benefits) as 
of  the Closing Date (collectively, the " **Transferred  Employees** ").

 

 

Section  9.02 _. Employee Benefits. _(a) For a period of at least  12 months
(or 18 months in the case of Transferred Employees located in Europe) 
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall procure that each Transferred
Employee  shall be employed on terms and conditions (whether contractual or
otherwise)  and  provided with employee benefits that are comparable in the
aggregate to those  provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date;  and shall provide each Transferred Employee with cash
compensation that is  comparable to the cash compensation of such Transferred
Employee immediately  prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(b)   With respect to those Employee Plans and International Plans in which 
Transferred Employees were, immediately prior to the Closing Date, entitled 
to  participate that are not sponsored by an Acquired Company (the "
**Seller  Plans** "), such Transferred Employees shall, effective as of the
Closing  Date, cease to participate in and accrue benefits thereunder.
Buyer  shall establish or designate or cause the relevant Acquired Company to
establish  employee benefits plans for the benefit of Transferred Employees
(the " **Buyer Plans** ") that provide benefits that satisfy the 
requirements of Section 9.02(a). Buyer shall give Transferred  Employees full
credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit  accrual (other
than benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan) under the  Buyer Plans as
was recognized under the Seller Plans. As between the  Seller Plans and the
Buyer Plans, the Seller Plans shall be responsible for  all  claims for
benefits incurred by Transferred Employees under the Seller Plans  up  to
the Closing Date, and Buyer Plans shall be responsible for all claims for 
benefits incurred by Transferred Employees on and after the Closing  Date.

 

 

(c)   With respect to any Buyer Plans that are welfare benefit plans, Buyer
shall  (i)  cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing  condition limitations and (ii) give effect to, in determining any
deductible  and  maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such
Transferred Employees  with respect to similar plans maintained by Seller.

 

 

(d)   Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cover Transferred
Employees  located in the United States under one or more defined
contribution plans and  trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code  (collectively, the " **Buyer DC Plan** "). To the
extent  relevant, Buyer shall permit such Transferred Employees to make a
"direct  rollover" of their account balances (including loan account
balances) under the  Seller's defined contribution plans that are Employee
Plans to the Buyer DC  Plan. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in
good faith to  effect such transfers or distributions as soon as practicable
after the Closing  Date.

 

 

(e)   Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or designate or
shall  cause Godiva Canada to establish a retirement savings plan for the
benefit  of  Transferred Employees of Godiva Canada (the " **Buyer  RSP**
"). The Buyer RSP shall provide benefits to Transferred  Employees of Godiva
Canada that are comparable in the aggregate to the benefits  such Transferred
Employees received under the Pension Plan for Employees of  Campbell Company
of Canada.

 

 

(f)   Buyer shall, for a period of at least 12 months (or 18 months in the
case of  Transferred Employees located in Europe) following the Closing Date,
maintain  a  severance pay practice, program or arrangement for the benefit
of each  Transferred Employee that provides for the severance benefits set
forth on  Section 9.02(f) of the Disclosure Schedule or, if better, the
severance benefits  provided under Buyer's severance pay practice, program or
arrangement for the  benefit of its similarly situated employees.

 

 

(g)   With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any
Transferred  Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy applicable
to such  Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "
**Vacation Policy** "), Buyer shall allow such Transferred Employee  to use
such accrued vacation; _provided, however_ , that if Buyer deems it 
necessary to disallow such employee from taking such accrued vacation, Buyer 
shall be liable for and pay in cash to each such Transferred Employee an
amount  equal to such vacation time in accordance with the terms of the
Vacation Policy;  _provided, further,_ that Buyer shall be liable for and pay
in cash an  amount equal to such accrued vacation time to any Transferred
Employee whose  employment terminates for any reason other than cause prior
to the close of  business on the last calendar day of the year during which
the Closing Date  occurs, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

 

(h)   On and for 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause  the  Acquired Companies and the Subsidiary not to, implement any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  terminations, layoffs or hours reductions or take any other
action that could  reasonably be expected to result in the Seller, Campbell
or any of their  Affiliates having a liability under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining  Notification Act of 1988 (" **WARN** ") or a similar State or
foreign  Law as the result of a "mass layoff" or a "plant closing" as such
terms are  defined by WARN or as the result of a similar event under such
State or foreign  Law.

 

 

(i)   Buyer shall be solely responsible for satisfying the obligations
imposed under  Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA
(collectively, " **COBRA** ") (or any similar obligation under any applicable
Law)  with respect to all Transferred Employees.

 

 

(j)   For each Transferred Employee who is eligible to participate in a long-
term  incentive plan or program maintained or sponsored by Seller or one of
the  Acquired Companies, Buyer shall provide a comparable long-term
incentive  compensation opportunity, or provide an offsetting cash payment to
any  Transferred Employee whose eligibility is not so maintained. For 
Transferred Employees whose eligibility to receive long-term incentive 
compensation is maintained by Buyer pursuant to the preceding
sentence, "comparable" shall mean a target long-term incentive level of at
least 85% of  Seller's or any Acquired Company's level as of the Closing Date
for a period of  12 months (or 18 months in the case of Transferred Employees
located in  Europe).

 

 

(k)   The provisions of this Article 9 shall apply to and in respect of the 
Transferred Employees only for so long as the Transferred Employees continue 
in  the employment of the Buyer, any Acquired Company, the Subsidiary, any
Affiliate  or any person to whom the whole or any part of the Acquired
Companies is  transferred.

 

 

(l)   The provisions of this Article 9 are solely for the benefit of the
parties  to  this Agreement, and Buyer agrees that if Buyer is in breach of
any of the  provisions of this Article 9, Seller may, at its discretion, and
without  limitation, seek to procure compliance with such provisions by Buyer
by applying  to the court for damages and/or specific performance; provided,
however, that  no  employee or former employee of any of the Acquired
Companies or the Subsidiary  shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of the  Agreement.

against whom such indemnity  may  be sought prior to such time.

 

 

Section  11.02 _. Indemnification_ _. _(a) From and after  Closing, Seller
hereby indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates (including the  Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiary) against and agrees to hold each of them

without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable

from  Seller and its Affiliates, and the procedures set forth in Section 8.06
shall  govern any claim for indemnification under such provision.

 

 

Section  11.03 _. Procedures_ _. _(a) Other than with respect  to an
indemnification claim for Taxes (which shall be governed by Article 8),  the
party seeking indemnification under Section 11.02 (the " **Indemnified 
Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice to the party against whom  indemnity
is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") of the assertion  of any claim, or
the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding  (" **Claim** ") in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under  such Section and will provide
the Indemnifying Party such information with  respect thereto that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably  request. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not  relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the  extent such failure shall have
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying  Party.

 

 

(b)   The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of any  Claim asserted by any third party (" **Third Party Claim** ") and, 
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.03, shall be
entitled  to  control the defense of such Third Party Claim and appoint lead
counsel for  such  defense, in each case at its expense.

 

 

(c)   If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of
any Third  Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section
11.03,  (1) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of
the  Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or  delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim,
if  the  settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and  obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the
settlement imposes  injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party and (2)  the  Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third  Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such  purpose. The fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be paid  by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such  Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with  separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (i) so  requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii)
in the  reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential  conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party that  would make such separate representation advisable.

 

 

(d)   Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate,  in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or  cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony,
and attend such  conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or
appeals, as may be  reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)   Each Indemnified Party must mitigate to the extent required under
applicable  Law  any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this  Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates
its loss after the  Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under
any indemnification  provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the
Indemnified Party  must  notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent  of  the value of the benefit to the
Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less  the  Indemnified Party's
reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days  after the benefit
is received.

 

 

(f)   Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect any
amounts  available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged
to be  responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

 

 

Section  11.04 _. Limitation on Damages_ _. _(a) The amount  of any Damages
payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall  be  net of (1)
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under  applicable
insurance policies (net of any deductibles) and (2) any Tax Benefit  (as
defined in Section 8.06(e)) available to the Indemnified Party arising 
from  the incurrence or payment of any such Damages; _provided_ , that, in
the  case of clause (1), the Indemnified Party shall assert and pursue its
rights  under applicable insurance policies and if the Indemnified Party
recovers  amounts under any applicable insurance policies after the
Indemnifying Party  has  paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this  Agreement, the Indemnified Party must
notify the Indemnifying Party and pay  to  the Indemnifying Party the extent
of such recovery.

 

 

(b)   The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any
(1)  Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) there is included
in  the  Closing Statement an identifiable liability or reserve (including
liabilities  or  reserves that are not individual line items, but are
identifiable components  of  a line item) relating to such matter (it being
understood that the Indemnifying  Party shall be liable for the excess of the
Damages over such identifiable  liability or reserve) or (B) the Indemnified
Party had otherwise been  compensated for such matter pursuant to the Closing
Payment adjustment mechanism  contemplated by Section 2.05 and Section 2.06
(it being understood that the  Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for
the excess of the Damages over  such  Closing Payment adjustment
compensation), (2) special, punitive, indirect or  consequential Damages
(including diminution in value of the Shares) or (3)  Damages for lost
profits.

 

 

Section  11.05 _. Assignment of Claims_ _. _If the  Indemnified Party
receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect  of  any Damages
pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have  recovered all
or a part of such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Damages  from a third party (other than from Buyer, Seller, the Acquired
Companies,  the  Subsidiary, or any Affiliate of or any current or former
employee or agent  of  any such Persons) (a " **Potential Contributor** ")
based on the  underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party  shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential Contributor  as  are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from the Potential  Contributor the amount of such payment.

 

 

Section  11.06 _. Exclusivity_ _. _Except as  specifically set forth in this
Agreement and with respect to fraud and  intentional misrepresentation, Buyer
waives any rights and claims Buyer and  its  Affiliates may have against
Seller and its Affiliates, whether in law or in  equity, relating to the
Acquired Companies or the Subsidiary or any of their  respective assets,
business or operations, the Shares or the transactions  contemplated hereby,
and Seller waives any such rights and claims Seller and  its  Affiliates may
have against Buyer and its Affiliates, the Acquired Companies  or  the
Subsidiary. The rights and claims waived hereby include claims  for
contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to  any 
Environmental Law, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation 
or  warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach
of  duty. After the Closing, Article 8 and Section 11.02 will provide the 
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or 
other agreement (other than those contained in Section 2.06, Section 5.02
and  Section 6.02), or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood  that nothing herein shall prohibit any party hereto from
exercising its rights  to seek equitable relief with respect to a breach of
covenant or agreement  under  any Transaction Document.

 

 

Section  11.07 _. Closing Payment Adjustment. _Any amount  paid by Seller or
Buyer under Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an  adjustment to the
Closing Payment.

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  12**

 

**Termination**

 

 

Section  12.01 _. Grounds for Termination_ _. _This  Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated herein may be  abandoned at any
time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a)   by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

 

(b)  by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been
consummated  by April 18, 2008 (the " **Termination Date** "); _provided_  
that neither

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  parties may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause if the
Closing  shall not have been consummated by the Termination Date by reason of
the failure  of such party or any of its Affiliates to perform in all
material respects  any  of its or their respective covenants or agreements
contained in this  Agreement;

 

 

(c)   by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, if a
material  breach of any provision of this Agreement has been committed by the
other party  or any of its Affiliates and such breach is not capable of being
satisfied  or  cured by the Termination Date or if any representation or
warranty of the other  party has become untrue such that the conditions set
forth in Article 10 hereof  would not be satisfied and such breach is
incapable of being cured;  or

 

 

(d)   by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the Closing would violate
any  nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any court or
governmental  body  having competent jurisdiction.

 

 

The  party  desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.01(b)-(d) shall  give  notice of such termination to the other party.

 

 

Section  12.02 _. Effect of Termination_ _. _If this  Agreement is
terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall  be 
without liability of any party (or any Affiliate, stockholder, director, 
officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to any 
other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall 
result from the (1) failure of any party to this Agreement to perform a
covenant  or agreement contained in this Agreement or (2) a knowing or
willful breach  by  any party hereto of any representation or warranty
contained herein made as  of  the date of this Agreement, such party shall
be fully liable for any and all  Damages incurred or suffered by any other
party as a result of such failure  or  breach. The provisions of Section
6.01 (it being understood that all  provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will remain in full force and  effect), Section 12.02 and Article
13 shall survive any termination hereof  pursuant to Section 12.01.

this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against  whom the

be held in London,  England pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration (the " **ICC

accordance with the  then-prevailing ICC Rules. The parties agree that the

specific  performance, in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled  at  law or in equity. Each  of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of the ICC and  irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that  it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue in London, England  is an  inconvenient
forum. Each party shall bear its own expenses incurred  in connection with
arbitration and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators  shall be shared
equally by the parties involved in the dispute and advanced  by  them from
time to time as required. The decision of the arbitrators  in any such
proceeding will be final and binding and not subject to judicial  review and
final judgment may be entered upon such an award in any court of  competent
jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment will not be required to  make  such
award effective. Any action against any party hereto ancillary  to
arbitration pursuant to this Section 13.06 (as determined by the 
arbitrators), including any action for provisional or conservatory measures 
or  action to enforce an arbitration award or any judgment entered by any
court  in  respect of any thereof may be brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction  located within London, England, in the United States District
Court for  the Southern District of New York or any New York State court
sitting in New  York City, Borough of Manhattan or in any other court in any
jurisdiction in  the  world, and the parties hereto  hereby irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. The  parties hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  law, any objection
which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue  of any such
action brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum  for the
maintenance of such action. Each of the parties hereto agrees  that a
judgment in any such action may be enforced in other jurisdictions by  suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Process  in any such
suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere  in  the
world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such  court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service  of process on such
party as provided in Section 13.06 shall be deemed  effective service of
process on such party.

 

 

Section  13.07 _. Counterparts; Third Party  Beneficiaries_ _. _This
Agreement may be signed in any  number of counterparts, each of which shall
be an original, with the same effect  as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same  instrument. Each Transaction Document shall become
effective when  each party thereto shall have received a counterpart thereof
signed by the  other  party thereto. No Transaction Document is intended to
confer upon any  Person other than the parties thereto any rights or
remedies  hereunder.

 

 

Section  13.08 _. Entire Agreement_ _. _The Transaction  Documents, together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire  agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this  Agreement and

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall  in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal  substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner 
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the  parties

that (1) the  Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement may include certain items
and information  solely for informational purposes for the convenience of
Buyer and (2) the  disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule shall not be  deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that
the matter is required  to  be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is  material. If any section of the Disclosure Schedule
discloses an item  or information in such a way as to make its relevance to
the disclosure required  by another section of the Disclosure Schedule
reasonably apparent, the matter  shall be deemed to have been disclosed in
such other section of the Disclosure  Schedule, notwithstanding the omission
of an appropriate cross-reference to  such  other section of the Disclosure
Schedule. The parties further  acknowledge and agree that neither the
specification in any provision of this  Agreement nor the inclusion in any
section of the Disclosure Schedule of any  dollar amount or any item or
matter is intended to imply or shall be deemed  to  constitute an
acknowledgment by Seller that such amount (or higher or lower  amount) or
such item or matter (or other items or matters) are or are not (x)  material
or rise to the level of any materiality or Material Adverse Effect  standard
for purposes of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, (y) in  the 
ordinary course of business of the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiary or 
(z)  required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement. No party 
shall use the fact of any such specification or inclusion (or lack thereof) 
in  any dispute or controversy among the parties as to the foregoing 
matters. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule but not  defined
therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this  Agreement.
