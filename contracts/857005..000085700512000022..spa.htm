STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

  

This Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended, restated or supplemented from time
to time, this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of August 7, 2012 (the
"Agreement Date") by and among Parametric Technology Corporation, a
Massachusetts corporation ("Buyer"), Servigistics, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), the stockholders of the Company listed on
Schedule 2.6(a)(i) (each, a "Seller" and collectively, the "Sellers"), and
Servigistics, LLC as the seller representative (together with its permitted
successors, the "Seller Representative").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, the Sellers together are, and as of Closing they will be, the record
and beneficial owners of all of the outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock (the "Shares") and desire to sell to Buyer all of the Shares, and Buyer
desires to purchase all of the Shares from the Sellers, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  


 

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE

  

  

1.1. Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and in consideration of the Purchase Price, at the Closing each Seller
shall sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver his, her or its Shares to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from each Seller, and take delivery from each
Seller of, such Seller's Shares, free and clear of all Liens.

  

  

1.2. Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section
8.1, the consummation (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Shares
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements (collectively, the "Transactions") will take place as promptly as
practicable, but no later than three (3) Business Days, immediately following
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) (the "Satisfaction"
and the date on which the Satisfaction occurs, the "Satisfaction Date"), at
the offices of Bingham McCutchen LLP, One Federal Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, unless another place or date is agreed to by Buyer and the
Seller Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence the Closing would occur during the period
beginning on the day that is fifteen (15) days prior to the end of Buyer's
2012 fiscal year and ending on the last day of such fiscal year, then the
Closing may instead at Buyer's election take place on the Business Day
immediately following the last day of such fiscal year or on such other date
as Buyer and the Seller Representative may agree, subject nonetheless to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (such
Closing, is also herein referred to as a "Blackout Closing"). The date upon
which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date."

  

  

1.3. Purchase Price; Payment; Escrow; Allocation Certificate; Withholding.

  

  

(a) Final Purchase Price. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Buyer to
the Sellers for the Shares (the "Final Purchase Price") shall be an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to: (i) $220,000,000 (the "Gross Purchase
Price"), (ii) minus (without duplication): (A) the aggregate 
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

Acquisition Expenses, (B) the aggregate Indebtedness, excluding any Permitted
Indebtedness, of the Company and the Subsidiaries reflected on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, (C) the aggregate amount of all Change in Control
Payments, (D) the aggregate amount of all Historic Severance Payments, (E) the
Pro-Rata Bonus Amount, (F) the aggregate amount of all Marlin Payments, and
(G) the aggregate amount of the Canadian Consumption Tax in the case of

the Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(i) The "Working Capital Adjustment" will be an amount (expressed as either a
positive or negative) equal to the following:

  

  

(A) if the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital Amount, then the Working Capital Adjustment will be a positive number
equal to the excess of the Closing Net Working Capital over the Target Net
Working Capital Amount;

  

  

(B) if the Closing Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net Working
Capital Amount, then the Working Capital Adjustment will be zero; and

  

  

(C) if the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working
Capital Amount, then the Working Capital Adjustment will be a negative number
equal to the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital and the Target
Net Working Capital Amount.

  

  

(ii) The Purchase Price shall be paid as set forth in Section 1.3(b).

  

  

(b) Payment of Estimated Purchase Price.

  

  

(i) The Estimated Purchase Price, as calculated at Closing, shall be an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to (i) the Gross Purchase Price, (ii) minus
(without duplication): (A) the aggregate Acquisition Expenses, (B) the
aggregate Indebtedness, excluding any Permitted Indebtedness, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, (C) the
aggregate amount of all Change in Control Payments, (D) the aggregate amount
of all Historic Severance Payments, (E) the Pro-Rata Bonus Amount, (F) the
aggregate amount of all Marlin Payments, and (G) the aggregate amount of the
Canadian Consumption Tax in the case of clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F)
and (G) to the extent not paid as of immediately prior to the Closing, (iii)
plus the Estimated Closing Cash, and (iv) plus the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment (the "Estimated Purchase Price"). The Estimated Purchase Price is
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 1.3(b) and
Section 1.6.

  

  

(ii) The "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment" will be an amount (expressed
as either a positive or negative) equal to the following:

  

  

(A) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target
Net Working Capital Amount, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment will
be a positive number equal to the excess of the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital over the Target Net Working Capital Amount;

  

  

(B) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net
Working Capital Amount, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment will be
zero; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

(C) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital Amount, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment will be
a negative number equal to the difference between the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital and the Target Net Working Capital Amount.

  

  

(iii) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, subject to each Seller delivering to Buyer the certificate(s)
representing such Seller's Shares duly and properly endorsed for transfer,
Buyer shall pay to each Seller with respect to such Seller's Shares, net of
such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount and subject to reduction
pursuant to Section 1.3(e), an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the
aggregate of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
Seller multiplied by the Estimated Per Common Share Payment Amount, plus (ii)
the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such Seller
multiplied by the Series A Liquidation Preference, plus (iii) the number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock owned by such Seller multiplied by the
Estimated Per Series B Share Payment Amount as set forth on the Allocation
Certificate. Each such payment shall be made by wire transfer of federal funds
to an account designated by such Seller as set forth on the Allocation
Certificate.

  

  

(c) Escrow. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit with U.S. Bank National
Association (the "Escrow Agent") a portion of the Purchase Price equal to
$22,000,000 in cash (together with any interest and other income earned
thereon, the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall be held in trust by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in the
form of Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement") and shall be released in accordance
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto agree that any payment of the
Escrow Amount to the Sellers shall constitute part of the Purchase Price and
is intended to qualify for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the
Code.

  

  

(d) Allocation Certificate. At least four (4) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (the
"Allocation Certificate") of the Company signed by the Chief Executive Officer

Closing, including a separate listing of the aggregate amount of Permitted
Indebtedness, together with a list of each payee and the amount of each
element thereof;

all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the Escrow Agent or

At the Closing, Buyer shall repay the Indebtedness, excluding any Permitted
Indebtedness, as set forth on the Allocation Certificate and the payoff

(b) Other Payments. Buyer shall, in each case to the extent not paid as of
immediately prior to the Closing, (i) at the Closing, pay any Acquisition
Expenses to each payee entitled to payment therefor; (ii) at the Closing, pay
to the Company the amount of the Change in Control Payments, which Change in

amount of the Historic Severance Payments, which Historic Severance Payments
shall be paid by the Company to the recipients thereof as soon as reasonably
practicable; and (iv) at the Closing, pay the Marlin Payments to the Marlin
Entities.

  

  

1.5. Post-Closing Adjustment Procedure.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) calendar days
after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Seller
Representative a statement (the "Closing Financial Statement"), setting forth
calculations of (i) Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing
Net Working Capital") and (ii) the Closing Cash. The Closing Financial
Statement will be prepared in good faith in accordance with the Accounting
Procedures, and which shall be in substantially the form of the Sample Net
Working Capital Statement.

  

  

(b) Each party will provide the other party and its representatives with
reasonable access to books and records and relevant personnel during the
preparation of the Closing Financial Statement and the resolution of any
disputes that may arise under this Section 1.5. Buyer shall give the Seller
Representative timely access upon request to all reasonably necessary
supporting workpapers used in the preparation of the Closing Financial
Statement.

  

  

(c) If the Seller Representative disagrees with the determination of the
Closing Net Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash as shown on the Closing
Financial Statement, the Seller Representative will notify Buyer in writing of
such disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the
Closing Financial Statement to the Seller Representative, which notice will
describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail to the
extent practicable and identify the specific items involved and the dollar
amount of each such disagreement, and provide reasonable supporting
documentation to the extent practicable for each such disagreement. If the
Seller Representative fails to deliver such a notice of disagreement within
this thirty (30) calendar day period, then the determination of 
  
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Cash as shown on the Closing
Financial Statement will be final and binding.

  

  

(d) If the Seller Representative delivers such a notice of disagreement within
the thirty (30) calendar day period following receipt of the Closing Financial
Statement, Buyer and the Seller Representative agree to negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such disagreement. If Buyer and the Seller Representative
are unable to resolve all disagreements raised by the Seller Representative
pursuant to Section 1.5(c) within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery to
Buyer of written notice of such disagreement, then Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall execute a memorandum (the "Working Capital Memorandum")
setting forth (i) the resolved items and/or amounts, if any, and (ii) the
items or amounts that remain in dispute following such good faith negotiations
and, such disagreements will be submitted for final and binding resolution to
the Chicago office of Ernst and Young LLP (the "Accounting Arbitrator"). The
Accounting Arbitrator will deliver to Buyer and the Seller Representative, as
promptly as practicable and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days
after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any
such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
which, as to each amount in disagreement, will be an amount no less than the
lesser of the amounts claimed by either Buyer or Sellers, and no greater than
the greater of the amounts claimed by either Buyer or Sellers. The
determinations of the Accounting Arbitrator will be final and binding. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in connection with its
determination of the disputed items will be paid jointly, one-half by Buyer
and one-half by Sellers; provided, that if the difference between the
Accounting Arbitrator's determination of the disputed items and the
determination of the disputed items that would have resulted from the use of
the proposed calculations of Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller
Representative on the other hand (the "Erroneous Party") is more than twice as
great as the difference between the Accounting Arbitrator's determination of
the disputed items and the determination of the disputed items that would have
resulted from the use of the other party's proposed calculations, the
Erroneous Party will pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator. Other than such fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator,
Buyer and Sellers will each be responsible for their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 1.5.

  

  

(e) The final determination of Closing Cash and Closing Net Working Capital
pursuant to Section 1.5(c) and (d), if applicable, shall be used in the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(a).

  

  

1.6. Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.3(a) is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer will submit a claim
certificate to the Escrow Agent, which shall not be subject to dispute, for an
amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and the
Final Purchase Price and shall be entitled to receive payment from the Escrow
Account of the amount of such difference as soon as practicable following the
submission of such claim certificate.

  

  

(b) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.3(a) is
the same as the Estimated Purchase Price, there will be no further adjustment
made to the Purchase Price.

  

  

(c) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.3(a) is
greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then on the third (3rd) Business
Day following determination of the Final Purchase Price, Buyer will pay to
each Seller an amount in cash equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the
difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

1.7. Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 1.6
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed on Schedule
2.1(a), which constitute all of the jurisdictions in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership, leasing, holding or use of its properties makes

be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made

Organizational Documents, each as amended as of the Agreement Date and in full

delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related Agreements by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been, and each of the Related Agreements to which the Company is
a party will be at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto (other than the Company), this Agreement constitutes, and
in the case of the Related Agreements they will at Closing constitute, valid,
legal and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or law).

party, and the consummation of the Transactions, do not and will not (a)
conflict with or result in any material violation of or material default under
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any material
obligation or loss of any material benefit under, or result in the imposition
or creation of any Lien upon the Shares or any material Lien upon any of the

limitation, modification or alteration (including payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would otherwise be

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of periodic financial statements
and to maintain accountability for assets, and (ii) in a timely manner
accumulate and communicate to the Company's principal executive officer and

accountant or representative of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the inadequacy of such
systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of the Company Financial
Statements. To the Company's Knowledge, there have been no instances of fraud
by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, whether or not material, that
occurred during any period covered by the Company Financial Statements.

Act).

2.10. Accounts Receivable; Bank Accounts.

  

  

(a) Schedule 2.10(a)(i) lists all accounts receivable of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date. All of the accounts receivable of
the Company and the Subsidiaries (a) represent bona fide transactions that
arose in the ordinary course of business, (b) to the Company's Knowledge are
subject to no setoffs or counterclaims and (c) to the Company's Knowledge are
collectible.

  

  

(b) No Person has any Lien on any account receivable, and no written request
or agreement for material deduction or material discount has been made with
respect to any account receivable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Set forth on Schedule 2.10(c) is a description of each account maintained
by or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries at any bank or
other financial institution including the authorized signatories of each
account except for any changes made prior to the Closing Date in compliance
with Section 5.1. There are no outstanding powers of attorney executed on
behalf of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

  

  

2.11. Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no judgment, injunction,
order, decree or material agreement (excluding material agreements granting
customers ownership or title to Intellectual Property Rights developed
pursuant to a services engagement for such customer) to which the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries is a party, subject or otherwise bound, that would
reasonably be expected to prohibit, impair or otherwise limit: (a) any
material business practice of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates; (b) any acquisition of property (tangible or
intangible) by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates; (c) the conduct of any material business by the Company, any of
the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates; or (d) the freedom of
the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates to
engage in any line of business or to compete or do business with any Person,
in each case whether arising as a result of a change in control of the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or
otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has (x) entered into any agreement under
which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates is restricted from selling, licensing, manufacturing or otherwise
distributing any of its technology or products or from providing services to
customers or potential customers or any class of customers, in any geographic
area, during any period of time, or in any segment of the market (but
excluding provisions in customer agreements granting customers ownership or
title to Intellectual Property Rights developed pursuant to a services
engagement for such customer), or (y) granted any Person exclusive rights to
sell, license, manufacture or otherwise distribute any of the Company's, any
of the Subsidiaries' or any of their respective Affiliates' technology or
products in any geographic area or with respect to any customers or potential
customers or any class of customers during any period of time or in any
segment of the market. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement that violates any Antitrust Law.

  

  

2.12. Real Property; Leases.

  

  

(a) None of the real property currently used or occupied by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries, in each case together with all build-out, fixtures and
improvements created thereon ("Company Real Property"), is owned by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, nor has the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries ever owned any real property. All of the Company Real Property is
leased or subleased by the Company or one of the Subsidiaries pursuant to a
Lease set forth on Schedule 2.12(b). Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has any contractual obligation to purchase any land or buildings.

  

  

(b) Schedule 2.12(b) sets forth all leases, subleases, financing agreements
and other agreements, in each case, pursuant to which the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries derives its rights in the Company Real Property (the
"Leases"), including, with respect to each such Lease, the identity of the
landlord or sublandlord, the addresses, the date of such Lease and each
amendment thereto.

  

  

(c) The Leases are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or law). There does not exist under
any such Lease any material default by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
or, to the Company's Knowledge, by any other Person, or any event 
  
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or, to the
Company's Knowledge, by any other Person. No notice or agreement to terminate
any Lease has been served on the Company or any Subsidiary, or entered into by
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect thereto. The Company has made
available to Buyer complete copies of all Leases, including all amendments and
agreements related thereto, and the Leases constitute the entire agreement
between the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and each landlord or
sublandlord with respect to the Company Real Property. All scheduled rent and
other material charges currently due and payable under the Leases have been
paid, except for liabilities reflected or reserved against in the Company
Balance Sheet. There are no matters or restrictions affecting the Company Real
Property or the Leases that would reasonably be expected to interfere to any
material extent with the continued use and occupancy by the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company Real Property for the Company's business.

  

  

(d) The Company or one of the Subsidiaries is the holder of the tenant's
interest under the Leases and has not assigned the Leases or subleased all or
any portion of the premises leased thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries has made any material alterations, additions or improvements
to the premises leased under the Leases that are required to be removed at the
termination of the applicable Lease term and the cost of which restoration
would be reasonably likely to exceed $50,000 per Lease or $150,000 in the
aggregate.

  

  

2.13. Assets; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances.

  

  

(a) Schedule 2.13(a) sets forth as of the Agreement Date all equipment,
materials, tangible prototypes, tools, supplies, vehicles, furniture,
fixtures, improvements and other tangible assets, excluding the Company Real
Property and any alterations or improvements thereon (the "Tangible Assets")
of the Company and the Subsidiaries with an individual book value of greater
than $10,000, and sets forth the original cost and book value of each such
asset. The Tangible Assets of the Company are adequate and sufficient, in all
material respects, for the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be
conducted.

  

  

(b) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or,
in the case of Company Real Property and leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets,
real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear
of any Liens, except as reflected in the Company Balance Sheet and except for
Permitted Liens.

  

  

(c) All facilities, machinery, equipment, fixtures, vehicles, and other
personal properties owned, leased or used by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (i) are adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted in all material respects and (ii)
are in good operating condition, subject to normal wear and tear, and
reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for which they are being used and
not in need of replacement.

  

  

2.14. Proprietary Rights.

  

  

(a) Schedule 2.14(a) lists all Company Registered Intellectual Property.
Schedule 2.14(a) lists any proceedings or actions before any court, tribunal
(including the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") or equivalent
authority anywhere in the world) related to any of the Company Registered
Intellectual Property. All Company Registered Intellectual Property is
subsisting or pending and, to the Company's Knowledge, in compliance with all
formal legal requirements (including payment of filing, examination and
maintenance fees and proofs of use). All necessary documents and certificates
in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual Property have been
filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in
the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case 
  
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

may be, for the purposes of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual
Property. There are no actions that must be taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Agreement Date,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to PTO or foreign, as the case may be, office actions,
documents, applications or certificates for the purpose of obtaining,
maintaining, perfecting or preserving or renewing such Company Registered
Intellectual Property. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would render any Company Registered Intellectual Property
invalid or unenforceable.

  

  

(b) Schedule 2.14(b) sets forth a true, accurate and complete list of all
licenses, sublicenses, and royalty, escrow, maintenance, support and other
agreements to which the Company and/or any Subsidiary is a party and pursuant
to which (i) the Company or any Subsidiary is authorized to use, license the
use of, distribute or exercise any other rights with respect to any third
party Proprietary Rights that are incorporated in or used by, any of the
Company Products or services (collectively, the "Company In-Licenses"), or
(ii) any other person is authorized to use, license the use of, distribute or
exercise any other rights with respect to any Company-Owned Intellectual
Property, including but not limited to any such licenses granted by the
Company or any Subsidiary to any other person to modify, distribute, integrate
or bundle any of the Company Software Products or Software developed or
licensed exclusively by the Company (collectively, the "Company Out-
Licenses"); provided, however, that (x) any generally available, off-the-shelf
software programs licensed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries on
standard terms need not be listed in Schedule 2.14(b)(i), (y) customer
agreements that do not grant rights with respect to source code for Company
Products, reseller and distribution contracts granting or authorizing the
granting of only a non-exclusive, internal-use, end-user license to object
code, and any associated support agreements, need not be listed in Schedule
2.14(b)(ii), and (z) non-disclosure agreements that do not grant
commercialization rights, and are entered into in the ordinary course of
business, need not be listed in Schedule 2.14(b)(i) or Schedule 2.14(b)(ii).
Schedule 2.14(b)(ii) also accurately and completely identifies any Company
Out-Licenses which are exclusive in a territory.

  

  

(c) The Company, or its Subsidiaries, owns, possesses a valid license to use
(as currently used by the Company or its Subsidiaries), or otherwise has the
full legal right to use (as currently used by the Company or its Subsidiaries)
all of the Company Intellectual Property, free and clear, in the case of
Company-Owned Intellectual Property, of any Lien (whether arising by contract
or by operation of law), except as reflected in the Company Balance Sheet and
except for Permitted Liens. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns,
possesses or otherwise has the right to use all Company Intellectual Property
and all other Proprietary Rights necessary or required for the conduct of the
business of the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, as currently
conducted, including the development, marketing and distribution of the
existing products of the Company and each Subsidiary as currently developed,
marketed and distributed. Except for the Company Out-Licenses, and the subject
matter excluded from the disclosure obligation of Schedule 2.14(b)(ii), there
are no outstanding rights or options (whether or not currently exercisable),
licenses or agreements of any kind (including, without limitation, any
agreement for joint development and/or joint ownership of Intellectual
Property Rights) granted by the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to the
Company-Owned Intellectual Property. Except under the Company In-Licenses and
the other agreements excluded from the disclosure obligation of Schedule
2.14(b)(i), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is obligated to pay any
royalties or other compensation (other than market rate fees for standard
Software licenses that are generally commercially available), to any third
party (including, without limitation, any current or former Employees,
consultants or independent contractors) in respect of its ownership, use or
license of any Company Intellectual Property. There has been no material
breach or violation by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company In-
Licenses set forth or required to be set forth on Schedule 2.14(b)(i), and to
the Company's Knowledge, there is no material breach or violation by any other
party to, any such Company In-License.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, as the result
of the operation of any agreements to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is
a party, impair the rights of Buyer or the Company to use, practice, operate
under, license, sublicense, dispose of, or bring suit for infringement of any
of the Company-Owned Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights
licensed to the Company pursuant to the Company In-Licenses to the same extent
that the Company and each Subsidiary would have been able to had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments that the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise be
required to pay.

  

  

(e) Neither the business of the Company nor any Subsidiary, as currently
conducted, nor any of the services, products or support delivered by the
Company or any Subsidiary to its customers, as currently delivered, infringes,
constitutes the misappropriation of, or conflicts with, any Proprietary Rights
of any third party (including without limitation due to the use of any Third
Party Software without a valid license or without complying with the
restrictions and terms of a valid license). None of Company's nor any
Subsidiary's use of third party products or services, as currently used,
infringes, constitutes the misappropriation of, or conflicts with, any
Proprietary Rights of any third party (including without limitation due to the
use of any Third Party Software without a valid license or without complying
with the restrictions and terms of a valid license) or constitute unfair
competition or trade practice under the laws of any jurisdiction. To the
Company's Knowledge there is no claim, and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has ever received any written (or, to the Company's Knowledge,
oral) notice or other communication of any claim from, any Person asserting
that the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, as currently conducted and
as currently contemplated to be conducted, or any of the services, products or
support delivered by the Company or any Subsidiary to its customers, or any
use by the Company or any Subsidiary of any third party products or services,
infringe or may infringe, constitute the misappropriation of, or conflict
with, any Proprietary Rights of another Person or constitute unfair
competition or trade practice under the laws of any jurisdiction. To the
Company's Knowledge, there are no existing or threatened infringement,
misappropriation, unfair competition or trade practice or competing claims by
any third party regarding the ownership of or right to use any Company-Owned
Intellectual Property. To the Company's Knowledge, without having conducted
any customer audits, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or violating
any Proprietary Rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or engaging
in unfair competition or trade practices with respect to the Company.

  

  

(f) Schedule 2.14(f) lists any Software that (i) has been incorporated or
embedded into, or distributed with, any of the Company Software Products and
(ii) was not developed by Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in the
course of their employment for the Company or any Subsidiary. Except for those
individuals set forth on Schedule 2.14(f) whose assignment agreements have
been provided to the Buyer, no consultants, contractors, or other third
parties (other than Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in the course
of their employment) have contributed to, or participated in any respect in
the development of, the Company-Owned Intellectual Property.

  

  

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective consultants, and
agents) have not incorporated, bundled, or distributed any Open Source
Software into or with any of the Company Software Products in such a manner as
to cause or require, under the terms of the applicable open source license
agreement for such Open Source Software, (A) all or any portion of such
Company Software Product (other than original Open Source Software) to be
treated as Open Source Software under the terms of such open source license or
(B) all or any portion of the source code of such Company Software Product
(other than the original Open Source Software) to be distributed or provided
to licensees in connection with the licensing or distribution of such Company
Software Product. In particular, (i) none of the Company Software Products
contain any Open Source Software that would cause any portion of the Company
Software Products to be disclosed or subject to disclosure under the 
 

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

  terms of the GPL and any past obligations for disclosure of any portion of
the Company Software Products under the GPL have been released and are no
longer in effect with respect to any of the current Company Software Products;
and (ii) any Company Software Products containing any Software subject to the
LGPL fit within the exception set forth in Section 4 of the LGPL and as such
no Company Software Products are subject to disclosure under the terms of the
LGPL. "Open Source Software" means any software that is distributed as free
software, open source software (e.g., Linux) or similar licensing or
distribution models, including, without limitation, software licensed or
distributed under any of the following licenses, or licenses similar to any of
the following: (i) GNU's General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL
(LGPL); (ii) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL); (iii) the Mozilla Public
License; (iv) the Netscape Public License; (v) the Sun Community Source
License (SCSL); or (vi) the Sun Industry Standards License (SISL). Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has incorporated in, or included with, any of the
Company Software Products, or otherwise delivered to any second or subsequent
customers, any Software or any derivative of any Software (A) which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries created and/or delivered to an initial or
earlier customer in the course of performing consulting, implementation,
maintenance or other services for such initial or earlier customer and (B) in
which such initial or earlier customer has any ownership or other similar
rights other than a nonexclusive license from the Company or a Subsidiary
(regardless whether such rights were assigned to or vested in such customer).

 

  

  

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures
reasonably designed to establish and preserve the ownership of or exclusive
rights to the Company-Owned Intellectual Property or Company Software
Products, including the protection of Trade Secrets. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, all Employees, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company or any Subsidiary who are or were involved in, or
who have contributed to, the creation or development of any material Company-
Owned Intellectual Property, Company Software Products and all Employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary who have otherwise had access to material Trade
Secrets of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary have executed and
delivered to the Company or any Subsidiary legally binding confidentiality and
assignment of inventions agreements, which effectively assign the ownership of
and protect the confidentiality of such Company-Owned Intellectual Property,
Company Software Products and Trade Secrets to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. Copies of such agreements with current Employees
have been made available to Buyer, and all of such agreements with current
Employees are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is aware of any material violation of the confidentiality of any Trade Secrets
comprising Company-Owned Intellectual Property or Company Software Products.
None of the Company, any Subsidiary or, to the Company's Knowledge, the
Employees, consultants, or independent contractors of the Company or any
Subsidiary have any agreements or arrangements with any former employers
relating to Trade Secrets of such employers that would interfere with the
activities of the Company or any Subsidiary. To the Company's Knowledge, the
activities of the Employees, consultants, or independent contractors of the
Company or any Subsidiary on behalf of the business of the Company or any
Subsidiary as currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be
conducted do not violate any agreements or arrangements which such Employees
have with former employers or any other third person. To the Company's
Knowledge, no current or former Employee, stockholder, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary has any right, claim
or interest in or with respect to any of the Company-Owned Intellectual

used in connection with, the operation of the business of the Company or any

conformity in all material respects with the specifications for such Company
Product, all applicable contractual commitments and all applicable express and
implied warranties, except for non-conformities for which an adequate reserve
has been made on the Company Balance Sheet. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation (and to the Company's
Knowledge, there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand against
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries giving rise to any liability or
obligation) for replacement or repair of any Company Product or other damages

Company Balance Sheet. There is no claim pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries relating
to any Services or services agreement and, to the Company's Knowledge, there
is no reasonable basis for the assertion of any such claim. Schedule

Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with and have not
breached, violated or defaulted under in any material respect, or received
written notice that they have breached, violated or defaulted under, in any
material respect, any of the terms or conditions of any Disclosable Contract,

2.25. Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Schedule. Schedule 2.25(a) sets forth each Company Employee Plan. Neither
the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any stated plan, intention or
commitment to establish any new Company Employee Plan, to modify or terminate
any Company Employee Plan (except to the extent required by Law or to conform
any such Company Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

  Law, in each case as previously disclosed to Buyer in writing, or as
required by this Agreement), or to enter into any Company Employee Plan.

correct and complete copies of each Company Employee Plan or related trust,

Plan; (iii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Series 5500 and all

having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the Subsidiaries relating to

(including specifically any correspondence regarding actual or potential
audits or investigations) to or from the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan, (vii) all material written
agreements and contracts relating to each Company Employee Plan, including
fidelity or ERISA bonds, administrative service agreements, group annuity

any Employee or Employees relating to any Company Employee Plan and any
proposed Company Employee Plans, in each case relating to any amendments,

of payments or vesting schedules or other events that would result in any
material liability to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and that are not
reflected in the current summary plan description and plan document; (ix) all
material forms and notices relating to the provision of post-employment

(c) Employee Plan Compliance. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has
performed all material obligations required to be performed by it under each
Company Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and
maintained in accordance with its terms and in all material respects in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each
Company Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and
each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS with respect to
such Company Employee Plan as to its qualified status under the Code, and
nothing has occurred as to any such Company Employee Plan which has resulted
or is likely to result in the revocation of such qualification or which
requires or could reasonably be expected to require action under the
compliance resolution programs of the IRS to preserve such qualification. No
Company Employee Plan and no party in interest with respect thereto has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction," which could subject the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to liability under Section 4975 of
the Code or Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA. There are no actions, suits,
claims or proceedings pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened
(other than routine claims for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan or
fiduciary thereto or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan nor, to
the Company's Knowledge, is there any reasonable basis therefor. No
communication, report or disclosure has been made which, at the time of
disclosure, did not accurately reflect the terms and operation of the relevant
Company Employee Plan. The Company has not undertaken to maintain any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

  Company Employee Plan for any period of time and each Employee Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued on or after the Closing Date in
accordance with its terms, without liability to the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary
administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event). There are
no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Company's Knowledge,
threatened by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any
Company Employee Plan. All annual reports and other filings required by the
IRS, DOL or any other similar Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries have been timely made. Neither the Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty
or Tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 501(i) of ERISA
or Section 4975 through 4980D of the Code or any similar Laws of other
jurisdictions applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and no
Company Employee Plan is sponsored or maintained by any Person that is or was
considered to be a co-employer with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

 

  

  

(d) Plan Status. None of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate now, or has ever, maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in or contributed to any plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code. None of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred, nor do they reasonably expect to incur, any liability
with respect to any transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA. No Company
Employee Plan is a multiple employer plan as defined in Section 210 of ERISA
or any similar concept under any other applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Multiemployer Plans. At no time has the Company, any of the Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate contributed to or been requested to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any similar
concept under any other applicable Law.

  

  

(f) No Post-Employment Obligations. No Company Employee Plan provides, or has
any liability to provide, life insurance, medical or other employee welfare
benefits to any Employee upon or after his or her retirement or termination of
employment for any reason, except as may be required by Law, and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has ever represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either individually or to
Employees as a group) that such Employee(s) would be provided with life
insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits upon or after their
retirement or termination of employment, except to the extent required by Law.

  

  

(g) Funding of Plans. With respect to each Company Employee Plan for which a
separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full and timely
payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, under the terms of each such Company Employee Plan or applicable
Law, as applied through the Closing Date. The current value of the assets of
each such Company Employee Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan
year of that Company Employee Plan, equals or exceeds the current value of all
benefits liabilities under that Company Employee Plan.

  

  

(h) Effect of Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which the Company is a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions, will not conflict with or
result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under
any Company Employee Plan, trust or loan that would reasonably be expected to
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) Foreign Jurisdictions. Each Company Employee Plan subject to the Laws of
any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) if intended to qualify for
special Tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment, (ii) is
fully funded and has been fully accrued for on the Company Financial
Statements and (iii) if required to be registered, has been registered with
the appropriate Governmental Entities and has been maintained in good standing
with the appropriate Governmental Entities.

  

  

(j) Taxation. Each Company Employee Plan has been properly classified with
respect to the payment of Taxes, including in particular social security
payments and contributions, and any exemptions have been properly applied and
all filings have been completed accurately and in a timely manner with the
appropriate Tax Authorities.

  

  

(k) Discretion. Each Company Employee Plan that is deemed to be discretionary
can be suspended or interrupted at any time at the Company's or the relevant
Subsidiary's discretion, and has not created any rights or obligations, either
from past practice or restrictions under the Employment Agreements or
otherwise, that would in any way limit the right of the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary to prospectively vary, suspend, reduce, amend, terminate
or otherwise change any current or future payments under any such
discretionary Company Employee Plan.

the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not conflict with or
result in any material violation of or material default under (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of termination,

such disclosure and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give the
other an opportunity (as is reasonable under the circumstances) to comment on
such disclosure.

  

  

5.5. Consents.

  

  

(a) The Company and the Sellers, at their own expense, shall promptly apply
for or otherwise seek and use their reasonable efforts to promptly obtain the
consents listed in Schedule 5.5(a), and their commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly obtain all other consents, waivers, and approvals required to be
obtained by them in connection with the Transactions, including all consents,
waivers, and approvals under any of the agreements to which any Seller, the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which they or their
properties or assets are bound in order to preserve the benefits thereunder
for the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the lessor
or licensor under any Lease conditions its grant of a consent (including by
threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or
otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent request made in
connection with this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing"
payment or other consideration (including increased rent payments), or the
provision of additional security (including a guaranty), Buyer shall be solely
responsible for making all such payments or providing all such additional
security, and the amount of such payments or additional security shall be
treated as an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

  Acquisition Expense. None of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Sellers
shall agree to the provision of any of the foregoing, whether by amendment to

5.6. Antitrust Filings.

required under the HSR Act and all other filings and notifications that Buyer
deems necessary or desirable in connection with the Transactions under other
applicable Antitrust Laws (collectively, the "Antitrust Filings") with the
appropriate Governmental Entity designated by Law to receive such filings.
Each party shall pay any filing fees for which it is responsible in connection
with the Antitrust Filings, except that, Buyer shall be solely responsible for
the payment of any filing fees in connection with the filing of any
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act.

  

  

(b) As promptly as is practicable after receiving any request from any
appropriate Governmental Entity for information, documents, or other materials
in connection with the review of the Antitrust Filings, Buyer, the Company and
each Seller, as the case may be, shall use his, her or its commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with such request and, to the extent practicable
and permitted by applicable Law, permit the other parties' legal counsel (in
the case of the Sellers, the Seller Representative's counsel) to review in
advance any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity to the
extent that such review will not result in the waiver of any applicable
privilege and subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements. Buyer, the
Company and each Seller shall each cooperate reasonably with the others in
connection with resolving any inquiry or investigation by any Governmental
Entity relating to the Antitrust Filings. Buyer, the Company and each Seller
shall each promptly inform the others (in the case of informing the Sellers,
by informing the Seller Representative) of any communication with, and any
proposed understanding, agreement, or undertaking with any Governmental Entity
relating to its Antitrust Filing. Buyer, the Company and each Seller shall
each give the other reasonable advance notice of, and the opportunity to
participate in (directly or through its representatives, and in the case of
the Sellers only by or through the Seller Representative) any inquiry or
investigation by, or any material meeting or conference (whether by
telecommunications or in person) with, any Governmental Entity relating to the
Antitrust Filings if, in the reasonable judgment of the party that is subject
to the inquiry, investigation, meeting or conference, such participation by
the other party is prudent and (based upon the advice of legal counsel)
legally permissible. Each of Buyer, the Company and each Seller agrees to use
his, her or its commercially reasonable efforts to secure termination or
expiration of any waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws and/or
to obtain the approval of any antitrust Governmental Entity, as applicable,
for the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
Section 5.6(b) the Seller Representative shall take all actions on behalf of
each Seller, and shall give and receive all notices on behalf of each Seller,
except to the extent not permissible under applicable Law.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall
require or be construed to require Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in order to
obtain the consent or successful termination or expiration of any review of
any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions, to (i) sell or hold
separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or to
consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary or by any of their respective Affiliates of any assets or
businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or any change in or
restriction on the operation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any assets
or businesses (including any assets or businesses of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries), (ii) enter into any agreement or be bound by any obligation
that Buyer may deem in its sole discretion to have an

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

  adverse effect on the benefits to Buyer of the Transactions, (iii) modify
any of the terms of this Agreement, or the Transactions, or (iv) initiate or
participate in any legal proceeding with respect to any such matters.

 

  

  

(d) In the event that Buyer is requested, in order to obtain the consent or
successful termination or expiration of any review under any Law regarding the
Transactions, to take any of the actions set forth in Section 5.6(c) or if
such consent, successful termination or expiration has not been obtained
within ninety (90) days following the date of Buyer filing its Antitrust
Filing under any applicable Antitrust Law, Buyer shall have the right to
abandon its efforts to obtain approval under such Antitrust Law of the
Transactions, notwithstanding this Section 5.6. If Buyer so elects to abandon
its efforts to seek such approval, it shall promptly give notice of such
abandonment to the Company.

  

  

5.7. Conditions to the Transactions; Further Assurances. Subject to Sections
5.6(c) and (d), each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) fulfill and cause to be fulfilled the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied by it under this Agreement; (b) comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with
respect to the Transactions and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to any other party hereto in connection with any such requirements
imposed upon such other party in connection with the Transactions; (c) obtain
and make (and will cooperate with the other parties in obtaining or making)
any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any registration,
declaration, or filing with, or an exemption by, any Governmental Entity, or
other third party, required to be obtained or made by such party or its
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action
contemplated by the Related Agreements or by this Agreement; and (d) at the
request of another party hereto, execute and deliver such other instruments
and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Transactions.

(a) The Company and each of the Sellers shall give prompt written notice to
Buyer of: (i) any failure to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; and (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to make any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2 required to be satisfied by it incapable of being satisfied in a
timely manner; and

  

  

(b) Buyer shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any event,
condition, fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to make any

incapable of being satisfied in a timely manner;

  

  

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, no Seller shall sell, pledge, hedge against
or otherwise encumber any of his, her or its Shares or permit any Lien on his,
her or its Shares to exist other than such Liens existing on the date hereof
on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Loan Agreement.

  

  

(c) Until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, except as otherwise prohibited by
applicable Law, if any Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary or any
Representative receives an unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer relating to
a Third-Party Acquisition from any Person, such party shall (i) promptly
notify Buyer of the same and the material details thereof (including the
identity of the Person making same) and such party shall be permitted to
provide a response without breaching this Section 5.10; provided that the
response is limited to informing the initiator of such inquiry, proposal or
offer that such party is unable to respond further at this time, (ii) provide
to Buyer a copy of any written inquiry, proposal or offer and all
correspondence related thereto, and (iii) keep Buyer informed of the status
thereof.

  

  

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 5.10 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties that Buyer shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 5.10 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state or any other jurisdiction having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth above by any Seller, by the Company, by any of the
Subsidiaries

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

  or by any of their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company and such Seller.

 

  

  

5.11. No Post-Closing Solicitation.

  

  

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the two (2)
year anniversary of the later of the Closing Date or the termination of such
Seller's employment (if any) with Buyer, the Company or their respective
Affiliates, each Seller agrees to not, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment any employee or Independent Contractor who as of immediately prior
to the Closing is employed by or provides services to Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, provided, that (i) general advertisements (and any
discussions based upon responses thereto) including, without limitation, any
recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency so long as such Seller
has not directed such recruitment efforts at any such employee or Independent
Contractor or (ii) soliciting any employee or Independent Contractor after
such employee or Independent Contractor has been terminated by the Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be a
breach of the non-solicitation restriction in this provision. The Seller
Representative (either directly or indirectly) shall not be deemed to have
violated this Section 5.11(a) solely by reason of the Seller Representative's
(including any of its investment professionals') or any of its Affiliates'
(including any of their investment professionals) (A) directorship or service
as a board observer on a board of directors of a portfolio company of the
Seller Representative or its Affiliates or (B) vote in approval of the
employment or compensation arrangements of such employee or Independent
Contractor in such person's capacity as a director on a board of directors of
any such portfolio Company, so long as, in the case of both clauses (A) and
(B), the Seller Representative or any of its investment professionals shall
not have, directly or indirectly, proposed or otherwise identified as a
candidate for employment any such employee or Independent Contractor.

  

  

(b) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the two (2)
year anniversary of the later of the Closing Date or the termination of such
Seller's employment (if any) with Buyer, the Company or their respective
Affiliates, each Seller agrees to not, directly or indirectly, on such
Seller\'s own behalf or on behalf of anyone else, (i) induce, encourage or
solicit any present customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, or other business
relation of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease doing or reduce
its business therewith or (ii) in any way interfere with the relationship
between any such customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business
relation of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, but not
limited to, making any negative or disparaging statements or communications
about Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates). The Seller
Representative (either directly or indirectly) shall not be deemed to have
violated this Section 5.11(b) solely by reason of the Seller Representative's
(including any of its investment professionals') or any of its Affiliates'
(including any of their investment professionals') (A) directorship or service
as a board observer on a board of a portfolio company of the Seller
Representative or its Affiliates or (B) vote in approval of the business or
other operating plan of such portfolio company in such person's capacity as a
director on a board of a portfolio company, or (C) any action taken with a
customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of Buyer not
known to the Seller Representative or its Affiliates to be a customer,
supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of Buyer, so long as,
in the case of both clauses (A) and (B), the Seller Representative or any of
its investment professionals shall not have, directly or indirectly, proposed
any such inducement, encouragement and solicitation of, or interference with,
such customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, or other business relation. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Representative's (including any of its
investment professionals') or any of its Affiliates' (including any of their
investment professionals'), directly or indirectly, engaging in a business
competitive with the Company or Buyer shall not violate the provisions of this
Section 5.11(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) If any provision of this Section 5.11 shall for any reason be held invalid
in part, it shall be curtailed, as to time or location or both, only to the
minimum extent required for its validity and enforceability under the
governing law of this Agreement and shall be binding and enforceable with
respect to the Sellers, as so curtailed.

  

  

(d) In the event that any part of this Section 5.11 or the application thereof
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Section 5.11 will continue in
full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons
or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto.

  

  

(e) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section
5.11 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests
of Buyer and its investment in the goodwill of and in the Company and the
Subsidiaries. The restrictive covenants contained in this Section 5.11 are
covenants independent of any other provision of this Agreement or any Related
Agreement between the parties hereunder and the existence of any claim that
any Seller may allege against Buyer under any other provision of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement will not prevent enforcement of these
covenants. Without intending to limit the remedies available to Buyer, each
Seller acknowledges that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this
Section 5.11 will result in material irreparable injury to Buyer for which
there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure
damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or
threat thereof, Buyer shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining
order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without the necessity of
proving irreparable harm or injury as a result of such breach or threatened
breach of this Section 5.11, restraining any Seller from engaging in
activities prohibited by this Section 5.11 or such other relief as may be
required specifically to enforce any of the covenants in this Section 5.11.

  

  

5.12. Section 280G Approval. If the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated to
make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain
circumstances could obligate it to make any payments, that will not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code ("Section 280G Payments") if the
stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not
satisfied, then the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such stockholder approval as promptly as is practicable after the
Agreement Date and in any event prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

5.13. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Conduct of Business. From the Agreement Date until the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall make or change any
material election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any accounting method
in respect of Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle any claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes, file any amended Tax Return, surrender any
refund claim, or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(b) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Transactions shall be borne 50% by the Sellers and 50%
by Buyer (or 50% by the affected Sellers where not all Sellers are liable for
such transfer Tax and 50% by Buyer), and the Sellers will, at their own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation if necessary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Tax Returns. The Company shall (i) prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed when due (taking into account valid extensions) all Tax
Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on
or after the Agreement Date and on or before the Closing Date and shall remit
(or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns and
(ii) provide or make available to Buyer copies of all Tax Returns that are to
be filed by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries after the Agreement Date
and prior to the Closing Date no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
being due (taking into account valid extensions). The Company shall permit
Buyer to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it, and
shall reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to such Tax Returns
as are requested by Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.13,
Buyer shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account valid
extensions) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries for any Tax
period ending after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall remit (or cause to be
remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. In the case of any Tax
Return of the Company or the Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is filed after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) prepare and file
or cause to be prepared and filed when due such Tax Returns, and (ii) submit
such Tax Returns to the Sellers for their review and comment on each such Tax
Return prior to filing it no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to filing
it. Buyer shall provide the Sellers with a reasonable time for such review and
comment, and shall reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to
such Tax Returns as are requested by Sellers. Any Tax Return of the Company or
the Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared
in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law and the past
practices of the Company or relevant Subsidiary. Other than with respect to
Tax Returns for Straddle Periods, three (3) days prior to Buyer filing such
Tax Returns, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer any Tax liabilities which are
shown as due and owing on such Tax Returns.

  

  

(d) Tax Return Amendment. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries) to, amend any previously filed Tax
Return of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period or take any other action that would be reasonably expected to
increase the liability of the Sellers for Taxes (including any liability to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement) without
the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(e) Tax Overpayments. If the Company or any Subsidiary is allowed a refund or
credit of Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period actually paid by the Company or
any Subsidiary (or the Sellers, pursuant to this Agreement) as a result of an
overpayment of Taxes by the Company or any Subsidiary for such Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (i) the Company or any Subsidiary shall claim such overpayment as a
refund (rather than as a credit) to the extent permitted under applicable laws
and (ii) such refund shall be for the account of the Sellers and shall be paid
over to the Sellers, based on their Pro Rata Share, within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such amount; provided, however, any overpayment of Taxes shall be
for the account of Buyer to the extent such overpayment results from a
carryback of losses generated in a taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning after the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by another party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return or computation of
Pre-Closing Taxes or, any inquiry, investigation, claim assessment, audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary (a "Tax Proceeding"). Such cooperation shall include the retention
and, upon Buyer's request, the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such enquiry, investigation, claim assessment,
audit, litigation or other proceeding and access to Employees on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Buyer and the Seller Representative (to the
extent applicable) agree to (i) retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Entity and (ii) use

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

  commercially reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests, Buyer and the Seller Representative, as the case
may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.

 

  

  

(g) Tax Certificates. Buyer and the Seller Representative agree, upon request,
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or customer of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including but not limited to with
respect to the Transactions).

  

  

(h) Tax Contests. Following the Closing, Buyer will have the sole right to
control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Buyer shall
(i) promptly provide the Seller Representative with all written communications
with a Tax Authority (including drafts of communications to a Tax Authority)
with respect to any Tax Proceeding, (ii) consider in good faith the Seller
Representative's comments to any such written communications (including
drafts) and (iii) not resolve any Tax Proceeding that would result in a claim
for indemnification under Article VII against the Sellers without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event of any conflict
between this Section 5.13 and any provision of Article VII, this Section 5.13
shall control.

  

  

(i) Tax Carryforwards. The Company agrees to, and to cause the Subsidiaries
to, cooperate with Buyer and provide any available factual information
reasonably requested by Buyer that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to
determine the limitations, if any, on the Company's or any Subsidiary's tax
loss or credit carryforwards under Sections 382 or 383 or limitations under
Section 384 of the Code or any similar provision of Law of any other
jurisdiction applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

  

  

(j) Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller shall cause all Tax Sharing Agreements with
respect to each of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and shall ensure that such agreements are of no further force or
effect as to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries on and after the Closing
Date and that there shall be no further liabilities or obligations imposed on
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any such agreements.

  

  

5.14. Security Rights.

  

  

(a) Restricted Shares. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all action
necessary to (i) terminate the Plan and (ii) accelerate the vesting of the
Restricted Shares, effective as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(b) Security Rights. The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure
that all Security Rights are terminated as of immediately prior to the
Closing.

  

  

5.15. Indemnification of Company Board and Officers; Insurance.

  

  

(a) Indemnification Obligations. For not less than six (6) years after the
Closing Date, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of present and former members of
the Company Board and present and former officers of the Company (the
"Indemnified DandOs") than are currently set forth in the Company's
Organizational Documents or in indemnification agreements entered into by
Indemnified DandOs prior to the Closing Date in form and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

  substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer in compliance with Section 5.1
unless Buyer agrees to directly assume such indemnification obligations which
obligations Buyer shall thereafter fulfill and honor in all respects;
provided, however, that if the Company consummates any transaction pursuant to
which the Company is merged with, or all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company are transferred to, another Person, Buyer shall directly assume
all such indemnification obligations for the remainder of the six-year period.

 

  

  

(b) After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company, shall, and shall cause the
Company as the Surviving Corporation to, until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents relating to the
conduct of the Company Board that are made available by the Company to Buyer
hereunder on or prior to the Closing Date, and make the same reasonably
available for inspection and copying by the Seller Representative (at the
Seller Representative's expense) during normal business hours of the Company
upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice.

  

  

(c) Insurance. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage in a form acceptable to Buyer that
shall provide the members of the Company Board and the Company's officers with
coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the
insured persons than the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company (the "Extended DandOs
Coverage").

  

  

(d) Pursuant to Section 10.6(c), the provisions of this Section 5.15 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified DandOs and their heirs and estates.

  

  

5.16. Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of (a) all members of the Company Board and all officers of the
Company effective as of the Closing and (b) such officers and directors of
each of the Subsidiaries as Buyer designates in writing effective as of the
date such resignation is accepted by the Company.

  

  

5.17. RELEASE AND WAIVER. EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CLOSING, EACH SELLER HEREBY
RELEASES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE COMPANY, THE SUBSIDIARIES, BUYER AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, STOCKHOLDERS, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, ASSIGNS,
PREDECESSORS AND SUCCESSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "RELEASED PARTIES") FROM ANY
AND ALL LEGAL, EQUITABLE OR OTHER CLAIMS, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED
OR UNSUSPECTED, WITH RESPECT TO ITS OWNERSHIP OF ANY EQUITY INTEREST IN THE
COMPANY (INCLUDING ANY COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK OR ANY COMPANY STOCK RIGHTS) OR
ANY MATTER RELATED THERETO EXCEPT FOR ANY CLAIMS IT HAS OR MAY HAVE AFTER THE
CLOSING IN ITS CAPACITY AS A "SELLER" AGAINST BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT.

Closing Date, the Company shall deliver a proper notice, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.5 of the Loan Agreement, as amended, to Wells

that the Indebtedness under the Loan Agreement shall be prepaid in full in
connection with the Transactions on the Closing Date.

any of the Subsidiaries' business or assets as a result of the Transactions
that if successful would have a material and adverse effect on Buyer's ability
to receive the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.

preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of

for their review copies of the certificate(s) representing such Seller's
Shares as set forth on Schedule 2.6(a) hereto, duly and properly endorsed for

with evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that either (i) requisite
stockholder approval with respect to the Section 280G Payments was obtained
pursuant to the stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code; or (ii) such stockholder approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to
the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments,
pursuant to waivers of those payments and/or benefits, which were executed by
the affected individuals prior to the vote.

Subsidiaries and each of their respective Employees, partners, members, agents
and Affiliates (the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all claims, losses,

Related Agreements delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the Related
Agreements to be true and correct in all respects as of the Agreement Date and
as of the Closing (disregarding for purposes of this Section 7.2(a)(i) any

(iv) any claims by (A) any current or former holder or alleged current or
former holder of any equity or ownership interest or equity security of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including any predecessors), including
Company Securities, Subsidiary Securities or Security Rights with respect
thereto, relating to or arising out of (1) the Transactions, this Agreement,
the Related Agreements or the allocation of the Purchase Price or (2) such
Person's status or alleged status as an equity holder or owner of equity or
ownership interests in the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including any
predecessors) at any time at or prior to the Closing, whether for breach of
fiduciary duty or otherwise, (B) any Person to the effect that such Person is
entitled to any equity or ownership interest or equity security or any payment
in connection with the Transactions other than as specifically set forth on
the Allocation Certificate or (C) notwithstanding any disclosure in the
Company Disclosure Schedule, any Person with respect to any Security Right,
stock option scheme or plan, unit option scheme or plan or any other scheme,
plan, policy or agreement providing for equity or ownership interest
compensation to any Person;

  

  

(v) (A) regardless of any disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedule, any
"excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code)
made by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date
or otherwise required to be paid by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
pursuant to agreements, Change in Control Agreements or Company Employee Plans
entered into or adopted on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) any Losses
related to or in respect of a Company Employee Plan arising out of the Company
being or having been an ERISA Affiliate of any Person other than the

(vi) (A) any Pre-Closing Taxes, other than Taxes imposed as the result of any

Tax Law)) made after the Closing; (B) as a result of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar or corresponding provision of state, local or

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with whom the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries otherwise joins or has ever joined (or is or has ever been
required to join) in filing any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
Tax Return, prior to the Closing Date; and (C) any increase in Tax liability
resulting from the Company or any of the Subsidiaries being liable for Taxes
of any Person as transferee or successor as a result of transactions entered
into before the Closing, or by reason of a Tax Sharing Agreement entered into
before the Closing;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56

(viii) regardless of any disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedule, any
Losses incurred by Buyer in connection with the matters set forth on Schedule
7.2(a)(viii); or

  

  

(ix) regardless of any disclosure on the Company Disclosure Schedule, any
Losses incurred in connection with the matters set forth on Schedule
7.2(a)(ix).

  

  

(b) The Escrow Amount shall be the initial source of recourse available to
reimburse the Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.2. The Indemnified Parties shall
not proceed directly against any Seller individually with respect to any
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VII until the Indemnified
Parties have made claims for Losses with respect to the entire amount of the
Escrow Amount then being held by the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company is
entitled to pursue a claim for indemnification under any of the purchase
agreements (each, a "Roll-Up Agreement") pursuant to which the Company merged
with, acquired or otherwise entered into a business combination with any of
the Roll-Up Targets (the "Roll-Up Target Claims"), Buyer shall cause the
Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such right
against the obligated counterparty or counterparties to such Roll-Up
Agreement; provided, however, that (i) the pursuit of any Roll-Up Target Claim
shall not preclude any Indemnified Party from delivering a Claim Certificate
to be indemnified for any Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.2 prior to the
resolution, or abandonment of, the Roll-Up Target Claim, although, subject to
Section 7.2(c)(iii), the resolution of such Claim Certificate shall be tolled
until the Roll-Up Target Claim is resolved or abandoned, as the case may be;
(ii) if an Indemnified Party recovers any amounts in respect of Losses from
such Roll-Up Target Claim at any time after the payment of all or a portion of
such Losses to an Indemnified Party, from the Escrow Agent or the Sellers
under the provisions of this Article VII, such that the Indemnified Parties
have recovered, in the aggregate, more than the amount of Losses incurred by
the Indemnified Parties in connection with all Roll-Up Target Claims, the
Indemnified Parties shall, or shall cause the Company to, promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) pay to the Escrow Agent or, if after the
Final Distribution Date, the Sellers, as applicable, the amount of any such
excess and, if prior to the Final Distribution Date, such amount shall become
available to satisfy any other claims made by any Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Article VII; and (iii) if the maximum amount recoverable in connection
with a Roll-Up Target Claim under a Roll-Up Agreement is less than the Losses
for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 7.2, the resolution of the Claim Certificate for the amount of
any Losses in excess of the maximum recoverable amount shall be subject to the
procedures set forth in Section 7.4 and shall not be tolled as provided in
clause (i) above.

  

  

7.3. Limitations.

  

  

(a) Deductible Amount. No claim may be made by any Indemnified Party for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Parties seek to be indemnified
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) and Section 7.2(a)(vi) (with respect to claims
for which indemnification would be available under Section 7.2(a)(i)) exceeds
$750,000, at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for any and all Losses in excess of such amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Caps. Subject to Section 7.3(d), each Seller's indemnification obligations
under Section 7.2 are subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 7.3(b), each Seller shall be liable
up to such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the amounts then available in the Escrow
Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) for any Losses indemnifiable under
Section 7.2(a), other than Losses indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(vii) for
which each Seller shall only be liable up to such Seller's Pro Rata Share of
$1,000,000 of the Escrow Fund, to the extent then available in the Escrow
Fund;

  

  

(ii) Each Seller shall be liable up to the portion of the Purchase Price
actually received by such Seller (including, but subject to Section 7.2(b),
the deemed receipt by each Seller of such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Fund) for Losses indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(i) with respect to
any Fundamental Representation, and with respect to Sections 7.2(a)(iv), if
the claims that are the subject matter thereof, if true, would entitle an
Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) for the
breach of a Fundamental Representation; and

  

  

(iii) After the Claims Deadline (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) until the
Expiration Date, each Seller shall be liable solely up to such Seller's Pro
Rata Share of $22,000,000 (as reduced by any amounts subject to an outstanding
Claim Certificate, distributed to or reserved for distribution to Buyer
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or otherwise received from the Sellers
pursuant to Article VII) for Losses indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(i) with
respect to any Fundamental Tax Representation.

  

  

(c) Exclusive Remedy for Monetary Damages. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy for money
damages for any matter arising under this Agreement shall be the right to make
claims against the Escrow Fund pursuant hereto and pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement except: (i) as provided in Section 7.3(d); (ii) for Losses
indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(i) with respect to any Fundamental
Representation, subject to Section 7.2(b) and the limitations in Section
7.3(b)(ii); and (iii) for Losses indemnifiable under Section 7.2(a)(i) with
respect to any Fundamental Tax Representation, subject to Section 7.2(b) and
the limitations in Section 7.3(b)(iii).

  

  

(d) Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
limitations and thresholds and other provisions set forth in this Article VII
shall not apply with respect to (i) fraud under applicable law or (ii) any
equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance.

  

  

(e) Insurance; Purchase Price Reductions. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under an insurance policy, less
any out-of-pockets expenses incurred in connection with pursuing such
recovery. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Article VII shall be net of any amounts attributable to the relevant or
applicable breach that reduced the Purchase Price pursuant to Article I.

  

  

7.4. Procedures.

  

  

(a) General. If an Indemnified Party desires to bring a claim for
indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or Buyer, on such
Indemnified Party's behalf) shall first deliver to the Seller Representative a
certificate (a "Claim Certificate") that:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) states that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses, or
reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability for Losses, for
which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement; and

  

  

(ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable and available,
the Losses included in the amount so stated, the basis for any anticipated
liability or the date on which such item was paid or properly accrued, as
applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty
or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and, to the
extent computable, the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

  

  

(b) Objection. If the Seller Representative objects to the indemnification of
an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims specified in any Claim
Certificate, the Seller Representative shall deliver a written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection and the amount in
dispute to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Seller Representative of such Claim Certificate. Thereafter, the Seller
Representative and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties for a period of not less than sixty
(60) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of such written objection
with respect to each of such claims to which the Seller Representative has
objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Seller Representative agree with
respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Seller
Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such
agreement and, if applicable, a written instruction to the Escrow Agent.
Should the Indemnified Party and the Seller Representative fail to agree as to
any particular item or items or amount or amounts within such sixty (60) day
period, then either party shall be entitled to pursue its available remedies
for resolving its claim for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that the Indemnified Party seeks recovery against the Escrow Fund,
the time periods set forth herein shall run concurrently with and be without
duplication of the time periods set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(c) Indemnified Party Defense; Settlement. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of any claim brought
by a third-party (a "Third-Party Claim"); provided, however, that the Sellers
shall not be liable for any settlement, or compromise of any such Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If any
such action or claim is so settled with the consent of the Seller
Representative, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such
action, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the
amount of any Loss relating thereto.

  

  

(d) Seller Defense; Settlement. In the event the Indemnified Party elects not
to defend the Third-Party Claim, the Seller Representative may defend such
claim at the Sellers' sole cost and expense with counsel selected by the
Seller Representative, such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party. In such event, neither the Seller Representative nor any
Seller shall have any right to settle, adjust or compromise any Third-Party
Claim without the express written consent of the Indemnified Party against
whom the Third-Party Claim has been asserted, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(e) Agreed Claims. Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to
which the Seller Representative did not object in writing by 11:59 PM Eastern
time on the thirtieth (30th) day following the receipt of such Claim
Certificate by the Seller Representative, claims for Losses covered by a
memorandum of agreement of the nature described in Section 7.4(b) and claims
for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of
resolution by binding arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial
determination are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Agreed Claims."
The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed Claim within
ten (10) Business Days of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

  determination of the amount of any such Agreed Claims; provided, however,
that all payments made from the Escrow Amount shall be made as soon as
practicable.

 

  

  

(f) Timing of Claim Certificate. Subject to Section 7.1, the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to determine the timing of delivery of any Claim
Certificate in their sole discretion.

  

  

7.5. Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Buyer, each Seller and the Seller
Representative agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this
Article VII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes and
shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable
Tax Law.

  

  

7.6. Seller Representative; Power of Attorney.

  

  

(a) Appointment. By executing this Agreement, each Seller hereby initially
appoints, as of the Agreement Date, Servigistics, LLC (together with its
permitted successors, the "Seller Representative"), as his, her or its true
and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to enter into any Related Agreement and
any transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including other agreements in
connection with the Transactions), and to: (i) give and receive notices and
communications to or from Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified
Party) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or any of the Transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or
thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by the Sellers individually); (ii) authorize deliveries (including by
means of not objecting to claims) to Buyer of cash from the Escrow Amount in
satisfaction of claims asserted by Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Party, including by not objecting to claims thereto) and authorize
payments to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; (iii) object to any claims by Buyer or any other Indemnified Party,
including any claims to the Escrow Amount; (iv) consent or agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims; (v) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against
any Seller or by any Seller against any Indemnified Party or any dispute
between any Indemnified Party and any Seller, in each case relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; (vi) amend or terminate this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
other Related Agreement or any other agreement referred to herein or
contemplated hereby, or waive any provision thereof in accordance with the
respective terms of such Agreement; (vii) consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it; (viii) take
any and all actions under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any Related
Agreement permitted to or required of the Seller Representative (including
under Article I, Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII and Article
IX; and (viii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance. Each Seller further agrees to provide the Seller Representative
with any information requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
Transactions.

  

  

(b) Acceptance. Servigistics, LLC hereby accepts its appointment as the Seller
Representative.

  

  

(c) No Revocation; Replacement. Each Seller acknowledges that Buyer is relying
and shall rely on the authority of the Seller Representative granted hereunder
and will be materially prejudiced if this authority is revoked. Each Seller
hereby agrees that it shall indemnify Buyer and each other Indemnified Party
for any Losses suffered by Buyer or any other Indemnified Party as a result of
a

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

  revocation by such Seller of the authority granted hereunder other than as
provided for herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Person serving as the
Seller Representative may be replaced from time to time by Sellers holding a
majority in interest of the Escrow Amount upon not less than ten (10) days'
prior written notice to Buyer and with Buyer's written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no
consent of Buyer shall be required to replace the Seller Representative with
an Affiliate of the initial Seller Representative or a professional
stockholder representative (such as Shareholder Representative Services). No
bond shall be required of the Seller Representative, and the Seller
Representative shall receive no compensation for its services. Notices or
communications to or from the Seller Representative shall constitute notice to
or from each Seller.

 

  

  

(d) No Liability. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Seller
for any act done or omitted under this Agreement or under the Escrow Agreement
as the Seller Representative while acting in good faith and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. Each Seller, severally and not jointly in accordance with his, her
or its Pro Rata Share, shall indemnify the Seller Representative and hold it
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Seller Representative and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement. To the extent that any distributions
of the Escrow Amount are being made to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, the Seller Representative may receive reimbursement from
the Sellers directly out of any such distributions that are being made to the
Sellers for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities, including
attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in the
performance or discharge of his rights and obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that neither Buyer nor the Company shall have any liability
with respect to such items.

  

  

(e) Notice. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Seller
Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all Sellers, and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller; and each Indemnified
Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice,
communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of
time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a
notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Seller. Each Indemnified Party and the
Escrow Agent is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts
done by them in accordance with any such notice, communication, decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of the Seller Representative.

  

  

(f) Role of the Seller Representative. Without limiting the generality or
effect of Section 7.6(a), any claims or disputes between or among any
Indemnified Party, the Seller Representative and/or any one or more Sellers
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Transactions shall in

(c) EACH OF THE SELLER REPRESENTATIVE, COMPANY, EACH SELLER AND BUYER (i)

preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  

  

10.11. Counterparts; Facsimile Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in two

10.13. Waiver of Conflict. The parties intend that Servigistics, LLC and each
Seller shall have the right, should each so choose, to have the benefit of
representation by Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation
("WSGR") in connection with matters under this Agreement and the Related
Agreements (the "Specified Matters"). Accordingly, each party agrees that this
Agreement will (a) constitute consultation with respect to the potential
conflict of interest that WSGR may have as a result of its representation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries both historically and in connection with this
Agreement and the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, (b) confirm that each party understands the risks associated with
potential conflicts of interest and that the parties have alternatives to
waiving the potential conflict (including refusing to waive the potential
conflict or declining to engage in the matter giving rise to the potential
conflict) and (c) that the parties still wish to consent to WSGR's
representation, if requested, of Servigistics, LLC and/or each Seller in
connection with the Specified Matters, and waive any conflicts of interest
which may exist as a result of such representation, including in connection
with any suit, claim, counterclaim, action, arbitration or proceeding arising
among the parties, or any of them, regarding this Agreement or the Related
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.13 shall
constitute or be construed as granting any release of WSGR with respect to any
obligations of confidentiality or ethics or with respect to the preservation
of attorney-client privilege owed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than (and solely) with respect to a Specified Matter.

EXHIBIT A

  

  

To Stock Purchase Agreement

  

  


 

  

ESCROW AGREEMENT

  

  

This Escrow Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of ____________,
2012 by and among Parametric Technology Corporation, a Massachusetts
corporation ("Buyer"), Servigistics, LLC (the "Seller Representative"), and
U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Buyer and the Seller Representative are sometimes
referred to herein as the "Interested Parties."

  

  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Servigistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
the Seller Representative, and the stockholders of the Company listed on
Schedule I thereto (each a "Seller" and collectively the "Sellers") have
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of August 7, 2012 (the "Stock
Purchase Agreement") under which a portion of the consideration payable to the
Sellers is being placed in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") to be held
by Escrow Agent for the purpose of satisfying purchase price adjustments,
indemnification and certain other obligations of the Sellers as set forth in
the Stock Purchase Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have appointed
the Seller Representative to represent them for all purposes in connection
with the funds to be deposited with Escrow Agent and with this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties wish to engage the Escrow Agent to act, and
the Escrow Agent is willing to act, as escrow agent hereunder and, in that
capacity, to hold, administer and distribute the amounts deposited in escrow
hereunder in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

Section 1. Definitions.

  

  

As used in this Agreement:

  

  

(a) "Business Day" means Monday through Friday, but excluding any day on which
Escrow Agent is not open for business.

  

  

(b) "Claims Deadline" means 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date or, if such date is not a Business
Day, then the next succeeding Business Day.

  

  

(c) "Closing Date" means the date first set forth above.

  

  

(d) "Eligible Investments" means [(i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the
United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof (provided
that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged in support
thereof); (ii) repurchase obligations for underlying securities of the type
described in clause (i); [(iii) commercial paper at the time of the investment
rated A-1 by Standard and Poors Corporation or P-1 by Moody's Investor Services,
Inc.; (iv) shares of a money market fund investing only in underlying
securities described in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

  clauses (i) through (iii) above;] (v) obligations (including certificates
of deposit and banker's acceptances) of any domestic commercial bank having
capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000; (vi) investment in the Escrow
Agent's "Money Market Deposit Account" ("MMDA"), as described in Annex A
hereto. If otherwise qualified, obligations of the Escrow Agent or any of its
affiliates shall qualify as Eligible Investments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Eligible Investments shall be limited to those instruments readily
obtainable and routinely offered by the Escrow Agent's Corporate Trust
Services.]

 

  

  

(e) "Final Claim" has the meaning given in Section 3(d)(i).

  

  

(f) "Final Distribution Date" means the later of (i) the Claims Deadline and
(ii) the date on which there are no Unresolved Claims (as defined in Section
3(d)(ii)).

  

  

(g) Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings given to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

  

  


 

  

  

Section 2. Deposit of Escrow Funds. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
on the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent
Twenty-Two Million Dollars ($22,0000,000) in immediately available funds (such
funds, together with any investment income or proceeds received by the Escrow
Agent from the investment thereof from time to time pursuant to Section 5
below, collectively, the "Escrow Funds"), and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold
the Escrow Funds in an account established with the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Account"), and to administer the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Upon the Escrow Agent's receipt of the Escrow Funds, the
Escrow Agent shall acknowledge receipt of the Escrow Funds in writing by
executing and delivering to each of the Interested Parties, a receipt in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit IA.

  

  

Section 3. Claims and Payment; Release from Escrow.

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Adjustment. After the Final Purchase Price is determined
pursuant to Section 1.5 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, if Buyer is entitled
to receive any distribution under Section 1.6(a) of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, an authorized officer of Buyer will deliver to the Escrow Agent
disbursement instructions executed by both Buyer and the Seller Representative
for such amount in the form of Exhibit IB hereto. As soon as practicable
following the receipt of the disbursement instructions, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver to Buyer a portion of the Escrow Funds in the amount set forth
therein, up to the then-available Escrow Funds.

  

  

(b) Indemnification Claims. If an Indemnified Party asserts a claim against
the Escrow Funds pursuant to Article VII of the Stock Purchase Agreement (a
"Claim"), such Indemnified Party (or Buyer, on such Indemnified Party's
behalf) shall deliver a notice thereof (a "Claim Certificate") to the Seller
Representative, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, which such notice shall: (i)
state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses, or
reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability for Losses, for
which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
the Stock Purchase Agreement and (ii) specify in reasonable detail, to the
extent practicable and available, the Losses included in the amount so stated,
the basis for any anticipated liability or the date on which such item was
paid or properly accrued, as applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation,
default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or claim to which each such
item is related and, to the extent computable, the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

  computation of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be
entitled thereunder.

 

  

  

(c) Contested Claims.

  

  

(i) To contest any Claim, the Seller Representative must deliver written
notice of such contest to the Indemnified Party, with a copy to the Escrow
Agent (an "Objection"), which Objection must be received by the Indemnified
Party no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the thirtieth (30) calendar day
after receipt by the Seller Representative of the respective Claim
Certificate. The Objection shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of
the Seller Representative's objection to the Claim or Claims and the amount in
dispute. If the Objection relates only to a portion of the Claim, the portion
of the Claim not subject to the Objection shall be released to the Indemnified
Party as promptly as practicable (up to the then-available Escrow Funds).

  

  

(ii) If the Seller Representative fails to deliver a timely Objection to the
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 3(c)(i) or only delivers a timely
Objection with respect to a portion of the Claim, the Indemnified Party may
deliver to the Escrow Agent the applicable Claim Certificate and a certificate
executed by an authorized officer of such Indemnified Party certifying that
such Indemnified Party failed to receive a timely objection or that the
Objection received was only with respect to a portion of the Claim, as
applicable, (together, the "Accepted Claim Certificate") and the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the amount requested in
such Accepted Claim Certificate (up to the then-available Escrow Funds).

  

  

(iii) If the Seller Representative delivers a timely Objection with respect to
all or any portion of a Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall not
disburse, and shall continue to hold in the Escrow Account, the amount
requested in the Claim Certificate or the disputed portion thereof, as
applicable, pending receipt of either (A) written instructions to the Escrow
Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit IC hereto, executed by both the
Indemnified Party and the Seller Representative specifying the action to be
taken by the Escrow Agent in respect of such Claim Certificate ("Joint Written
Instructions"), or (B) a notice to all other parties to this Agreement from
either the Indemnified Party or the Seller Representative stating that such
Claim Certificate has been submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction for
judgment and that a judgment with respect to such matters has been rendered
and is final and non-appealable (in each case, a "Judgment Notice"), which
Judgment Notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the final, non-appealable
judgment of such court (each, an "Order"), pursuant to which such court has
determined whether and to what extent the Indemnified Party is entitled to the
amount requested in the Claim Certificate.

  

  

(d) Final Claims.

  

  

(i) A Claim shall become a "Final Claim" upon any one of the following events:

  

  

(A) the Indemnified Party delivers to the Escrow Agent an Accepted Claim
Certificate, in which case the amount of the Final Claim shall equal the
amount set forth in the related Claim Certificate;

  

  

(B) the Escrow Agent shall have received Joint Written Instructions, in which
case the amount of the Final Claim shall be equal to the amount set

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

forth in such Joint Written Instructions; or

  

  

(C) the Indemnified Party or the Seller Representative shall have provided the
Escrow Agent with a Judgment Notice and underlying Order, in which case the
amount of the Final Claim shall equal the amount, if any, awarded to the
Indemnified Party by such Judgment Notice and underlying Order and set forth
in the related Claim Certificate.

  

  

(ii) Until such time as a Claim for which a Claim Certificate has been timely
delivered shall (A) become a Final Claim or (B) be withdrawn by written notice
delivered by the claimant to the Escrow Agent, it shall be an "Unresolved
Claim." The amount of the Unresolved Claim shall be the amount set forth in
the related Claim Certificate.

  

  

(iii) As soon as practicable following the date a Claim becomes a Final Claim
(a "Final Claim Date"), and in any event within four (4) Business Days
thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall deliver, to the Indemnified Party, an
amount of the Escrow Funds equal to the amount of the Final Claim (to the
extent there is a sufficient amount of then-available Escrow Funds). If such
Judgment Notice and Order indicates that the Indemnified Parties were not
entitled to all or any portion of the amount claimed in the Claim Certificate,
then the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount to which the
Indemnified Parties were determined not to be entitled in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 4. Release of Funds

  

  

(a) Initial Release. Within four (4) Business Days after the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Initial Release Date"), the Escrow Agent
shall:

  

  

(i) distribute to the Seller Representative an amount of Escrow Funds equal to
one-half of the portion of Escrow Funds not subject to any (A) Unresolved
Claims existing as of the Initial Release Date or (B) Final Claims which have
not yet been disbursed to the Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) Claims Deadline. Within four (4) Business Days after the Claims Deadline,
the Escrow Agent shall:

  

  

(i) retain an amount of Escrow Funds (after taking into account any
distribution to the Seller Representative pursuant to Section 4(a)(i)) equal
to the aggregate amount of (without duplication) (A) all Unresolved Claims
existing as of the Claims Deadline, if any, (B) any Final Claims which have
not yet been disbursed to the Indemnified Party with such amounts to be held
and distributed in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii), and (C) the amount of
any Distributable Interest Amount for any year or partial year for which Buyer
has or will have Allocated Income that has not yet been disbursed to Buyer in
accordance with Section 8(c); and

  

  

(ii) distribute the remaining Escrow Funds, if any, to the Seller
Representative.

  

  

(c) Final Distribution Date. Within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Distribution Date, the Escrow Agent shall comply with Section 3(d)(iii) with
respect to the last Final Claim(s) and shall comply with Sections 4(b)(i) and
4(b)(ii) with respect to any remaining

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

  Escrow Funds; provided, that if any amount of the Escrow Funds are
retained pursuant to Section 4(b)(i), once an Unresolved Claim becomes a Final
Claim, the Escrow Agent shall, as applicable, (i) comply with Section
3(d)(iii) or (ii) within five (5) Business Days after such Unresolved Claim
becomes a Final Claim deliver to the Seller Representative the amount of the
Escrow Funds retained in respect of such Unresolved Claim so long as the
amount retained by the Escrow Agent thereafter is not less than the amount of
all remaining Unresolved Claims in the aggregate.

 

  

  

Section 5. Investment of Escrow Funds

  

  

(a) If the Escrow Agent shall have received specific written investment
instruction from both the Seller Representative and Buyer (which shall include
instruction as to term to maturity, if applicable), on a timely basis, the
Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in Eligible Investments, pursuant
to and as directed in such instruction.

  

  

(b) Escrow Agent Not Responsible For Investment Decisions. Absent its timely
receipt of such specific written investment instruction from the Seller
Representative and Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or duty to
invest (or otherwise pay interest on) the Escrow Funds; provided, however,
that in the event the Escrow Agent shall not have received such written
investment instruction, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Funds in the
Escrow Agent's MMDA, as described in Annex A hereto, until such investment
instruction is received. All earnings received from the investment of the
Escrow Funds (the "Escrow Income") shall be credited to, and shall become a
part of, the Escrow Account (and any losses on such investments shall be
debited to the Escrow Account). The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for
any investment losses, including without limitation any market loss on any
investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a payment required
hereunder.

  

  

(c) Transaction Confirmations. The parties hereto acknowledge that, to the
extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other applicable
regulatory entity, grant the parties the right to receive individual
confirmations of security transactions at no additional cost, as they occur,
the parties specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent
permitted by law. The Escrow Agent will furnish the parties hereto with
periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment
transactions made by the Escrow Agent hereunder, for any investment made
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.

  

  

Section 6. Concerning the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(a) Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent (i)
shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred to or described
herein (including without limitation the Stock Purchase Agreement), or for
determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be
bound thereby, (ii) shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties
as are expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement on its part to
be performed, each of which is ministerial (and shall not be construed to be
fiduciary) in nature, and no implied duties or obligations of any kind shall
be read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Escrow Agent, (iii)
shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which might
in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any expense or liability unless
it shall have been furnished with reasonably acceptable indemnification, (iv)
may rely on and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon
any written notice, instruction (including, without limitation, wire transfer
instructions, whether incorporated herein or provided in a separate written
instruction), instrument, statement, certificate, request or other document
furnished to it hereunder and reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper person, and shall have no
responsibility or duty to make inquiry as to or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

  to determine the genuineness, accuracy or validity thereof (or any
signature appearing thereon), or of the authority of the person signing or
presenting the same, and (v) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, including
in-house counsel, and the opinion or advice of such counsel in any instance
shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in
accordance with the opinion or advice of such counsel.

 

  

  

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it hereunder except in the case of the Escrow Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct in breach of the terms of this
Agreement. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for indirect,
punitive, special or consequential damage or loss (including but not limited
to lost profits) whatsoever, even if the Escrow Agent has been informed of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

  

  

(c) The Escrow Agent shall have no more or less responsibility or liability on
account of any action or omission of any book-entry depository, securities
intermediary or other sub-escrow agent employed by the Escrow Agent than it
shall have for its own actions or omissions hereunder.

  

  

(d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such
affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person
or dealing as principal for its own account.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding any term of this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance
shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any Escrow Funds
(or take other action than may be called for hereunder to be taken by the
Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has received the
applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form, or (ii)
passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under the terms
of this Agreement), as the case may be.

  

  

(f) Unless and except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein, all
deposits and payments hereunder, or pursuant to the terms hereof (including
without limitation all payments to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 7),
shall be in U.S. dollars.

  

  

Section 7. Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The fees and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees) of
the Escrow Agent in connection with its preparation and performance of this
Escrow Agreement, as set forth on the fee schedule attached as Exhibit II
hereto, shall be paid by Buyer.

  

  

(b) Subject to Buyer's obligations in Section 7(a), each of the Interested
Parties covenants and agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow
Agent and its directors, officers and employees (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") and hold each of them harmless from and against any loss,
liability, damage, cost and expense of any nature incurred by the Escrow Agent
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or with the administration
of its duties hereunder, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's
fees, tax liabilities (other than income tax liabilities associated with the
Escrow Agent's fees), and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing
to defend against any claim of liability unless and except to the extent such
loss, liability, damage, cost and expense shall be caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee. An Indemnitee shall notify
the Interested Parties promptly after

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

  receipt of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding, or
threat thereof, by a third party for which indemnification may be sought;
provided that the failure to do so shall not relieve the Interested Parties of
their obligations hereunder except to the extent they are prejudiced thereby.
The Interested Parties (or any of them) may participate in, and, to the extent
they elect, assume and control the defense of any such action or proceeding
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee
shall cooperate fully with the Interested Parties, at the Interested Parties'
expense, in defense of such claim. The Interested Parties shall not be
obligated to pay any legal fees or costs of separate counsel incurred without
the consent of the respective Interested Party after such Interested Party has
elected to assume the defense of such an action or proceeding; provided that
the Interested Parties shall pay the fees and costs of one counsel for all
Indemnitees the representation of whom by the Interested Parties' counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
such Indemnitees and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding. No Indemnitee shall concede wrongdoing nor make any compromise or
settlement in any action or proceeding without the respective Interested
Party's prior written consent. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to
hold harmless shall (i) survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) be
borne one-half (1/2) by the Sellers (in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata
Share) and one-half (1/2) by Buyer.

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall
have and is hereby granted a possessory lien on and security interest in the
Escrow Funds, and all proceeds thereof, to secure payment of all amounts owing
to it from time to time hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter arising.
The Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct from the Escrow Funds, and
proceeds thereof, any such sums to be borne by the Sellers under this Section
7, upon ten (10) Business Days' written notice to the Interested Parties of
its intent to do so.

  

  

Section 8. Tax Provisions.

  

  

(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to treat, and the Interested
Parties hereby agree to treat, all interest, dividends, proceeds of sale and
other income earned on the Escrow Funds as being earned by Buyer for
applicable income tax purposes. The Escrow Agent shall file all information or
other similar returns reflecting income on the Escrow Funds earned by Buyer
and the distribution of the Escrow Funds as are required by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and applicable Treasury
regulations. The Escrow Agent shall prepare and file any Forms 1099-B and any
other information or similar tax returns required to be filed in respect of a
disbursement of the Escrow Funds to the Sellers.

  

  

(b) The responsibility to prepare and file any and all required income or
other tax returns (other than information or other similar returns required to
be filed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 8) applicable to the
Escrow Funds, or the income earned thereon, with the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS"), as and to the extent required under the Code and applicable
Treasury regulations, and under applicable state and local laws, is that of
Buyer, and not the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar year in
respect of which Escrow Income is allocated to Buyer pursuant to this Section
8 (the "Allocated Income"), the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Buyer an
amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the amount of such Allocated Income
(the "Distributable Interest Amount") from the Escrow Funds. Any Distributable
Interest Amount distributed to Buyer in accordance with this Section 8(c)
shall not be credited toward amounts that would otherwise be required to be
distributed to Buyer pursuant

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

  to Section 3. The Escrow Agent shall deliver to Buyer a copy of each tax
reporting form submitted to the IRS to report the Allocated Income within
thirty (30) days of each calendar year end.

 

  

  

(d) The Seller Representative shall be responsible for making an affirmative
communication to the Escrow Agent if the securities being exchanged, redeemed,
or sold are classified as "Covered Securities" or "Non-Covered Securities"
under Section 6045(g) of the Code. If such securities are classified as
"Covered Securities", the Seller Representative shall be responsible for
providing the required information to the Escrow Agent for sending accurate
and complete Form 1099-B information to the shareholders. The required
information shall be each shareholder's date of acquisition and each
shareholder's cost basis of the applicable security, and any such other
information that the Escrow Agent may request to be in compliance with the IRS
1099-B reporting regulations under the Internal Revenue Code. The information
shall be provided timely to the Escrow Agent so it can meet its obligations to
send Form 1099-B information to the shareholders and the IRS by the applicable
reporting deadlines. The Buyer may review, supplement or correct any
information provided to the Escrow Agent by the Seller Representative.

  

  

The Seller Representative will be responsible for providing guidance to the
Escrow Agent on the appropriate allocation of the cost basis to each
shareholder's distribution. In the event that shareholder proceeds are
allocated between the consideration payable at Closing and disbursements made
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Seller Representative will be
responsible for providing guidance on the pro-rata allocation of the
shareholder's cost basis to shareholder distributions from the Escrow Account.
The Escrow Agent shall rely upon such guidance to perform the required tax
reporting for shareholder distributions made from the Escrow Accounts.

  

  

(e) Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number. Each of the Interested
Parties hereto agrees to provide, and the Seller Representative agrees to
cause the Sellers to provide, the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or an appropriate
Form W-8, in case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent upon the execution
and delivery of this Agreement. The Interested Parties understand that, in the
event their tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent,
among other requirements, the Code, as amended from time to time, may require
withholding of a portion of any interest or other income earned on the
investment of the Escrow Property or the disbursement of the Escrowed Funds.
The Interested Parties also agree to provide the Escrow Agent with all
documentation necessary for the Escrow Agent to comply with any withholding or
reporting obligations required under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,
including Sections 1471 through 1474, et. seq., of the Code. Each of the
Interested Parties agrees to instruct the Escrow Agent in writing with respect
to the Escrow Agent's responsibility for withholding and other taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges, and to instruct the Escrow Agent
with respect to any certifications and governmental reporting that may be
required under any laws or regulations that may be applicable in connection
with its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9. Seller Representative.

  

  

(a) The Seller Representative represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that
it has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and
perform this Agreement and to bind all of the Sellers to its terms, (ii) to
give and receive directions and notices hereunder; and (iii) to make all
determinations that may be required or that it deems appropriate under this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Until notified in writing by the Seller Representative that it has
resigned or by a majority-in-interest of the Sellers that it has been removed,
the Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions,
instructions and notices of the Seller Representative named above and,
thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor
named in a writing executed by a majority-in-interest of the Sellers filed
with the Escrow Agent.

  

  


 

  

  

Section 10. Resignation.

  

  

The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as Escrow Agent hereunder by giving
thirty (30) days' prior written notice of resignation to Buyer and the Seller
Representative. In addition, Buyer and the Seller Representative may jointly
remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time, with or without cause, by
an instrument executed by Buyer and the Seller Representative (which may be
executed in counter parts) delivered to the Escrow Agent, which instrument
shall designate the effective date of such removal. In the event of any such
removal or resignation, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall use their
reasonable best efforts jointly to designate a successor escrow agent. Upon
designating a successor escrow agent, Buyer and the Seller Representative will
issue to the Escrow Agent a written instruction authorizing redelivery of the
Escrow Funds to a bank or trust company that they have selected as successor
to the Escrow Agent hereunder. If, however, Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall fail to name such a successor escrow agent within twenty
(20) days after such removal or receipt of the notice of resignation from the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
for appointment of a successor escrow agent. Any successor escrow agent
designated pursuant to this Section 10 shall be a commercial bank with assets
of not less than $10 billion. Upon delivery of the Escrow Fund to the
successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall have no further duties,
responsibilities or obligations hereunder.

  

  

Section 11. Jurisdiction and Service.

  

  

Each of the Interested Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that any action, suit or proceeding, at law or equity, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and solely between Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall only be brought in any federal court of the Southern
District of New York or any state court located in New York County, State of
New York, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally expressly submits to the
personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purposes thereof and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives (by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise) any and all jurisdictional, venue and convenience objections or
defenses that such party may have in such action, suit or proceeding, and to
any trial by jury to the extent permitted by applicable law. Each of the
Interest Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the
service of process of any of the aforementioned courts. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in
any manner permitted by law or commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other party in any other jurisdiction to enforce judgments
obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this section.

  

  

Each of the Interested Parties hereby absolutely and irrevocably consents and
submits to the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of New York and of any
Federal court located therein in connection with any actions or proceedings
brought against the Interested Parties (or any of them) by the Escrow Agent
arising out of or relating to this Escrow Agreement. In any such action or
proceeding, the Interested Parties each hereby absolutely and irrevocably (i)
waives any objection to jurisdiction or venue, (ii) waives personal service of
any summons, complaint, declaration or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

  other process, and (iii) agrees that the service thereof may be made by
certified or registered first-class mail directed to such party, as the case
may be, at their respective addresses in accordance with Section 14 hereof.

 

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that, should any
dispute arise with respect to the delivery, ownership, right of possession,
and/or disposition of the Escrow Funds, or should any claim be made upon the
Escrow Agent or the Escrow Funds by a third party, the Escrow Agent upon
receipt of notice of such dispute or claim is authorized and shall be entitled
(at its sole option and election) to retain in its possession without
liability to anyone, all or any of the Escrow Funds until such dispute shall
have been settled either by the mutual written agreement of the parties
involved, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final order, decree or
judgment of a court in the United States of America, the time for perfection
of an appeal of such order, decree or judgment having expired. The Escrow
Agent may, but shall be under no duty whatsoever to, institute or defend any
legal proceedings which relate to the Escrow Funds.

  

  

Section 12. Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

THE ESCROW AGENT AND EACH OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE A TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY AND ALL ISSUES ARISING IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THEM OR
THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF ITS PROVISIONS OR ANY NEGOTIATIONS IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

  

  

Section 13. Force Majeure.

  

  

The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in
performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include
but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war,
epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire,
communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or
other disasters.

  

  

Section 14. Notices; Wiring Instructions.

recognized courier or delivery service, or (ii) mailed by registered or

Section 15. Miscellaneous.

  

  

(a) Binding Effect; Successors; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon the respective parties hereto and their heirs, executors, successors and
assigns. If the Escrow Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or
transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business (including
the escrow contemplated by this Agreement) to, another corporation, the
successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall provide prompt notice to the Interested Parties
of any such consolidation, merger, conversion or transfer. No party may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Seller Representative,
except that Buyer may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder
to any Affiliate without the consent of the Seller Representative.

  

  

(b) Modifications. This Agreement may not be altered or modified without the
express written consent of the Escrow Agent, Buyer, and the Seller
Representative. No course of conduct shall constitute a waiver of any of the
terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement, unless such waiver is specified
in writing, and then only to the extent so specified. A waiver of any of the
terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement on one occasion shall not
constitute a waiver of the other terms of this Escrow Agreement, or of such
terms and conditions, on any other occasion. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, consent to an alteration or modification of this Agreement
may not be signed by means of an e-mail.

  

  

(c) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed by, the Laws of the State of New York without regard to the Laws of
such jurisdiction that would require the substantive Laws of another
jurisdiction to apply.

  

  

(d) Reproduction of Documents. This Agreement and all documents relating
hereto, including, without limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications
which may hereafter be executed, and (b) certificates and other information
previously or hereafter furnished, may be reproduced by any photographic,
photostatic, microfilm, optical disk, micro-card, miniature photographic or
other similar process. The parties agree that any such reproduction shall be
admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or
administrative proceeding, whether or not the original is in existence and
whether or not such reproduction was made by a party in the regular course of
business, and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such
reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

  

  

(e) Counterparts and Facsimile Execution. This Escrow Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be one and
the same

pages by facsimile (telecopy or PDF) transmission shall constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in

transmitted by facsimile shall be deemed to be their original signatures for
all purposes.

MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

  

DESCRIPTION AND TERMS

  


 

  


 

  

The U.S. Bank Money Market account is a U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S.

needs of U.S. Bank's Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other Corporate
Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes

U.S. Bank uses the daily balance method to calculate interest on this account
(actual/365 or 366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the
principal balance in the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and
credited monthly to the account. Interest rates are determined at U.S. Bank's
discretion, and may be tiered by customer deposit amount.

  


 

  

The owner of the account is U.S. Bank as Agent for its trust customers. U.S.

Annex B

  

  

Customer Identification Program Notice

  

  

Important information about procedures for opening a new Account

  


 

  

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions (which includes
the Escrow Agent) to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
each person who opens an account.

  


 

  

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or
other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its
formation and existence as a legal entity. Such documentation may include, but
is not limited to, Certificates of Good Standing from the appropriate
Secretary of State, certified copies of Partnership Agreements, Trust
Agreements or other formation agreements or documents. For companies whose
equity securities are publicly traded, these requirements can be met with
evidence of regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
found on their EDGAR database. We may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.

  


 

  

In addition, for non-individual entities, the Escrow Agent must be informed if
any contractual party is now acting, or has acted in the past 12 months, under
a different name, or has changed its name in the last 12 months.

  

  

For individuals, a copy of a government-issued identification, such as a
driver's license or passport, is required to establish identity for the
primary party responsible for the account, such as the Shareholder
Representative, as a signing party to the governing documents. Additionally,
any individual involved in the transaction will be required to provide a
certified Tax Identification Number on IRS Form W-9, or Form W-8 for non-US
Persons.

  

  

Any capitalized term used without definition in this Annex B is used with the
meaning assigned to such term in the Escrow Agreement of which this Annex B is
a part.
