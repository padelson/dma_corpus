If Cornerstone gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent (which Purchase Price Dispute Notice must set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and amounts in dispute) within such 30-day period, Parent and Cornerstone will use reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Parent receives the applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Cornerstone. If Cornerstone and Parent do not obtain a final resolution within such 30-day period, then the items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to the Bethesda, Maryland office of BDO Seidman, LLP (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall be required to render a determination of the applicable dispute within 60 days after referral of the matter to the Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon Cornerstone, Parent and the other parties hereto. Parent will revise the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(ii). The "Final Statement of Purchase Price" shall mean the Proposed Purchase Price Calculation together with any revisions thereto pursuant to this Section 2.9(b)(ii).    

 (iii) In the event Cornerstone and Parent submit any unresolved objections to an Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in Section 2.9(b)(ii) above, the responsibility for the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be as follows:    

 (A) if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as the "Low Value"), then all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid from the Escrow Amount;    

 (B) if the Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of Cornerstones position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as the "High Value"), then Parent will be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm; and    

 (C) if such Accounting Firm neither resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of Parents position nor resolves all of the remaining objections in favor of Cornerstones position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein as the "Actual Value"), then that fraction of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm equal to (x) the difference between the High    ##### 

  

   

Value and the Actual Value over (y) the difference between the High Value and
the Low Value shall be paid from the Escrow Account, and Parent will be
responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm.   

 (iv) Parent will make the financial records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries available to Cornerstone and its accountants and other representatives at reasonable times at any time during the review by Cornerstone of, and the resolution of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations. Cornerstone shall not disclose or make use of, and shall cause each of its accountants and other representatives not to disclose or make use of, any such information, other than to the extent necessary to enforce its rights hereunder.  

(c) Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price.    

 (i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Parent and/or Surviving Corporation will pay to each holder of the Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Common Shares) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and to each holder of Vested Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to, for each such share of Common Stock and/or for each share of Common Stock for which such Vested Option was exercisable for as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a Pro Rata Portion of such positive amount (as reduced by the last sentence of this Section 2.9(c)(i)), net of applicable withholding Taxes, if any, by check or by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, in each case, within three business days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such positive amount shall first be appropriately reduced by the amount payable to Broadview International LLC pursuant to the terms of the Broadview Engagement Letter as a result of the required payment to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i) (without regard to this last sentence of Section 2.9(c)(i)), and such reduced amount shall be paid by the Company to Broadview International LLC.   

 (ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three business days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b) above, the Surviving Corporation and Cornerstone shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the lesser of (x) an amount equal to such negative amount and (y) the amount of the Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account.   

 (d) Repayment of Loans. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, immediately following the Effective Time, the following:    

 (i) indebtedness outstanding in connection with the Credit Agreement;

 Section 2.10 _Conversion of Shares_.   

 (a) Conversion of Preferred Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof or any party hereto, each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares held in the Companys treasury or by any of the Subsidiaries and (ii) Dissenting Preferred Shares) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration, payable in cash to the holder thereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such share, all in accordance with Section 2.8 and Section 2.11.   

 (b) Conversion of Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof or any party hereto, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares held in the Companys treasury or by any of the Subsidiaries and (ii) Dissenting Common Shares) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration, payable in cash to the holder thereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such share, all in accordance with Section 2.9 and Section 2.11.   

 (c) Treasury Shares. Each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   

 (d) Newco Shares. As of the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Newco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Newco, be converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of the corresponding class of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 (e) Holders of Certificates. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Certificates, except the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration or the Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, with respect to each of the shares represented thereby.   

 Section 2.11 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

 (a) Upon surrender of any Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares), together with duly executed stock powers, on or prior to the Closing Date to Parent, Newco or the Surviving Corporation, the holder of each Certificate shall receive from the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date in exchange for each share of Preferred Stock or Common Stock evidenced thereby, the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Estimated Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, in the form of cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.8, Section 2.9 and/or Section 2.10, without interest. At the time of distribution of the information statement in accordance with    ##### 

  

 

Section 5.1, the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver to each
record holder of any Certificates a form of letter of transmittal for return
to the Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Company) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and payment therefor. At any time after
the Effective Time, upon surrender to the Surviving Corporation of any
Certificates (other than Certificates surrendered pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 2.11(a) and other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares), together with such duly executed letter of transmittal,
the holder of each such Certificate shall receive from the Surviving
Corporation immediately thereafter in exchange therefor, the Preferred Stock
Consideration or the Estimated Common Stock Consideration, as applicable,
payable in cash pursuant to Section 2.8, Section 2.9 and/or Section 2.10, in
the form of cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to such sections of the Agreement, without
interest; provided, however, that any such payments for less than $10,000 to
a particular holder may be made by check. Each Certificate surrendered
pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) shall be canceled. If payment or delivery is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer, that the signatures on the certificate or any related
stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such
payment either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11, each Certificate (other
than Certificates canceled pursuant to Section 2.10(c) and Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common
Stock Consideration, as applicable, in the form provided for by this
Agreement, without interest. Except as provided herein, all cash paid upon
surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.11 shall be
deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented thereby.    

 (b) In the event that any Certificate (other than any Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the registered holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in form and substance acceptable to Parent and Newco (if such affidavit is accepted before the Effective Time) or the Surviving Corporation (if such affidavit is accepted after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, in respect thereof in the manner set forth in Section 2.8, Section 2.9 and/or Section 2.10.   

 (c) If Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date that is three years after the Effective Time, unclaimed amounts (including interest thereon) of Preferred Stock Consideration and Common Stock Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation and may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors    ##### 

  

 

thereof for payment for their claims in the form and amounts to which
such stockholders are entitled.    

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Preferred Stock Consideration or the Common Stock Consideration, as applicable, as provided for, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Section 2.11.   

 Section 2.12 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by stockholders who shall have properly exercised their appraisal rights with respect thereto under Section 3-203 of the MGCL (such shares of Common Stock, the "Dissenting Common Shares", such shares of Preferred Stock, the "Dissenting Preferred Shares", and all such shares, collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Merger, but shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-203 of the MGCL, except that each Dissenting Share held by a stockholder who shall thereafter withdraw his or her demand for appraisal or shall fail to perfect his or her right to such payment as provided in such Section 3-203 shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration or Preferred Stock Consideration, as applicable, in the form such holder otherwise would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Merger.   

 Section 2.13 _Options._    

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of any Vested Option an amount of cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Estimated Common Stock Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock for which such Vested Option is exercisable, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Vested Option (such gross amount of cash, the "Estimated Option Consideration"). The payment of Estimated Option Consideration by the Company shall be net of applicable withholding taxes, if any. In addition, each holder of a Vested Option shall be entitled to receive for each share for which such Vested Option is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time (A) any applicable payment pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.9(c)(i) hereof, and (B) a Pro Rata Portion of any amounts payable, directly or indirectly, to the Company Securityholders from the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement. Any such payments made from the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Vested Options shall be made to the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the then former holders of Vested Options), and the Surviving Corporation shall use the funds received from the Escrow Agreement to promptly make the applicable payments to the then former holders of Vested Options, net of applicable withholding taxes, if any. No payments shall be made by the Parent, Newco, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any holder of Options which are unvested as of the Effective Time. For purposes of clarification, under this Section 2.13(a) the holder of the Warrant shall be treated as a holder of Vested Options, and, in    ##### 

  

 

connection with the Merger, the Warrant shall not be exercised, but shall be
converted solely into the right to receive the consideration contemplated
by this Section 2.13(a).    

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take the actions necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.13, including without limitation pursuant to (i) the terms of the Option Plan, including Section 5.5 thereof, (ii) the terms of the Warrant, and (iii) the terms of the Director Stock and Option Agreements, including Section 8 thereof.   

 (c) The Company shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to cause the Option Plan to terminate as of the Effective Time, and to ensure that no holder of Options issued pursuant to the Option Plan or any participant in the Option Plan shall have any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary.   

 Section 2.14 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Whiteford, Taylor and Preston L.L.P., Seven Saint Paul Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202, at 10:00 A.M. on the Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or on such date and time as the Company and Newco shall mutually agree. The time and date of the Closing is herein called the "Closing Date".   

 Section 2.15 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be made under the Escrow Agreement) if such withholding is required by law and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from any stockholder of the Company and any other recipient of any payment hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the applicable stockholder of the Company or other recipient of payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

The Companys entering into this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not trigger a release condition of any agreement with a third party for the release of such source code from escrow. For the sake of clarity, this Section 3.14(e) shall not apply to Customer Deliverables first produced by the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Governmental Authority (whether directly or pursuant to a subcontract) and that are not described in Schedule 3.20(c).

Deliverables as they existed on the Effective Date, could reasonably
be expected to ascertain the identity of such product with specificity
after reasonable inquiry. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14, no portion of

contemplated by the foregoing sentence).    

 (g) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14: (i) the Internal Systems to the extent developed by the Company ("Company-Developed Internal Systems") and the standard, latest version of the Customer Deliverables are free from significant defects or programming errors and conform in all material respects to the written documentation and specifications therefor; and (ii) the Internal Systems other than the Company-Developed Internal Systems are free from significant defects or programming errors and conform in all material respects to the written documentation and specifications therefor, unless such defect, error or nonconformity would not materially and adversely affect the ongoing business of the Company.

Following delivery of the Audited Financial Statements to the Parent, the Company will make available to the Parent and its representatives the financial records (including the work papers of the Companys independent accountants) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   

 Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The timing and content of the initial announcement of this Agreement or the Merger to the financial community, government agencies, employees or the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in advance by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and shall provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment upon, all announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement or the Merger to the financial community, government agencies, employees or the general public; provided that each party hereto may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in connection with any requirement of law or regulation, it being understood and agreed that each party shall promptly provide the other parties hereto with copies of any such announcement.   

 Section 5.7 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall not take, nor will the Company permit any of its respective affiliates,    ##### 

  

 

representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or
other agents to take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter into
any agreement with any person (other than Parent, Newco and/or their
affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Companys equity securities
or any merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction involving
the Company (other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business). The
Company hereby agrees to request of each potential acquirer of the Company to
which information, documents or other materials were provided within the six
months prior to the date hereof that such potential acquirer promptly after
such request either (a) return to the Company all such information, documents
and other materials and all copies thereof, or (b) destroy (such destruction
to be certified in writing to the Company by such potential acquirer) all
such information, documents and other materials and all copies
thereof.    

 Section 5.8 _Employee Benefit Plans._  (a) Except as set forth on Exhibit 5.8, on, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the Closing Date, the Parent will cause the Companys employees that become employees of the Parent or its Affiliates after the Effective Time, to be eligible for a group medical plan and other employee benefit plans, programs or policies, which are the same as, or comparable to, those maintained for similarly situated employees of the Parent.   

 (b) Parent and Newco hereby agree that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall grant or cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to grant all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries credit for any service with the Company and its Subsidiaries earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility, vesting and, except with respect to qualified retirement plans, benefit accrual purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the "Parent Plans"). In addition, Parent and Newco hereby agree that Parent shall or shall cause (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent Plan, provided that such expenses are documented to the reasonable satisfaction of the Parent.   

 Section 5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The articles of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent governing instruments) of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification of directors and officers of the respective entities than are set forth in the articles of amendment and restatement and by-laws of the respective entities as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the respective entities. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to renew, to the extent such renewals are available, the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy for an additional two years after the    ##### 

  

 

expiration of the current policy period and, if the insurer terminates such
policy during such time, to purchase any extended reporting period or "tail"
coverage available under such policy; provided, however, that in no event
shall Parent and the Surviving Corporation be required to pay more than an
aggregate of $50,000 to fulfill their obligations under this Section
5.9.    

 Section 5.10 _Newco_. The Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Newco to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets (other than a de minimis amount of cash paid to Newco for the issuance of its stock to the Parent).   

 Section 5.11 _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Parent a notice that the Common Stock and Preferred Stock are not "U.S. real property interests" in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code. If Parent does not receive the notice described above on or before the Closing Date, Parent, Newco, the Company, or the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding tax under Section 1445 of the Code.   

 Section 5.12 _Letters of Credit_. The Parent acknowledges that the Company has an obligation under the lease for its corporate headquarters in Towson, Maryland to provide the landlord with one or more letters of credit (collectively, the "Lease Letter of Credit") and that the Lease Letter of Credit currently provided by the Company to such landlord has been issued under the Credit Agreement. The Parent hereby agrees that on or prior to the Closing, Parent will either (i) issue a back up letter of credit to Bank of America in a manner such that, assuming all other amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement have been paid in full, Bank of America will release the Liens it has on the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets in a manner that satisfies the condition regarding the release of Liens under the Credit Agreement set forth in Section 6.2(e), (ii) issue a replacement Lease Letter of Credit to such landlord in exchange for the current Lease Letter of Credit or (iii) take such actions with such landlord (such as signing a guaranty) which results in such landlord releasing the Lease Letter of Credit; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not contact such landlord without first consulting with the Company.   

 Section 5.13 _280G Covenant_    

 Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit to a stockholder vote the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive acceleration of vesting of any stock options by virtue of action by the Board of Directors after the date hereof and that otherwise would not be vested by their terms or pursuant to the terms of existing employment agreements as of immediately after the Closing, in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements for the small business exemption of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and any regulations (including proposed regulations) promulgated thereunder. Consistent with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) and the regulations, such vote shall establish the "disqualified individuals" right to such accelerated vesting.    #####

 (b) Indemnification of Third Party Actions for the Benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees. The obligations and liabilities with respect to a Third Party Action for which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII will be subject to the following terms and conditions:    

 (i) Cornerstone will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend against and to direct the defense of any such Third Party Action and any related Legal Proceeding at the sole cost and expense of Cornerstone (which costs and expenses shall be on behalf of, and reimbursable on a pro rata basis by, the Company Securityholders) and with counsel of Cornerstones choosing (subject to the approval of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Parent and Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof. Parent may participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing, provided that the Parent will not, following written notice of Cornerstones election to defend against and direct the defense of any such Third Party Action, be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Legal Proceeding incurred by Parent or any of its affiliates in connection with the defense of such Legal Proceeding. If Cornerstone assumes the defense of a Third Party Action, no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by Cornerstone without the written consent of the Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their respective affiliates, and (y) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full from the Escrow Account. The Buyer Indemnitees will have no right to indemnification from the Escrow Account in connection with any compromise or settlement of a Third Party Action effected without Cornerstones written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cornerstone will not have the right to defend against or to direct the defense of any such Third Party Action and any related Legal Proceeding (and the Parent shall expressly have such right) if: (X) Cornerstone or Cornerstone Equity Investors IV, L.P. is also a party to such Third Party Action and the Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the Buyer Indemnitees have available to them one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with those of Cornerstone or Cornerstone Equity Investors IV, L.P.; (Y) the amount of the claimed damages in the applicable Third Party Action is at least $1,000,000 greater than the amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnities are entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII or (Z) the Third Party Action involves any Governmental Authority as a party thereto, criminal liability, or any Third Party Action in which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer Indemnitees.    

 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.3(b)(i) of this Agreement, if Cornerstone fails or refuses to undertake the defense of such Third Party Action within 10 days after delivery of written notification to Cornerstone of the commencement of such Third Party Action or if Cornerstone later withdraws from such defense, the Parent will have the right to undertake the defense of such claim with counsel of its own choosing, with the costs and expenses of such defense to be paid for from the Escrow    ##### 

  

   

Account and with the Company Securityholders bound by any determination made
in such Third Party Action or any compromise or settlement effected by
Parent.    

 (iii) The Parent will have the right (including the selection of counsel, which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to Cornerstone) to defend against, direct the defense of, or, subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.3(b)(iii), settle any Third Party Action described in the last sentence of Section 8.3(b)(i) and any related Legal Proceeding. In connection with any such Third Party Action described in the last sentence of Section 8.3(b)(i), the Parent agrees (i) to keep Cornerstone reasonably informed of its defense and resolution of the Third Party Action, (ii) to report to Cornerstone in writing, at least monthly, as to the amount of Losses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred as of the date of such report, together with a good faith estimate of the amount of any additional Losses that the Parent expects may be incurred in the future based upon the status of such matters as of such date, and (iii) that it will make reasonable judgments with respect to incurring costs and expenses and other Losses (including the selection of outside counsel) in a similar matter and based on similar factors as it does for similar third party claims for which it has no right to indemnification under this Article VIII. No compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by the Parent without the written consent of Cornerstone (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the Parent has waived any and all right to indemnification against the Escrow Account in connection therewith.   

 (c) Indemnification of Third Party Actions for the Benefit of the Seller Indemnitees. The obligations and liabilities with respect to a Third Party Action for which any Seller Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII will be subject to the following terms and conditions:    

 (i) The Parent will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend against and to direct the defense of any such Third Party Action and any related Legal Proceeding at the Parents sole cost and expense and with counsel of Parents choosing (subject to the approval of Cornerstone, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Cornerstone will reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof. Cornerstone may participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing, provided that the Parent will not, following written notice of its election to defend against and direct the defense of any such Third Party Action, be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees under this Article VIII for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Legal Proceeding incurred by Cornerstone or any Company Securityholder in connection with the defense of such Legal Proceeding unless Parent is also a party to such Third Party Action and Cornerstone determines in good faith that the Company Securityholders have available to them one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with those of the Parent. If the Parent assumes the defense of a Third Party Action, no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by the Parent without the written consent of Cornerstone (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Company    ##### 

  

   

Securityholders, and (y) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Parent. The Parent will have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement of a Third Party Action effected
without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).    

 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.3(c)(i) of this Agreement, if the Parent fails or refuses to undertake the defense of such Third Party Action within 10 days after delivery of written notification to the Parent of the commencement of such Third Party Action or if the Parent later withdraws from such defense, Cornerstone will have the right to undertake the defense of such claim with counsel of its own choosing, with the Parent responsible for the costs and expenses of such defense and bound by any determination made in such Third Party Action or any compromise or settlement effected by Cornerstone.   

 (d) Cooperation. All of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.   

 (e) Claim Notice. In order to seek indemnification under this Article VIII, an Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Responsible Party.   

 (f) Response. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Responsible Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the Responsible Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case (x) if the Responsible Party is the Parent, then the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Parent to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer and (y) if the Responsible Party is Cornerstone, then Parent and Cornerstone shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Claimed Amount to the Parent), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case (xx) if the Responsible Party is the Parent, then the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Parent to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer and (yy) if the Responsible Party is Cornerstone, then Parent and Cornerstone shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Amount to the Parent), and/or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any or all of the Claimed Amount.

In connection with any such Dispute, if the Responsible Party is Cornerstone, then the Parent and Cornerstone shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, final non-appealable judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Funds shall be disbursed    ##### 

  

 

to the Parent and/or the Company Securityholders (which notice shall be
consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

 (a) The rights of the Buyer Indemnities to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2(a) are subject to the following limitations:    

 (i) the amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of any amounts recovered by Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates under insurance policies with respect to such Losses;    

 (ii) the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2(a) until the total amount which the Buyer Indemnitees would recover under clause (i) of Section 8.2(a) (as limited by the provisions of clause (i) of this Section 8.4(a)), but for this clause (ii), exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold") and then only for the excess over the Threshold; provided, however, that, subject to clause (iii) of this Section 8.4(a), the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover all Losses (without regard to the Threshold) as a result of any breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10 of this Agreement;    

 (iii) in the aggregate, the Buyer Indemnitees (x) will be entitled to recover no more than $16,000,000 (the "Cap") and (y) pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with any certificate delivered in connection herewith, will not be entitled to recover Losses from any source other than the Escrow Account; and    

 (iv) the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 8.2(a) until the total amount which the Buyer Indemnitees would recover under clause (iii) of Section 8.2(a) (as limited by the provisions of clause (i) of this Section 8.4(a)), but for this clause (iv), exceeds Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the "Section 8.2(a)(iii) Threshold") and then only for the excess over the Section 8.2(a)(iii) Threshold.  

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the
Closing, on the date that the amount of cash in the Escrow Account is reduced
to zero, the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification under this Article VIII.    

 (b) The rights of the Seller Indemnities to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.2(b) are subject to the following limitations:    

 (i) the Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2(b) until the total amount which the Seller Indemnitees would recover under clause (i) of Section 8.2(b), but for this clause (i), exceeds the Threshold and then only for the excess over the Threshold; and    

 (ii) in the aggregate, the Seller Indemnitees will be entitled to recover no more than the Cap.    ##### 

  

  

 (c) No Company Securityholder shall have any right of contribution against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any amounts payable as a result of the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8.2(a) hereof.   

 Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy._  (a) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, other than for equitable remedies and fraud, (i) indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article VIII and Article VIIIA shall be the exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto and (ii) making a claim for a proper distribution from the Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent for any Loss, Losses or other amounts (including, without limitation, any relating to environmental, health or safety matters or Tax matters) arising under the indemnification obligations set forth herein, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 Section 8.6 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments._   Any payments made to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article VIII shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.   

 Section 8.7 _Provisions Controlling Tax Matters._   The provisions of this Article VIII shall not apply to matters involving Taxes, which shall be governed by Article VIIIA.   

 Section 8.8 _Broadview Engagement Letter._  Parent and Cornerstone agree that in connection with any payments from the Escrow Account to the Company Securityholders, Parent and Cornerstone will direct the Escrow Agent to make an appropriate payment to Broadview International LLC to the extent such payment is required pursuant to the terms of the Broadview Engagement Letter.   

ARTICLE VIIIA  Tax Matters    

 Section 8.1A _Tax Indemnification._    

 The Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow for the amount of any Loss resulting from, relating to, or constituting (x) a breach of any representation contained in Section 3.10 of this Agreement, (y) the failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Article VIIIA and Section 5.13, and (z) without duplication, the following Taxes, to the extent not included in the calculation of the Net Income Tax Adjustment or Net Working Capital:   

 (a) Any Taxes for any Taxable period ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 8.2A of this Agreement to end) on or before the Closing Date due and payable by the Company or any Subsidiary; and   

 (b) Any Taxes for any Taxable period ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 8.2A of this Agreement to end) on or before the Closing Date for which the Company has any liability as a transferee or successor, or pursuant to any contractual obligation or otherwise.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.2A _Allocation of Certain Taxes._    

 (a) The Parent and Company agree that if the Company is permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Parent and the Company shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable period.   

 (b) Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date shall be paid by the Parent or its Affiliates. In accordance with Section 8.1A, the Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow in an amount equal to the portion of any such Taxes allocable to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date which shall be deemed to equal (i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, the amount which would be payable if the Taxable year ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For purposes of the provisions of Section 8.1A of this Agreement, each portion of such period shall be deemed to be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period).   

 Section 8.3A _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._    

 (a) The Parent shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company that are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) after the Closing Date. The Parent shall make or cause to be made all payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns. The Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow for all amounts due under this Section 8.3A for which the Parent is entitled (as determined under Section 8.2A hereof) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date such amounts are due and payable to the Governmental Authority and the Parent shall sign and timely file, or cause to be signed and timely filed, all such Returns together with the amount of Tax shown thereon to be due. If the amount of such Tax liability for which the Parent is entitled to be reimbursed is the subject of a dispute pursuant to this Section 8.3A on the due date, then the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Parent the amount of such Tax that is not in dispute and will pay the Parent that portion of any additional amount owed, including any interest or penalties thereon when such amount is finally resolved and the Parent shall be required to pay to the relevant Governmental Authority only such amount of Taxes as are not in dispute.   

 (b) Any Tax Return required to be prepared and filed after the Closing Date for taxable periods (or portions thereof) before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice to the extent permitted under applicable law. The Parent shall permit Cornerstone to review and comment on any Income Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing to the extent that the Parent may claim reimbursement from the Escrow with respect to any item thereon. The Parent shall provide such Income Tax Returns to Cornerstone 45 days before such Income Tax Returns are required to be filed (together with such additional information regarding such Income Tax Returns as may reasonably be requested by Cornerstone). Cornerstone may comment on such Income Tax Returns within 20 days following    ##### 

  

 

receipt of the returns. The failure of Cornerstone to propose any changes to
such Income Tax Returns within such 20 day period shall be deemed to
constitute Cornerstones approval thereof. If Cornerstone provides comments
within the 20 day period, the Parent (i) shall make such revisions as are
requested by Cornerstone to the extent the Parent, in its discretion,
determines that such change is permitted by applicable law and (ii) notify
Cornerstone within 5 days following receipt of the Cornerstones comments of
the revisions which it disputes. Such notice shall constitute a Response for
purposes of Section 8.7A and the procedures therein shall apply. The Parent
shall cause a copy of any other Tax Return required to be prepared and filed
after the Closing Date that includes a taxable period (or portion thereof)
before the Closing Date and as to which the Parent will claim reimbursement
from the Escrow with respect to any item thereon to be sent to Cornerstone
(to the extent practicable) at least five days before filing or such earlier
date as preparation of such Tax return may reasonably allow. In the event
Cornerstone wishes to dispute its liability for a portion or all of such Tax
reported on such Tax return, it shall send a notice to the Parent within ten
days after receipt of the Tax Return. Such notice shall constitute a Response
for purposes of Section 8.7A and the procedures therein shall apply.    

 (c) The Parent and Cornerstone agree to promptly notify the Escrow Agent in writing to release to the Parent any amounts for which the Parent is authorized to be reimbursed from the Escrow hereunder.   

 Section 8.4A _Audits, Assessments, Etc._    

 Whenever any Governmental Authority sends a notice of an audit, initiates an examination of the Company or any Subsidiary, or otherwise asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or disputes the amount of Taxes for which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow, the Parent shall promptly inform Cornerstone. The failure of the Parent to notify Cornerstone promptly shall not affect the rights of the Parent Indemnitees to reimbursement from the Escrow except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such failure. The Parent shall have the exclusive right to control any resulting proceedings. Cornerstone shall have the right to participate at its own expense, in such proceeding, or portion thereof, only to the extent such proceeding, or portion thereof, or determination, or portion thereof, affects the amount of Taxes for which Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow under this Agreement, and the Parent may settle any such proceeding or determination, or portion thereof, to the extent such proceeding or determination affects such amount of Taxes for which Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow under this Agreement only with the prior written consent of Cornerstone, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

 Section 8.5A _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements._    

 Any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or Tax distribution agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Company shall, except as provided in Exhibit 8.5A, be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Parent, the Company, and their Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.6A _Indemnification Claims._    

 (a) Scope of Article VIIIA. Any claim relating to a breach of obligations under this Article VIIIA shall be pursued in accordance with the procedures for indemnification claims set forth in this Article VIIIA, and shall not otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in Article VIII other than Sections 8.1, 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.6 thereof. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the terms of Article VIII and this Article VIIIA with respect to the allocation of responsibility between the Company, the Company Securityholders and the Parent for Taxes relating to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries, the provisions of this Article VIIIA shall govern.   

 (b) Claim Procedure. For purposes of clarification, (i) claims for a breach of an obligation under this Article VIIIA may be made by a Buyer Indemnitee at any time on or before the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) in order to seek indemnification under this Article VIIIA, a Buyer Indemnitee shall deliver a Claim Notice to Cornerstone and a copy of the Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent in the form prescribed by the Escrow Agreement, (iii) if funds have been retained in Escrow after the Termination Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Claim Notice, upon resolution of the matter the Parent and Cornerstone shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such retained funds pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement in accordance with the resolution of the matter, and (iv) within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, Cornerstone shall deliver to the Parent a Response in which Cornerstone shall: (1) agree that the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount in which case Cornerstone and the Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by Cornerstone and the Parent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Claimed Amount (or, if lesser, the remaining Escrow Fund) to the Buyer Indemnitee, (2) agree that the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount in which case Cornerstone and the Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by Cornerstone and the Parent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed Amount (or, if lesser, the remaining Escrow Fund) to the Buyer Indemnitee, or (3) dispute that the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount.   

 Section 8.7A _Dispute Resolution_.   

 During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a Dispute, the Parent and Cornerstone shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute. If, at the end of the 30-day period, the Parent and Cornerstone have not resolved such Dispute, the Parent and Cornerstone shall refer the Dispute for determination to the Accounting Firm which shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator, and the parties will be reasonably available and work diligently to facilitate the Accounting Firm to render a determination within a 20-day period immediately following the referral to them. A determination by the Accounting Firm with respect to any item of Dispute submitted to it will be binding on the Parent, Cornerstone and the Company Securityholders solely for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of reimbursement from the Escrow Funds.    ##### 

  

  

 The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm with respect to each Dispute shall be borne as follows:   

 (i) If the Accounting Firm resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of Parents position, then all fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid from the Escrow.   

 (ii) If the Accounting Firm resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of Cornerstones position, Parent will be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm.   

 (iii) If the Accounting Firm neither resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of the Parents position nor resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of Cornerstones position, then the portion of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm to be paid from Escrow shall be the amount of fees that bear the same ratio to the total amount of fees as the portion of the Disputed amount determined in favor of Parent bears to the total Tax amount in Dispute and Parent shall pay the remaining fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm.   

 Section 8.8A _Limitations_.   

 The rights of the Buyer Indemnitees under this Article VIIIA shall be limited to the Escrow Fund. Any such payment hereunder shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the limitations under Section 8.4(a)(ii) (it being understood that, subject to the limitation of Section 8.4(a)(iii), the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover all Losses under this Article VIIIA (without regard to the Threshold)). Neither Cornerstone nor any Company Securityholder shall have any right of contribution against the Company with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow for a Tax liability for Tax periods ended before the Closing Date if such liability results from the Company (or the Parent), after the Closing, taking an action (including filing or amending a Tax return) with the appropriate Tax authority with respect to such prior Tax period without first being contacted by such Tax authority; provided, however, that the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow for a Tax liability for Tax periods (or portions thereof) ended before the Closing Date if such liability results from (i) the filing of any Tax returns for periods ending after the Closing Date and the filing with, or furnishing to, the appropriate Tax authority of registrations or related documents or requested information necessary or appropriate for compliance with the Tax laws for such periods, (ii) filing or amending returns or furnishing documents or information for any Tax period in response to or otherwise following contact initiated by a Tax authority, (iii) any filing made for the purpose of carrying back losses incurred after the Closing Date to prior periods, or (iv) any filing reporting the occurrence of the Merger.   

 ARTICLE IX-Representative of the Holders of Company Equity Securities Section 9.1 _Authorization of Representative._    

 (a) Cornerstone is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act as a representative, for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock and Vested Options (such    ##### 

  

 

Common Stock and Vested Options, collectively, the "Company Equity
Securities"), as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of
each holder of Company Equity Securities, in connection with and
to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which shall include the power and
authority:     

 (i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or changes therein as to which Cornerstone, in its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or modifications thereto as Cornerstone, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable;    

 (ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as Cornerstone, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;    

 (iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the holders of Company Equity Securities (including Cornerstone, in its capacity as a stockholder in the Company) and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of Cornerstone arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein or the transactions provided for herein or therein (including, without limitation, in connection with any and all claims for indemnification brought under Article VIII or Article VIIIA hereof), and to take any and all actions which Cornerstone believes are necessary or appropriate under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on behalf of the holders of Company Equity Securities, including, without limitation, asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim") against Parent, Newco and/or Surviving Corporation, defending any Third Party Claims or Claims by the Purchaser Indemnitees, consenting to, compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent, Surviving Corporation and their respective representatives regarding such Claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute any action, proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other person, or by any federal, state or local Governmental Authority against Cornerstone and/or any of the holders of Company Equity Securities and/or the Escrow Funds, and receive process on behalf of any or all holders of Company Equity Securities in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as Cornerstone shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation; (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as Cornerstone may deem advisable or necessary; (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under the Escrow Agreement; and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it being understood that Cornerstone shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions;    ##### 

  

   

 (iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the holders of Company Equity Securities or any of them and/or Cornerstone arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that no such failure to act on the part of Cornerstone, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by Cornerstone or by the holders of Company Equity Securities unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by Cornerstone; and    

 (v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that Cornerstone, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith.   

 (b) Cornerstone shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services under this Article IX, but shall be entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as representative. In connection with the foregoing, at the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall transfer $250,000 (the "Expense Funds") to Cornerstone, to be used by Cornerstone to pay expenses incurred by Cornerstone in its capacity as representative. Once Cornerstone determines, in its sole discretion, that it will not incur any additional expenses in its capacity as representative, then it will appropriately distribute the remaining unused Expense Funds, if any, to the Company Securityholders. In connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon Cornerstone hereunder (i) Cornerstone shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any holders of Company Equity Securities by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful misconduct, and (ii) Cornerstone shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of Cornerstone pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject Cornerstone to liability to any holders of Company Equity Securities. Each holder of Company Equity Securities shall indemnify, pro rata based upon such holders share (excluding all Dissenting Common Shares) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (on a fully-diluted basis excluding all unvested Options as of the Effective Time and excluding all Dissenting Common Shares), Cornerstone against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of Cornerstone hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or otherwise. The foregoing    ##### 

  

  

indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding
which finally adjudicates the liability of Cornerstone hereunder for its
willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon
written notice from Cornerstone to the holders of Company Equity Securities
as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such
indemnification amount, each holder of Company Equity Securities shall
promptly deliver to Cornerstone full payment of his or her ratable share of
the amount of such deficiency based upon such holders share (excluding all
Dissenting Common Shares) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Closing (on a fully-diluted basis excluding
all unvested Options as of the Effective Time and excluding all Dissenting
Common Shares).   

 (c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to Cornerstone under this Agreement shall survive the Effective Date and/or any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.   

 (d) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by Cornerstone pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the holders of Company Equity Securities.   

 (e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any holder of Company Equity Securities; and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the Merger.   

 (f) Should Cornerstone resign or be unable to serve, Cornerstone shall appoint a single substitute agent to take on the responsibility of the representative hereunder, whose appointment shall be effective on the date of Cornerstones resignation or incapacity.

 Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Company and Parent and Newco acknowledge that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).   

 Section 10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 Section 10.14 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or parties exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.
