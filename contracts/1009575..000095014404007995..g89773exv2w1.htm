<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Indemnification of Third Party Actions for the Benefit of the Buyer
Indemnitees. The obligations and liabilities with respect to a Third Party
Action for which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Article&nbsp;VIII will be subject to the following terms and conditions:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Cornerstone will have the right, but not the obligation, to
defend against and to direct the defense of any such Third Party Action
and any related Legal Proceeding at the sole cost and expense of
Cornerstone (which costs and expenses shall be on behalf of, and
reimbursable on a pro rata basis by, the Company Securityholders) and
with counsel of Cornerstone&#146;s choosing (subject to the approval of
Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Parent
and Surviving Corporation will reasonably cooperate in the defense
thereof. Parent may participate in such defense with counsel of its own
choosing, provided that the Parent will not, following written notice of
Cornerstone&#146;s election to defend against and direct the defense of any
such Third Party Action, be entitled to indemnification under this
Article&nbsp;VIII for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Legal Proceeding incurred by Parent or any
of its affiliates in connection with the defense of such Legal
Proceeding. If Cornerstone assumes the defense of a Third Party Action,
no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of liability in
connection with, such claims may be effected by Cornerstone without the
written consent of the Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless (x)&nbsp;there is no finding or admission of any
violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or their respective affiliates, and (y)&nbsp;the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full from the Escrow
Account. The Buyer Indemnitees will have no right to indemnification
from the Escrow Account in connection with any compromise or settlement
of a Third Party Action effected without Cornerstone&#146;s written consent
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cornerstone will not have the right to
defend against or to direct the defense of any such Third Party Action
and any related Legal Proceeding (and the Parent shall expressly have
such right) if: (X)&nbsp;Cornerstone or Cornerstone Equity Investors IV, L.P.
is also a party to such Third Party Action and the Parent reasonably
determines in good faith that the Buyer Indemnitees have available to
them one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with
those of Cornerstone or Cornerstone Equity Investors IV, L.P.; (Y)&nbsp;the
amount of the claimed damages in the applicable Third Party Action is at
least $1,000,000 greater than the amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnities are entitled to indemnification under this Article&nbsp;VIII or
(Z)&nbsp;the Third Party Action involves any Governmental Authority as a party
thereto, criminal liability, or any Third Party Action in which equitable
relief is sought against the Buyer Indemnitees.

Agreement, if Cornerstone fails or refuses to undertake the defense of
such Third Party Action within 10&nbsp;days after delivery of written
notification to Cornerstone of the commencement of such Third Party
Action or if Cornerstone later withdraws from such defense, the Parent
will have the right to undertake the defense of such claim with counsel
of its own choosing, with the costs and expenses of such defense to be
paid for from the Escrow

defend against, direct the defense of, or, subject to the last sentence
of this Section&nbsp;8.3(b)(iii), settle any Third Party Action described in
the last sentence of Section&nbsp;8.3(b)(i) and any related Legal Proceeding.
In connection with any such Third Party Action described in the last
sentence of Section&nbsp;8.3(b)(i), the Parent agrees (i)&nbsp;to keep Cornerstone
reasonably informed of its defense and resolution of the Third Party
Action, (ii)&nbsp;to report to Cornerstone in writing, at least monthly, as to
the amount of Losses (including attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) incurred as
of the date of such report, together with a good faith estimate of the
amount of any additional Losses that the Parent expects may be incurred
in the future based upon the status of such matters as of such date, and
(iii)&nbsp;that it will make reasonable judgments with respect to incurring
costs and expenses and other Losses (including the selection of outside
counsel) in a similar matter and based on similar factors as it does for
similar third party claims for which it has no right to indemnification
under this Article&nbsp;VIII. No compromise, discharge or settlement of, or
admission of liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by
the Parent without the written consent of Cornerstone (which consent will

and with counsel of Parent&#146;s choosing (subject to the approval of
Cornerstone, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
Cornerstone will reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof.
Cornerstone may participate in such defense with counsel of its own
choosing, provided that the Parent will not, following written notice of
its election to defend against and direct the defense of any such Third
Party Action, be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees under this Article&nbsp;VIII
for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Legal Proceeding incurred by Cornerstone or any Company
Securityholder in connection with the defense of such Legal Proceeding
unless Parent is also a party to such Third Party Action and Cornerstone
determines in good faith that the Company Securityholders have available
to them one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with
those of the Parent. If the Parent assumes the defense of a Third Party
Action, no compromise, discharge or settlement of, or admission of
liability in connection with, such claims may be effected by the Parent
without the written consent of Cornerstone (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (x)&nbsp;there is no finding or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.6A </B><B><I>Indemnification Claims.</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Scope of Article&nbsp;VIIIA. Any claim relating to a breach of obligations
under this Article&nbsp;VIIIA shall be pursued in accordance with the procedures for
indemnification claims set forth in this Article&nbsp;VIIIA, and shall not otherwise
be subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in Article&nbsp;VIII other than
Sections&nbsp;8.1, 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.6 thereof. To the extent there is any
inconsistency between the terms of Article&nbsp;VIII and this Article&nbsp;VIIIA with
respect to the allocation of responsibility between the Company, the Company
Securityholders and the Parent for Taxes relating to the business of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;VIIIA shall
govern.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Claim Procedure. For purposes of clarification, (i)&nbsp;claims for a
breach of an obligation under this Article&nbsp;VIIIA may be made by a Buyer
Indemnitee at any time on or before the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
(ii)&nbsp;in order to seek indemnification under this Article&nbsp;VIIIA, a Buyer
Indemnitee shall deliver a Claim Notice to Cornerstone and a copy of the Claim
Notice to the Escrow Agent in the form prescribed by the Escrow Agreement,
(iii)&nbsp;if funds have been retained in Escrow after the Termination Date (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Claim Notice, upon
resolution of the matter the Parent and Cornerstone shall promptly deliver to
the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse such retained funds pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement in accordance with the resolution of the matter, and (iv)
within 20&nbsp;days after delivery of a Claim Notice, Cornerstone shall deliver to
the Parent a Response in which Cornerstone shall: (1)&nbsp;agree that the Buyer
Indemnitee is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount in which case
Cornerstone and the Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days
following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by
Cornerstone and the Parent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Claimed
Amount (or, if lesser, the remaining Escrow Fund) to the Buyer Indemnitee, (2)
agree that the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount in
which case Cornerstone and the Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within
three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by
Cornerstone and the Parent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed
Amount (or, if lesser, the remaining Escrow Fund) to the Buyer Indemnitee, or
(3)&nbsp;dispute that the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.7A </B><B><I>Dispute Resolution</I></B>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a Dispute, the Parent and Cornerstone shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the Dispute. If, at the end of the 30-day period, the Parent and
Cornerstone have not resolved such Dispute, the Parent and Cornerstone shall
refer the Dispute for determination to the Accounting Firm which shall act as
an expert, not as an arbitrator, and the parties will be reasonably available
and work diligently to facilitate the Accounting Firm to render a determination
within a 20-day period immediately following the referral to them. A
determination by the Accounting Firm with respect to any item of Dispute
submitted to it will be binding on the Parent, Cornerstone and the Company
Securityholders solely for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of
reimbursement from the Escrow Funds.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm with respect to each Dispute
shall be borne as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;If the Accounting Firm resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of
Parent&#146;s position, then all fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
paid from the Escrow.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;If the Accounting Firm resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of
Cornerstone&#146;s position, Parent will be responsible for all of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;If the Accounting Firm neither resolves the Dispute entirely in
favor of the Parent&#146;s position nor resolves the Dispute entirely in favor of
Cornerstone&#146;s position, then the portion of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm to be paid from Escrow shall be the amount of fees that bear
the same ratio to the total amount of fees as the portion of the Disputed
amount determined in favor of Parent bears to the total Tax amount in Dispute
and Parent shall pay the remaining fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.8A </B><B><I>Limitations</I></B>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights of the Buyer Indemnitees under this Article&nbsp;VIIIA shall be
limited to the Escrow Fund. Any such payment hereunder shall not be taken into
account for purposes of determining the limitations under Section&nbsp;8.4(a)(ii)
(it being understood that, subject to the limitation of Section&nbsp;8.4(a)(iii),
the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover all Losses under this Article
VIIIA (without regard to the Threshold)). Neither Cornerstone nor any Company
Securityholder shall have any right of contribution against the Company with
respect to any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements. No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to be
reimbursed from the Escrow for a Tax liability for Tax periods ended before the
Closing Date if such liability results from the Company (or the Parent), after
the Closing, taking an action (including filing or amending a Tax return) with
the appropriate Tax authority with respect to such prior Tax period without
first being contacted by such Tax authority; provided, however, that the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow for a Tax
liability for Tax periods (or portions thereof) ended before the Closing Date
if such liability results from (i)&nbsp;the filing of any Tax returns for periods
ending after the Closing Date and the filing with, or furnishing to, the
appropriate Tax authority of registrations or related documents or requested
information necessary or appropriate for compliance with the Tax laws for such
periods, (ii)&nbsp;filing or amending returns or furnishing documents or information
for any Tax period in response to or otherwise following contact initiated by a
Tax authority, (iii)&nbsp;any filing made for the purpose of carrying back losses
incurred after the Closing Date to prior periods, or (iv)&nbsp;any filing reporting
the occurrence of the Merger.

Surviving Corporation shall transfer $250,000 (the &#147;Expense Funds&#148;) to

in its capacity as representative. Once Cornerstone determines, in its sole
