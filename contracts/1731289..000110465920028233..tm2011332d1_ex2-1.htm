Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of Company Common Stock and holder of
Company Preferred Stock entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_: a letter of transmittal,

(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and shall specify (i) that delivery shall be

the Company's transfer agent, eShares, Inc. DBA Carta, Inc. (each, a  "
_Carta Cancellation_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal. Within

surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by such holder for
cancellation (or a Carta Cancellation), together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore, and VectoIQ shall cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver, the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions
of  _Section 3.01_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_, each
Certificate entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.01 _shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of VectoIQ
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to the VectoIQ Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of VectoIQ Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_. Subject to the effect of
escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, VectoIQ shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing shares of VectoIQ Common Stock issued in exchange
therefore, without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within five (5)
Business Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of VectoIQ Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such shares of
VectoIQ Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock_. The Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to VectoIQ Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to VectoIQ, upon demand,
and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied
with this _Section 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to VectoIQ for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of VectoIQ free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, VectoIQ or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock for any such Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law in accordance with _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
VectoIQ shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or VectoIQ, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (or intended recipients of compensatory payments) in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or VectoIQ, as the case may be.

connection with the Transactions and (ii) the fees and expenses of any other

(b) No sooner than five (5) or later than two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, VectoIQ shall provide to the Company a written report
setting forth a list of all fees, expenses and disbursements incurred by or on

SECTION 3.05 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
and to the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of the Company who shall
have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and
who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant
to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such stockholders
shall have no right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration unless and
until such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his,
her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of
the Company who fails to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses his, her or its rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in _Section 3.01(b)_, of the Certificate or Certificates
that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (as the case may be).

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

  



  

(d) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of the Company or any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or to provide
funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any person other than a Company Subsidiary.

  



  

(e) (i) There are no commitments or agreements of any character to
which the Company is bound obligating the Company to accelerate the
vesting of any Company Share Award or Company Option as a result of the
proposed transactions herein, and (ii) all outstanding shares of the Company,
all outstanding Company Share Awards and Company Options, and all outstanding
shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been issued and
granted in compliance with (A) all applicable securities laws and other
applicable laws and (B) all pre-emptive rights and other requirements set

is a party.

  



  

(f) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company

the shares of the Company held by the stockholders of the Company, no shares
or other equity or voting interest of the Company, or options, warrants or

21

 



    



  

  

(h) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company

and granted in compliance with (A) applicable securities laws and other
applicable laws and (B) any pre-emptive rights and other similar requirements
set forth in applicable contracts to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party.

  



  

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company
Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of Article Fourth, Section 9.1 of the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation (the " _Conversion_ "). After the Conversion, all of the shares
of Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist, and each previous holder of Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect to such securities. Subject to and upon
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Conversion will have been
duly and validly authorized by all corporate action and all required approvals
and consents will have been obtained by the Company. By way of example, the
90,630,750 shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date
hereof would convert into 90,630,750 shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

SECTION 4.04 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to receiving the
Company Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the Company
Stockholder Approval, which the Written Consent shall satisfy, and the filing
and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by VectoIQ and
Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles (the " _Remedies Exceptions_ ").
The Company Board has approved this Agreement and the Transactions, and such
approvals are sufficient so that the restrictions on business combinations
set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL shall not apply to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Support Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any of the other
Transactions. To the knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover
statute is applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

SECTION 4.05 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does
not, and subject to receipt of the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and of the consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, filings and notifications contemplated
by _Section 4.05(b)_, the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
or any equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any United States or non-
United States statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive

the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any
material property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant
to, any Material Contract, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
which would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any United States federal, state, county or local or non-
United States government, governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal, or
judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i)
for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or
"blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger
notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

SECTION 4.06 _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all material franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to
own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to
have such Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with,
or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any Material Contract or
Company Permit, except, in each case, for any such conflicts, defaults,
breaches or violations that would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

obligated, whether under any Plan or otherwise, to pay separation,
severance, termination or similar benefits to any person directly as a result
of any Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, nor will any such

(b) With respect to each such insurance policy, except as would not
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) the policy is
legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to
the Remedies Exceptions) and, except for policies that have expired under

appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and (ii) where the

material obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 5.06 _Compliance_. Neither VectoIQ nor Merger Sub is or
has been in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law

instrument or obligation to which VectoIQ or Merger Sub is a party or by
which VectoIQ or Merger Sub or any property or asset of VectoIQ or Merger Sub
is bound, except, in each case, for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or
violations that would not have or reasonably be expected to have a VectoIQ
Material Adverse Effect. Each of VectoIQ and Merger Sub is in possession of
all material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,

they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each director and executive officer of VectoIQ has filed with
the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect to VectoIQ by
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations,
changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of VectoIQ as at the respective

information relating to VectoIQ and other material information required to be
disclosed by VectoIQ in the reports and other documents that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
VectoIQ's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting VectoIQ's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in VectoIQ's periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(f) VectoIQ maintains systems of internal control over financial
reporting that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies
and procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that VectoIQ
maintains records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in
all material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii)

financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and its board of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. VectoIQ has
delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if
unwritten, a summary thereof) by any representative of VectoIQ to VectoIQ's
independent auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls
and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that would adversely affect the ability of VectoIQ to record,
process, summarize and report financial data. VectoIQ has no knowledge of any
fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve
management or other employees or consultants who have or had a significant
role in the internal control over financial reporting of VectoIQ. Since

control over financial reporting.

Exchange Act) or director of VectoIQ. VectoIQ has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(h) Neither VectoIQ (including any employee thereof) nor VectoIQ's
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by VectoIQ, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
VectoIQ's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by VectoIQ
or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except: (A) to pay income
and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and
(B) upon the exercise of Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions

thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, VectoIQ shall cause
the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to
VectoIQ as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the
Trust Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; _provided_
, _however_ that the liabilities and obligations of VectoIQ due and owing or
incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due,

result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits. The Transactions shall not be the direct or indirect cause of any
amount paid or payable by the VectoIQ, Merger Sub or any affiliate being
classified as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code or
the imposition of any additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

making any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall include a summary of the
material terms and conditions of any material developments, discussions or

enable another person to form a basis for a Company Acquisition Proposal
without any breach by the Company of this _Section 7.05_ and (ii) the Company
may inform any person making a unsolicited proposal regarding a Company
Acquisition Proposal of the terms of this Section 7.05.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.05(a)_, prior to the receipt of
the Written Consent, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through
any Representative, may, subject to _Section 7.05(c)_, (i) participate in

that the Company Board reasonably believes in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Superior Proposal, and (ii) thereafter furnish to such
third party non-public information relating to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed Acceptable Confidentiality

the Company shall promptly provide to VectoIQ and Merger Sub any material
non-public information that is provided to any such person which has not
previously been provided to VectoIQ and Merger Sub.

  



  

  



  

(c) The Company shall notify VectoIQ promptly (but in no event
later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of any
Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, personnel, books or records of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any third party. In such
notice, the Company shall identify the third party making any such

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.05(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, change,
withdraw, withhold, amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to make,
change, withdraw, withhold, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to
VectoIQ or Merger Sub, the Company Board recommendation, or (B) adopt,
approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse
or recommend to the stockholders of the Company any Company
Acquisition Proposal or Company Superior Proposal, (ii) make any public

or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (iv) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Written Consent, but not after, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(i)_ to enter into (or permit any Company Subsidiary
to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal only if the Company Board has reasonably determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and legal
counsel, that (i) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such
action, (A) the Company promptly notifies VectoIQ, in writing, at least three
(3) Business Days (the " _Company Notice Period_ ") before making a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Company
Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to
take such action with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, which notice
shall (1) state expressly that the Company has received a Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a Company Superior
Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement, and (2) include a copy of the most current version of
the proposed agreement relating to such Company Superior Proposal (which
version shall be updated on a prompt basis, but in each case redacted as
necessary to exclude the identity of the third party making such Company
Superior Proposal), and a description of any financing commitments relating
thereto; (B) the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
and shall cause its and the Company Subsidiaries' Representatives to, during
the Company Notice Period, negotiate with VectoIQ in good faith in respect of
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Company Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal, if VectoIQ, in its discretion, proposes to make such
adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of
the Company Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a
Company Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Company
Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two
(2) Business Days remains in the Company Notice Period subsequent to the time
the Company notifies VectoIQ of any such material revision (it being
understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (C) following the end
of such Company Notice Period (as extended pursuant to the preceding clause
(B)) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside financial advisor and legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal after taking
into account any adjustments made by VectoIQ during the Company Notice Period
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company shall have complied with its obligations under this _Section
7.05(d)_ and if the Company Board terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(i)_ to enter into (or permit any Company Subsidiary to enter
into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, the Company pays to VectoIQ the
Termination Fee due under _Section 9.03(a)_.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to
obtaining the Written Consent, the Company Board determines in good faith, in
response to an Intervening Event, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Written Consent, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that the Company will not be entitled
to make, or agree or resolve to make, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless (i) the Company promptly notifies VectoIQ in writing, at least
three (3) Business Days (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") advising
VectoIQ that the Company Board proposes to take such action and containing
the material facts underlying the Company Board's determination that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and (ii) following the end of such
Intervening Event Notice Period (it being agreed that in the event after the
commencement of the Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material
development with respect to an Intervening Event, the Intervening Event
Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two
(2) Business Days remains in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent
to the time the Company notifies VectoIQ of any such material revision (it
being understood that there may be multiple extensions)), the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside financial advisors
and legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. If requested by VectoIQ, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and the Company
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period,
negotiate with VectoIQ in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

each of its subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the

applicable, under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any vacation or other paid time-
off program or policy) for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the
Effective Time with the Company or any Company Subsidiary;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In addition, VectoIQ shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under each of the
employee benefit plans established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries that cover the Continuing Employees or their
dependents, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, during the portion of the plan
year in which the Closing occurs, under those health and welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employee currently participates to be taken into
account under those health and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing
Employee participates subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year. Following the Closing, Surviving
Corporation will honor all accrued but unused vacation and other paid time off
of the Continuing Employees that existed immediately prior to the Closing.

reason of this Agreement, whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise,

properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any

may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,

that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have
been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 10.07_.

transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed

be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

REGISTRATION

  



  

Section 2.1 Demand Registration.

  



  

2.1.1 _Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, at any time and from time to
time on or after the Effective Time, (i) New Holders holding at least a
majority in interest of the then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities
held by all New Holders, (ii) Cowen Investments or (iii) Original Holders
holding at least a majority in interest of the then-outstanding number of
Registrable Securities held by all Original Holders (such New Holders, Cowen
Investments or such Original Holders, as the case may be, the "Demanding
Holders"), may make a written demand for Registration of all or part of their
Registrable Securities on Form S-3 ("Form S-3") (or, if Form S-3 is not
available to be used by the Company at such time, on Form S-1 or another
appropriate form permitting Registration of such Registrable Securities for
resale by such Demanding Holders), which written demand shall describe the
amount and type of securities to be included in such Registration and the
intended method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a "Demand
Registration"). The Company shall, within ten (10) days of the
Company's receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing, all other
Holders of Registrable Securities of such demand, and each Holder of
Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of
such Holder's Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration (each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such Holder's
Registrable Securities in such Registration, a "Demand Requesting Holder")
shall so notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days after the
receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the
Company of any such written notification from a Demand Requesting Holder(s)
to the Company, such Demand Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have
their Registrable Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable,
but not more than forty five (45) days immediately after the Company's receipt
of the Demand Registration, the Registration of all Registrable Securities
requested by the Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting Holders pursuant to
such Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the Company be
obligated to effect more than an aggregate of (i) three (3) Registrations
pursuant to a Demand Registration under this subsection 2.1.1 initiated by New
Holders or (ii) one (1) Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration under
this subsection 2.1.1 initiated by Original Holders;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Demand Registration
initiated by Cowen Investments which shall be governed by _Section 3.6_.

  



  

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _subsection 2.1.1 _above or any other part of this Agreement, a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a
Registration unless and until (i) the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
has been declared effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has
complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect
thereto; provided, further, that if, after such Registration Statement has
been declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered
with by any stop order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state
court or any other governmental agency the Registration Statement with respect
to such Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective,
unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be obligated or required to file another
Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has been
previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of
_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand
Registration that the offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the
right of such Demanding Holder or Demand Requesting Holder (if any) to
include its Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned
upon such Holder's participation in such Underwritten Offering and the
inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Offering to the extent provided herein. All such Holders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering
under this _subsection 2.1.3_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten
Offering by the majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating the
Demand Registration.

  



  

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding
Holders and the Demand Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar
amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the
Demand Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all
other Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell
and the Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held
by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Demand Requesting Holders (if any)
(pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Demand Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting
Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten Registration (such
proportion is referred to herein as  "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (i), Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires
to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), Common Stock or other
equity securities of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated
to register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.1.5 _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest
of the New Holders, a majority-in-interest of the Original Holders, or Cowen
Investments, as the case may be, in the case of a Registration under
subsection 2.1.1 initiated by the New Holders, the Original Holders, or Cowen
Investors, respectively, or a majority-in-interest of the Demand Requesting
Holders (if any), pursuant to a Registration under _subsection 2.2.1_ shall
have the right to withdraw from a Registration pursuant to such Demand
Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the
Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of their intention to
withdraw from such Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to the Registration of their
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration. If a majority-
in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand Registration or a
majority-in-interest of the Demand Requesting Holders (if any),
withdraws from a proposed offering pursuant to this _Section 2.1.5_, then
such registration shall not count as a Demand Registration provided for in
_Section 2.1_, and, if Cowen Investments withdraws, _Sections 2.1_ and _3.6_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its withdrawal under
this _subsection 2.1.5_ ; provided that if the Company pays such expenses
related to a Demand Registration initiated by Cowen Investments, such
registration shall count as a Demand Registration for purposes of _Section
3.6._

Section 2.2 Piggyback Registration.

  



  

2.2.1 _Piggyback Rights_. If, at any time on or after [__], the
Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act
with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into equity
securities, for its own account or for the account of stockholders of the
Company (or by the Company and by the stockholders of the Company including,
without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof), other than a Registration
Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee stock option or other
benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to
the Company's existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is
convertible into equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend
reinvestment plan, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed
filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable
but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date of such
Registration Statement, which notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of
securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of the Holders
of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale of such number
of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in writing within five
(5) days after receipt of such written notice (such Registration a "Piggyback
Registration"). The Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its
best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed
Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the
Holders pursuant to this subsection 2.2.1 to be included in a Piggyback
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of
the Company included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this
subsection 2.2.1 shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary
form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering by the
Company.

desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof, and (iii)
the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Securities, then:

  



   | (i)| If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account, the
Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection
2.2.1_ hereof, pro rata, based on the respective number of Registrable
Securities that each Holder has so requested, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B), Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of
other stockholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_, pro rata based on the
respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such
Underwritten Registration, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),

which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D)

arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of
Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback
Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the
Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its
intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good
faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

  



  

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of

Section 2.3 Resale Shelf Registration Rights

  



  

2.3.1 _Registration Statement on Form S-3 Covering Resale of
Registrable Securities_. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed with the Commission, no later than forty-five (45) days
following the date of this Agreement, a Registration Statement for an
offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act or any successor thereto registering the resale from time to
time by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities held by Holders (the
"Resale Shelf Registration Statement"). The Resale Shelf Registration
Statement shall be on Form S-3 (or, if Form S-3 is not available to be used
by the Company at such time, on Form S-1 or another appropriate form
permitting Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale). The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible after
filing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the filing
deadline (the "Effectiveness Deadline"); provided, that the Effectiveness
Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90) days after the filing deadline if
the Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives comments from, the
Commission. Once effective, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that
another Registration Statement is available, under the Securities Act at all
times until all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or have
ceased to be Registrable Securities. The Registration Statement filed with the
Commission pursuant to this _subsection 2.3.1_ shall contain a prospectus in
such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or
similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time
beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement (subject to
lock-up restrictions provided in Section 5.1 of this Agreement), and shall
provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, Holders.

  



  

   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.3.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company
shall notify the Holders in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement as soon as practicable, and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after the Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes
effective, and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of copies of
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments,
supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein (including each
preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any
documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner
described in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

  



  

2.3.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.3.1 above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with
the Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all the Registrable Securities. If any Resale
Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.3.1 is filed on Form
S-3 and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for
secondary sales, the Company shall promptly notify the Holders of such
ineligibility and use its best efforts to file a shelf registration on an
appropriate form as promptly as practicable to replace the shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 Shelf and have the such replacement Resale Shelf
Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable and to
cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available, for
the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all
such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that at any time the Company once again becomes eligible to
use Form S-3, the Company shall cause such replacement Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be amended, or shall file a new replacement
Resale Shelf Registration Statement, such that the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement is once again on Form S-3.

  



  

2.3.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in
this Section 2.3, in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of
the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule
415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a "New Registration Statement"), on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is
not then available to the Company for such registration statement, on such
other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a
secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or
New Registration Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the
Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-available written or
oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the Commission staff
(the "SEC Guidance"), including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly
Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number
of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular
Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the
Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the
registration of all or a greater number of Registrable Securities), unless
otherwise directed in writing by a holder as to its Registrable
Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such
Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the total
number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders, subject to a
determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be reduced first
based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the
event the Company amends the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a
New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the
Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to
the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to register
for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration

2.3.5 Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall
not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.2.

  



  

Section 2.4 Restrictions on Registration Rights. If (A) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to
the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection
2.1.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become effective;
(B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company
and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such
Registration would be materially detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the
near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right to
defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any 12 month period.

shall, as expeditiously as possible:

  



  

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable

the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to
keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the
intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or

Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement
to such Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in

the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such

jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any
action to which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation
in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar

issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order
should be issued;

3.1.9 at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any

3.1.10 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to
such Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the

effect, includes a Misstatement, and then to correct such Misstatement as set
forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

3.1.11 permit a representative of the Holders, the Underwriters, if
any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or
Underwriter to participate, at each such person's own expense, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause the Company's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or
Underwriters enter into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of
any such information;

  



  

3.1.12 obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Company's independent
registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration,

and reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the
participating Holders and such managing Underwriter;

  



  

3.1.13 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the
Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the Holders,
placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are
customarily included in such opinions and negative assurance letters, and
reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the
participating Holders;

  



  

   

 | 14| 
---|---|---

customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.15 make available to its security holders, as soon as
reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least
twelve (12) months beginning with the first day of the Company's first full

Commission);

  



  

3.1.16 if the Registration involves the Registration of
Registrable Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000, use
its reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

take such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

Section 3.2 Registration Expenses. The Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company.  It is acknowledged by the
Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating
to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters' commissions and
discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set
forth in the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

  



  

Section 3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings.
No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities
of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and (ii)
completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary
documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

  



  

Section 3.4 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until he, she or it has received copies
of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the
use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness
or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any
Registration at any time would require the Company to make an Adverse
Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of
financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond
the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of
such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time,
but in no event more than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the
Company to be necessary for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises
its rights under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend,
immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of
the Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or
offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Company shall immediately
notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised
its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

Section 3.5 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof
pursuant to _Sections 13(a)_ or _15(d)_ of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The
Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder
may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Holder to sell shares of Common Stock held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal
opinions.  Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such
Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

  



  

Section 3.6 Limitations on Registration Rights. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) Cowen Investments may not exercise its rights
under _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ hereunder after five (5) and seven (7)
years, respectively, from the effective date of the Company's registration
statement on Form S-1, File No. 333-224351, and (ii) Cowen Investments may
not exercise its rights under Section 2.2 more than one time. The Company
shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities
which is inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the Holders of
Registrable Securities in this Agreement and in the event of any conflict
between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of
this Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

Section 4.1 Indemnification

  



  

 4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and agents and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

   

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall
furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the
Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify
the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement
of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party)
and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot
be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

   

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Company's or such Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof
from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ ,
_4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this  _subsection
4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE VII

  

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHERS

  



  

(1) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good
faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_  or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
the person's conduct was unlawful.

  



  

(2) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure
a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or
suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

  



  

(3) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of
the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of
any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections (1) and (2) of this
Article VII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person
shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(4) Any indemnification under Sections (1) and (2) of this Article
VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in such Sections (1) and (2). Such determination shall be made,
with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such
determination, (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a
committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors,
even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if
such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion,
or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

(5) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or
director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation authorized in this Article VII.
Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and
officers or other employees and agents shall be so paid upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate.

  



  

(6) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by,
or granted pursuant to, the other sections of this Article VII shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, by-law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office.

  



  

(7) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of Section 145 of
the DGCL.

  



  

(8) For purposes of this Article VII, references to "the
Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued,
would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and
employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Article VII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such
person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(9) For purposes of this Article VII, references to "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves service by,
such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed
to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation" as referred to in this Article VII.

  



  

(10) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by,
or granted pursuant to, this Article VII shall, unless otherwise provided
when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., a corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, DOES HEREBY CERTIFY AS FOLLOWS:

  



  

1. The name of the Corporation is " _VectoIQ Acquisition Corp._ ". The original certificate of incorporation of the corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 23, 2018 (the " _Original Certificate_ ").

  



  

2. The Original Certificate was amended and restated on May 15, 2018 (the " _First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation_ ").

  



  

3. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this " _Second Amended and Restated Certificate_ "), which both amends and restates the provisions of the First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  



  

4. This Second Amended and Restated Certificate shall become effective on the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

  



  

5. Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the text of the First Amended and Restated Certificate is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

  



  

 _ARTICLE I_

  



  

The name of the Corporation is Nikola Corporation (the _" Corporation"_).

  



  

 _ARTICLE II_

  



  

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, Sussex County, Delaware, 19958, and
the name of the Corporation's registered agent at such address is Harvard

 _ARTICLE III_

  



  

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the _" DGCL_ _"_ ).

  



   

   



 



    



  

 _ARTICLE IV_

  



  

A. _Classes of Stock_. The total number of shares of all classes
of capital stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is seven
hundred fifty million (750,000,000), of which six hundred million
(600,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the
_" Common Stock_ _"_ ), and of which one hundred fifty million
(150,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share
(the " _Preferred Stock_ "). The number of authorized shares of Common Stock
or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, without a vote of
the holders of the Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of
any such Preferred Stock holders is required pursuant to the provisions
established by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the _" Board of
Directors"_) in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such
Preferred Stock, and if such holders of such Preferred Stock are so entitled
to vote thereon, then, except as may otherwise be set forth in the certificate
of incorporation of the Corporation, the only stockholder approval required
shall be the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the Common
Stock and the Preferred Stock so entitled to vote, voting together as a
single class.

  



  

B. _Preferred Stock_. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time
to time in one or more series, as determined by the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors is expressly authorized to provide for the issue, in one or
more series, of all or any of the remaining shares of Preferred Stock and, in
the resolution or resolutions providing for such issue, to establish for each
such series the number of its shares, the voting powers, full or limited, of
the shares of such series, or that such shares shall have no voting powers,
and the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or
other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof. The Board of Directors is also expressly
authorized (unless forbidden in the resolution or resolutions providing for
such issue) to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of
such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series subsequent
to the issuance of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any
such series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall
resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution
originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

  



  

C. _Common Stock_.

  



  

1. _Relative Rights of Preferred Stock and Common Stock._ All preferences, voting powers, relative, participating, optional or other special rights and privileges, and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the Common Stock are expressly made subject and subordinate to those that may be fixed with respect to any shares of the Preferred Stock.

  



  

2. _Voting Rights._ Except as otherwise required by law or the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in respect of each share of stock held by such holder of record on the books of the Corporation for the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

3. _Dividends. _ Subject to the preferential rights of the Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in property or in shares of capital stock.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

4. _Dissolution, Liquidation or Winding Up._ In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled, unless otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them respectively.

  



  

 _ARTICLE V_

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of
the State of Delaware:

  



  

A. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend
or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation, without any action on the part of
the stockholders, by the vote of at least a majority of the directors of the
Corporation then in office. In addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or the certificate
of incorporation of the Corporation, the bylaws may also be adopted, amended
or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting as one class.

  



  

B. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

  



  

C. The books of the Corporation may be kept at such place within
or without the State of Delaware as the bylaws of the Corporation may provide
or as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.

  



  

 _ARTICLE VI_

  



  

A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by
a Board of Directors. The authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall be fixed in the manner provided in the bylaws of the
Corporation. Other than for those directors elected by the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock, which shall be as provided for or fixed pursuant to
the provisions of Article IV, Paragraph B hereof, each director shall serve
until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified or until his or
her earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity.

  



  

B. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from
any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the
Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be
filled solely by a majority vote of the directors then in office, although
less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. If there are no directors
in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided
by statute. Directors chosen pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions shall
hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until
their earlier resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
incumbent director. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the
remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, or by the
certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation, may exercise
the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

 _ARTICLE VII_

  



  

A. No action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting and the
power of stockholders to consent in writing, without a meeting, to the taking
of any action is specifically denied.

  



  

B. Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be
called by such persons as provided in the bylaws of the Corporation.

  



  

C. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of
directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner and to the
extent provided in the bylaws of the Corporation.

  



  

D. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of
an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be
the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of
the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii)
any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL,
or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this Article VII, Paragraph D.

  



  

 _ARTICLE VIII_

  



  

A. _Limitation on Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended (including,
but not limited to Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL), a director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
If the DGCL hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability
of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition
to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the amended DGCL. Any repeal or
modification of this paragraph by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the
personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of
such repeal or modification.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

B. _Indemnification_. Each person who is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of such
person), shall be indemnified and advanced expenses by the Corporation, in
accordance with the bylaws of the Corporation, to the fullest extent
authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but,
in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said
law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), or any
other applicable laws as presently or hereinafter in effect. The right to
indemnification and advancement of expenses hereunder shall not be exclusive
of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Corporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

  



  

C. _Insurance_. The Corporation may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss incurred by such
person in any such capacity or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

D. _Repeal and Modification_. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any
right or protection existing hereunder immediately prior to such repeal or
modification.

  



  

 _ARTICLE IX_

  



  

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the shares of the capital stock
of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend in any respect
or repeal this Article IX, Paragraph A of Article V, or Articles VI, VII or
VIII.
