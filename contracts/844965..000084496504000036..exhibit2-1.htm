AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This  Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _ **Agreement**_ "),  dated June
22, 2004, is by and among TETRA Technologies, Inc. (" _ **Parent**_ "),  a
Delaware corporation, TETRA Acquisition Sub, Inc. (" ** _Merger  Sub_** "), a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Parent, and
Compressco, Inc. (" ** _Company_** "),  a Delaware corporation. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and Company is a " ** _Party_** ;"  and together are the "
** _Parties_**."

 

Recitals:

  

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub
and Company  deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders  that Parent acquire Company through the merger of Merger Sub
with and into  Company (the " ** _Merger_** ") upon the terms  and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, and such Boards of Directors  have
approved the Merger;

  

  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
with  the approval of Company's board of directors, Parent, Burt H. Keenan, 
BMT Investment Partners, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, Jerry W.
Jarrell,  D.B.H. Chaffe III, Jack Rettig, and J. Michael Drennen have entered
into a  voting agreement under which such parties have, among other things,
agreed  to support the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth  therein (the " ** _Voting Agreement_** "); and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Brooks  Mims Talton III, Kenneth R. Reagan, Gary McBride and Ronald J. Foster
have  entered into employment and non-competition agreements with Parent to
become  effective at the Effective Time.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations, 
warranties and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

  

  **ARTICLE I**

 

**THE  MERGER**

  

  1.1 **The Merger.** Upon the terms and subject to the conditions  hereof,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Company  and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Company  will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein  as the
" ** _Surviving Corporation_** "). The  Merger will have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the Delaware General  Corporation Law (" ** _DGCL_**
"), including  the Surviving Corporation's succession to and assumption of
all rights  and obligations of Company and Merger Sub.

 

1.2  **Effective Time of the Merger.** The Merger will become effective 
(the " _ **Effective Time**_ ") upon the later  of (i) the filing of a
properly executed Certificate of Merger relating to  the Merger (the " **
_Certificate of Merger_** ")  with the Secretary of State of Delaware in
accordance with the DGCL and (ii)  at such later time as the Parties agree
and set forth in such Certificate  of Merger. The filing of the Certificate
of Merger will be made as soon as  practicable on the Closing Date.

 \t  

**ARTICLE  II**

 

**THE  SURVIVING CORPORATION**

  

2.1  **Certificate of Incorporation**. The certificate of incorporation  of
Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
amendments  to the name of Company) will be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving  Corporation at and after the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance  with the terms thereof and the DGCL.

  

  2.2 **Bylaws**. The bylaws of Company as in effect immediately  prior to
the Effective Time will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation  at and
after the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with  the
terms thereof and as provided by the certificate of incorporation of the 
Surviving Corporation and the DGCL.

  

2.3  **Directors and Officers**. At and after the Effective Time,  the
Merger Sub's directors and officers of the Merger Sub will be the  Surviving
Corporation's directors and officers until their respective  successors have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their  earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's 
Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL.

  

**ARTICLE  III**

 

**CONVERSION  AND ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES**

  

  3.1 **Common Stock Consideration; Conversion of Securities**.  As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on  the part
of the holders of any securities described below:

  

(a)  Each share of the common stock of Company, par value $1.00 (the " **
_Company  Common Stock_** ") issued and outstanding immediately prior  to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 
3.1(b)_ and shares held by the Dissenting Stockholders) will be converted 
into the right to receive $358.15 (such amount the " ** _Per  Share
Consideration_** ") upon surrender of the certificate  or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided  in _Section 3.6_. As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of the Company  Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and  retired and shall
cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 3.7_ , each  holder of a certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  any such shares of
the Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights  with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate  or
certificates as provided in _Section 3.6_ , the Per Share Consideration. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the 
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed 
into a different number of shares or a different class because of any stock 
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination  or exchange of shares, the Per Share Consideration will be
correspondingly  adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization,  split, combination or exchange of
shares. The aggregate amount payable in  consideration

 \t  

of  the Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ is referred 
to as the " ** _Common Stock Consideration_**."

  

(b)  All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in Company's treasury 
or by its Subsidiaries will be canceled and no shares, interests,
participations  or other equivalents (however designated) of capital stock of
a corporation,  and any and all equivalent equity ownership interests in a
Person other than  a corporation (" ** _Capital Stock_** "), cash  or other
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) No share of common stock of Parent that is outstanding immediately prior 
to the Merger will be affected by the Merger. Each issued and outstanding 
share of the Capital Stock of the Merger Sub will be converted into and
become  one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the
Surviving  Corporation.

  

3.2  **Options**.

  

(a)  As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement and prior
to  the Effective Time, Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to  cause each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _
**Company  Option**_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised to be amended 
such that immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding
Company  Option shall be cancelled in exchange for an amount of cash (less
any applicable  withholding), payable at the Effective Time equal to (i) the
excess, if any,  of (A) the Per Share Consideration over (B) the exercise
price thereof, multiplied  by (ii) the number of unexercised shares of
Company Common Stock subject to  such Company Option (the " ** _Per Option
Consideration_** "  and, collectively, the " ** _Option Consideration_** ").

  

(b)  Prior to the Effective Time, Company will use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to (i) cause each outstanding Company Option to be
amended so that  from and after the Effective Time, such Company Option shall
no longer represent  the right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (or
any Capital Stock  of the Surviving Corporation or the Parent) and shall
thereafter only represent  the right to receive the Per Option Consideration,
(ii) obtain the written  consent of each holder of a Company Option that such
holder will not exercise  its Company Options until the termination of this
Agreement and (iii) make  such amendments to the Company Option Plans and
related agreements as necessary  or desirable to implement the provisions of
this _Section 3.2_. The Company  shall take all actions reasonably necessary
or reasonably required by Parent  to ensure that after the Effective Time no
holder of any Company Options or  rights pursuant to, nor any participant in,
any Company Option Plan or any  other plan or agreement providing for the
issuance or grant of any interest  in respect of the Capital Stock of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries  will have any right thereunder to
acquire any equity securities, or right  to payment in respect of the equity
securities, of the Company, any of its  Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent, except as provided  in _Section 3.2(a)_.

 \t  

3.3  **Company Notes**.

  

(a)  As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement and prior
to  the Effective Time, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i)  cause holders of the Company's outstanding convertible subordinated 
notes dated December 22, 2000, as amended (the " ** _Company  Notes_** ") to
agree to cause the Company Notes to be converted  into not more than 37,000
shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance  with their terms, and (ii)
pay all accrued and unpaid interest on such converted  Company Notes
(collectively, the " ** _Note Interest Payment_** ").

 

  (b) At the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall exercise its
prepayment  rights pursuant to Section 2.2(b) of the Company Notes with
respect to any  such Company Notes which are not converted prior to Closing
pursuant to _Section  3.3(a)_ and pay to each holder thereof in full and
complete satisfaction  of the indebtedness evidenced thereby an amount of
cash equal to the unpaid  principal balance of such Company Notes together
with any accrued and unpaid  interest thereon (such amount per note, the " **
_Per Note Consideration_** "  and collectively, the " ** _Note
Consideration_** ").

 

  3.4 **Warrants**. As soon as practicable after the execution  of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use commercially 
reasonable efforts to cause each holder (a " ** _Warrant Holder_** ")  of a
warrant for the purchase shares of the Company Common Stock (each, a  " **
_Company Warrant_** ") and the Parent to  enter into an agreement pursuant to
which each such Warrant Holder agrees  to sell, and the Parent agrees to
purchase, the Company Warrants at a price  equal to (i) the excess of (A) the
Per Share Consideration over (B) the exercise  price thereof, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock  subject to such Company
Warrant (such payment to be net of withholding taxes)  (the " ** _Per Warrant
Consideration_** " and,  collectively, the " ** _Warrant Consideration_**
").  As of the Effective Time, any such Company Warrants which are not
tendered  to Parent by the respective Warrant Holder shall terminate in
accordance with  its terms and the Warrant Holder of such Company Warrant
shall have no further  rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of
Company, any Subsidiary  thereof or the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.5  **Merger Consideration**.

 

(a)  The Common Stock Consideration, Warrant Consideration, Option
Consideration  and Note Consideration is collectively referred to as the " **
_Merger  Consideration_**." All Merger Consideration paid upon the 
surrender of certificates or instruments representing the Company Common
Stock,  Company Warrants, Company Options and remaining Company Notes which
have not  been converted (collectively, the " _ **Company Instruments**_ ") 
in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in full 
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Instruments formerly 
represented thereby. From and after the Effective Time there will be no
further  registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving  Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Instruments  are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they will be cancelled  and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

 \t  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
Merger  Consideration payable by the Parent with respect to the Company
Instruments  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not
exceed $90,457,031  plus any cash proceeds the Company receives in connection
with the exercise  of any Company Options or Company Warrants listed on
_Schedule 4.2(a)_.

  

  3.6 **Surrender and Payment**.

 

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize one or more transfer
agent(s)  reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent hereunder
(the " ** _Exchange  Agent_** "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will  deliver to Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of the
outstanding  Company Common Stock, Company Warrants, Company Options and
Company Notes  a cash amount equal to the applicable Merger Consideration.
The aggregate  amount of funds delivered to Exchange Agent pursuant to the
preceding sentence  will be the " ** _Exchange Fund_**."

 

  (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.6(d)_ ,
Exchange  Agent will promptly distribute from the Exchange Fund in exchange
for a duly  executed and properly completed letter of transmittal and
surrendered certificates  or instruments representing Company Instruments of
any individual, corporation,  limited liability company, partnership,
association, trust or any other entity  or organization, including a
Governmental Authority (" ** _Person_** ")  (other than Dissenting
Stockholders), an aggregate amount equal to (i) with  respect to certificates
representing Company Common Stock, the product of  (A) the Per Share
Consideration times (B) the number of shares of Company  Common Stock
represented by such certificate, (ii) with respect to the Company  Notes
which have not been converted, the applicable Per Note Consideration,  (iii)
with respect to Company Warrants, the applicable Per Warrant Consideration, 
and (iv) with respect to the Company Options, the applicable Per Option
Consideration.

 

(c)  Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than three
Business  Days thereafter, Parent will, or instruct Exchange Agent to, send
to each  holder of Company Instruments a letter of transmittal and
instructions for  use in effecting the exchange of such Company Instruments
for the applicable  Merger Consideration. " ** _Business Day_** "  means any
date that is not a Saturday or Sunday or other day on which banks  are
required or authorized by law to be closed in the city of New York.
Provision  also will be made for holders of Company Instruments to procure in
person  immediately after the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions  and to deliver in person immediately after the Effective Time
such letter  of transmittal and Company Instruments in exchange for the
applicable Merger  Consideration.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, Company Instruments will represent the right, 
upon surrender thereof to Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed and 
properly completed letter of transmittal relating thereto, to receive in
exchange  therefor the Merger Consideration subject to any required tax
withholding,  and the Company Instruments so surrendered will be canceled. No
interest will  be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender  of any such Company Instruments. Until so

 \t  

surrendered,  each such Company Instrument will, after the Effective Time,
represent for  all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 

(e) If cash is to be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of 
the Company Instruments surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a
condition  to such payment that the Company Instruments so surrendered will
be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting  such payment will pay to Exchange Agent any transfer
or other taxes required  as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder or  establish to the satisfaction of Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid  or is not applicable.

  

(f)  Any funds in the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company  Instruments one year after the Effective Time will be returned to
Parent,  upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such
holder's  certificates or instruments representing the applicable Company
Instrument  (the " ** _Certificates_** ") in accordance with  this _Section
3.6_ prior to that time will thereafter look only to Parent,  as a general
creditor thereof, to exchange such Certificates for the applicable  Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article 
III_. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to six years 
after the Effective Time (or, in any particular case, prior to such earlier 
date on which any applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of such 
Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental  unit or agency), the applicable Merger Consideration issuable
or payable in  respect of such Certificates will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law,  become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of  any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none  of Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation, Exchange
Agent or any other  Person will be liable to any holder of Certificates for
any Merger Consideration  paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat  or similar laws.

 

(g) If any Company Instrument has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the 
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Instrument  to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation,  the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as Parent may  direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect  to such Company Instrument, Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed Company Instrument the Merger
Consideration in respect  thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  3.7 **Dissenter 's Rights**. Any shares of Company Common  Stock that a
stockholder thereof properly exercising its dissent or appraisal  rights
under the DGCL (a " ** _Dissenting Stockholder_** ")  holds will be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may  be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Stockholder under the DGCL; except  that any such shares
that a Dissenting Stockholder holds for which, after  the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for purchase  or loses its
purchase right as provided in the DGCL, will be deemed to be  converted, as
of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration.

 \t  

3.8  **Closing**. The closing of the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement (the " ** _Closing_** ") will  take place in the offices of Akin
Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP at 1111  Louisiana Street, 44th Floor, Houston,
Texas 77002 or such other location  mutually acceptable to Company and
Parent, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the  date on which all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ are satisfied  or waived or at such
other date and time as Company and Parent will otherwise  agree; _provided_
that if all of the conditions set forth in _Article  VIII_ are satisfied or
waived (other than the conditions set forth in _Section  8.2(c)_ , _(d)_ or
_(e)_ ) and Parent and Merger Sub waive any  condition set forth in _Section
8.2(c)_ , _(d)_ or _(e)_ , Company  shall have the right to extend the date
on which the Closing occurs for up  to 10 days after any such condition is
waived (the date on which the Closing  occurs is referred to as the " **
_Closing Date_** ");  provided, however, that during any such 10 day
extension, the Company shall  not have the right to terminate this Agreement
except as provided in _Sections  10.1(d)_ or _10.1(h)_.

Merger Sub and to their respective financial advisors, legal counsel, 
accountants, consultants, financing sources, and other authorized
representatives  access during normal business hours throughout the period
ending on the Closing  Date to all of Company's and its Subsidiaries' books,
records,  properties, contracts, leases, plants and personnel and, during
such period,  Company will furnish promptly to the Parent and Merger Sub (a)
a copy of each  report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
pursuant to the  requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information  as such the Parent reasonably may request. Notwithstanding
any other provision  of this Agreement, Company will not be required to make
available any information  if such action could reasonably be expected to
result in loss of any applicable  attorney-client privilege. The
Confidentiality Agreement dated April 13, 2004  between Parent and Company
(the " ** _Confidentiality Agreement_** ")  will survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. If this Agreement  is terminated, each Party will
deliver to the other all documents, work papers  and other materials
(including copies) obtained by such Party or on its behalf  from the other
Party as a result of this Agreement or in connection herewith,  whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof.

 

7.2  **No Solicitation of Transactions**.

 

(a)  From the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time  and the termination hereof, Company agrees that (i) it and its
officers, directors  and employees will not, (ii) Company Subsidiaries and
Company Subsidiaries'  officers and directors will not and (iii) it will use
commercially reasonable  efforts to ensure that its and Company Subsidiaries'
agents and representatives  will not, directly or indirectly (A) take any
action to solicit, initiate  or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any  proposal that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition  Proposal, (B) engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, or  disclose any nonpublic information
relating to Company or any Company Subsidiary,  or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate  in any way with an
Acquisition Proposal, (C) approve or recommend or propose  publicly to
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (D) enter into  any
agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplating or relating to any 
Acquisition Proposal or requiring Company to abandon, terminate or fail to 
consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the
provisions  of _Section 7.2(c)_ below, nothing contained in this Agreement
will prevent  Company or its board of directors from (i) taking and
disclosing

 \t  

to  its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated  under the Exchange Act, provided that such action shall not
include any Adverse  Recommendation Change except upon compliance with
_Section 7.2(c)_ below,  (ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders'
Approval, waiving,  or agreeing to waive, any provision of any stand-still or
similar agreement  in effect on the date hereof to allow a Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal  or (iii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders'
Approval, furnishing  information, including nonpublic information to, or
entering into negotiations  with, any Person that has submitted an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal  made if, and only to the extent
that (with respect to this _Section 7.2_   only):

 

(i) such unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made by a third party 
that Company's board of directors determines in good faith has the good 
faith intent to proceed with negotiations to consider, and the financial and 
legal capability to consummate, such Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii) Company's board of directors (after consultation with its legal 
counsel) determines in good faith that such action is legally advisable for 
the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable 
law;

 

(iii) contemporaneously with furnishing such information to, or entering
into  discussions with, such Person, Company enters into a confidentiality
agreement  with such Person on terms no less restrictive than those in the
Confidentiality  Agreement; and

 

(iv) Company's board of directors determines in good faith after
consultation  with its financial advisors and legal counsel that such
Acquisition Proposal  is reasonably capable of being completed and may
reasonably be expected to  result in a transaction that is more favorable
from a financial point of view  to the holders of Company Common Stock than
the Merger.

  

(b)  The Company's board of directors shall not directly or indirectly (i) 
(A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose  to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent) the
approval, recommendation  or declaration of advisability by the board of this
Agreement, the Merger  or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend,  adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any  Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred  to as an " ** _Adverse Recommendation
Change_** ")  or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend,  or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or
enter into,  any agreement, including any letter of intent, merger agreement,
acquisition  agreement, option agreement, or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding,  (A) constituting or related to, or that is
intended to lead to, any Acquisition  Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement as described in _Section  7.2(a)(iii)_ above) (each an " **
_Acquisition Agreement_** ")  or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger  as contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time  prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholders' Approval, and subject to  the Company's compliance at all times

 \t  

with  the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ and if applicable _Sections
10.1(f)_   and _10.2(c)(ii)_ , the Company's board of directors may (A)
make  an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate
this  Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ and concurrently enter into
an  Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (provided that
the  Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to _Section
10.2(c)(ii)_ )  in the case of either clause (A) or clause (B) only after the
Company (x)  provides written notice to Parent (a " ** _Notice of Superior 
Proposal_** ") advising Parent that the Company's board  of directors has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms  and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person or group  making such
Superior Proposal and representing that such Superior Proposal  was not
solicited, facilitated or encouraged by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries 
or any of their respective officers or directors, investment bankers,
attorneys,  accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives,
and (y)  through its Board of Directors determines in good faith (1) after
the receipt  of advice from its financial advisors that any alternative
transaction (including  any modifications to the terms of this Agreement)
proposed by Parent pursuant  to the terms herein is not at least as favorable
to the Company and its stockholders  from a financial point of view as the
Superior Proposal and (2) after receipt  of advice from its outside counsel
that its failure to do so would be reasonably  expected to result in a breach
of fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided,  however, that (I) the
Company's board of directors may not make an Adverse  Recommendation Change
until 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time on the fourth Business  Day after
Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, (II)  any change in the
financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal  shall require a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new four Business Day  period under this
_Section 7.2(c)_ and (III) the Company shall not be  entitled to enter into
any agreement, including any Acquisition Agreement,  with respect to a
Superior Proposal until 5:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time on  the fourth
Business Day after Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior  Proposal and
unless and until this Agreement is terminated by its terms pursuant  to
Section 10.1(f) and the Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant 
to Section 10.2(c)(ii). Upon receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal,
Parent  shall have the right and option, at its discretion, for the period
provided  above to modify the terms of the Merger and/or match any Superior
Proposal  as described in the Notice of Superior Proposal. In the event
Parent shall  match the Merger Consideration offered by the third party as
described in  the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall terminate
any further negotiations  with the third party submitting such Superior
Proposal and continue with and  consummate the modified transaction submitted
by Parent.

 

(c)  Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any  existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted  heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. " **
_Acquisition  Proposal_** " means any proposal or offer to acquire,
directly  or indirectly, all or a material portion of Company's Capital
Stock  or assets whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer,
exchange offer  or otherwise, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

7.3  **Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance**. 

 

(a)  For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation  will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or has been  at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective  Time, an officer or director of Company or its Subsidiaries or an
employee  of Company or any of its Subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary under
any Company  Employee Benefit Plans (each an " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") 
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses
(including  fees and disbursements of counsel and experts and judgments,
fines, losses,  claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (
_provided_ , that  any such settlement is effected with the prior written
consent of Parent,  which will not be unreasonably withheld)) arising in
whole or in part out  of actions or omissions in their capacity as such
occurring at or prior to  the Effective Time to the full extent permitted
under Delaware law or Parent's  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
Company's written indemnification  agreements in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , that if any claim  or claims are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to  indemnification in respect of any such claim
or claims will continue until  disposition of any and all such claims; and
_provided, further_ , that  any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified  Party's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Delaware  law, Parent's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or such agreements,  as the case may be, will be made
by independent counsel mutually acceptable  to Parent and the Indemnified
Party; and _provided, further_ , that  nothing herein will impair any rights
or obligations of any Indemnified Party.  If any claim or claims are brought
against any Indemnified Party (whether  arising before or after the Effective
Time), such Indemnified Party may select  counsel for the defense of such
claim, which counsel will be reasonably acceptable  to Company (if selected
prior to the Effective Time) and Parent (if selected  after the Effective
Time).

 

(b) Parent shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of 
each Indemnified Party in connection with any such action or proceeding
described  above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest extent
permitted by the  DGCL.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent
contained  in this _Section 7.3_ will be binding upon Parent's successors 
and assigns. If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates 
with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially 
all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
proper  provision will be made so that successors and assigns of Parent honor
the  indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 7.3_.

 

(d)  Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's obligations under this 
_Section 7.3_ will survive the consummation of the Merger and will not  be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified  Party to whom this _Section 7.3_ applies without the consent of
such  affected Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Parties are third party
beneficiaries  of this _Section 7.3_ , each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this  _Section 7.3_.

 \t  

7.4  **Further Assurances**. Subject to the terms and conditions of  this
Agreement, each Party will use all commercially reasonable efforts to  take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all  things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations,  or to
remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, for the consummation 
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including, 
without limitation, the Company's delivery of the consents required  by the
Company as listed on _Schedule 4.4_. The Parties will take such  further
action to deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing  and
at such other times thereafter as will be reasonably agreed by such
additional  agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request
for the purpose  of carrying out this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The  Parties will afford each other access to all
information, documents, records  and personnel that may be necessary for any
Party to comply with laws or regulations,  to fulfill its obligations with
respect to indemnification hereunder or to  defend itself against suits or
claims of others. Parent and Company will duly  preserve all files, records
or any similar items of Parent or Company received  or obtained as a result
of the Merger with the same care and for the same  period of time as it would
preserve its own similar assets. Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Agreement, no Party will be required to make available  any information if
such action could reasonably be expected to result in loss  of any applicable
attorney-client privilege.

 

7.5  **Cooperation**. Subject to compliance with applicable law, from  the
date hereof until the Effective Time, each Party will confer on a regular 
and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other Parties to 
report operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing 
operations and will promptly provide the other Party or its counsel with
copies  of all filings made by such Party with any Governmental Authority in
connection  with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_   that no Party shall be required to make any disclosure if such
action could  reasonably be expected to result in loss of any applicable
attorney-client  privilege.

 

7.6  **Publicity**. Neither Company, Parent nor any of their respective 
affiliates will issue or cause the publication of any press release or other 
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions  contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the other
Party; provided,  however, that each Party hereto may make any disclosure or
announcement which  such Party, after consultation with its legal counsel,
determines it is obligated  to make pursuant to applicable law or regulation
of any national securities  exchange or market; provided further that in such
case such Party shall use  its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other Parties with a copy  of such announcement and afford such Party the
opportunity to comment thereon.  Each Party will use reasonable efforts to
provide copies of such release or  other announcement to the other Party, and
give due consideration to such  comments as such other Party may have, prior
to such release.

 

7.7  **Expenses**. Except as provided in _Sections 7.3_ , _10.2(c)_   and

incur. " ** _Expenses_** " include  all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including all reasonable fees and expenses  of outside counsel, accountants,

amendments thereof or supplements  thereto, at the time the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto)  is first sent to stockholders, at
the time of the Company Stockholders'  Meeting or at the Effective Time,
contains any untrue statement of a material  fact or omit to state any
material fact required

 \t  

to  be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

not obtained upon a vote at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided,

party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the  voting power
of Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets  of Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting  of cash
and/or securities that Company's board of directors in good  faith
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside 
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, result 
in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to 
the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger;

 

(g) by Parent if (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred  or
the Company's board of directors resolves to make an Adverse Recommendation 
Change or the Company's board of directors recommends to Company's 
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or resolves to do so; or (ii) a tender 
offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company's Capital  Stock

stockholders  not tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer; and

  

(h)  by either Parent or Company if any Governmental Authority or court of
competent  jurisdiction has issued any order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action  (collectively, " ** _Governmental Order_** ")  permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and  such
Governmental Order has become final and nonappealable, _provided_ that  the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement has used its reasonable best 
efforts to remove or lift such Governmental Order.

has otherwise become  known to the Company's directors or officers and
thereafter this Agreement  is terminated by either Parent or Company pursuant
to either _Section 10.1(b)_   or _Section 10.1(e)_ , then in any such case,
Company shall reimburse Parent  for all expenses of Parent up to $200,000
(the " ** _Expense  Cap_** ") and, in each case, within twelve months after
such  termination:

 

(A) a transaction is consummated, which transaction, if offered or proposed, 
would constitute an Acquisition Proposal,

 

(B) a definitive agreement (the execution and delivery of which has been
authorized  by the boards of directors, or comparable bodies) that would if
consummated  constitute an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, or

 

(C) (X) any Person acquires beneficial ownership or the right to acquire

Company then representing  50% or more of the combined power to vote
generally for the election of directors,  and (Y) Company's board of

fee  equal to $3,266,065 (the " ** _Termination Fee_** ").

does not have the right to terminate  this Agreement under _Sections 10.1(d)_
or _10.1(h)_ or (y) Company or Parent  terminates this Agreement under
_Section 10.1(f)_ (Superior Proposal),  Company shall promptly (and in any
event no later than one Business Day after  such termination provided that in
the case of a termination by Company pursuant  to _Section 10.1(f)_ , such
payment shall be made simultaneously with  such termination) pay to Parent
the Termination Fee plus Parent's expenses  up to the Expense Cap.

 \t  

(d)  If Company terminates this Agreement under (i) _Section 10.1(d)_ (Parent
