development of integration plans for implementation by Purchaser of the
Business following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no

_Section 8.2_, Purchaser will not contact any employee, customer, client or
supplier of Parent, any Seller, any Purchased Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries without the participation or prior written consent of

Purchaser shall preserve and retain all accounting, legal, auditing and other
books and records (including any documents relating to any Proceedings
arising out of or with respect to the operation or conduct of the Business,
regardless of whether such Proceeding is initiated before or after the
Closing) over which it has control to the extent relating to the conduct of
the Business prior to the Closing Date (which shall include, for the
avoidance doubt, all facts and circumstances occurring or existing prior to
the Closing that may give rise to a Claim by any Person, even if such Claim
is not made until after the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
such six-year period, either party may dispose of any such books and records
which are offered to, but not accepted by, the other party.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Closing, if, in order to properly prepare
documents required to be filed with Governmental Bodies (including Tax
Authorities and the SEC) or its financial statements, or for any other
reasonable business purpose, it is necessary that Parent or a Seller (or its
Subsidiaries or successors), on the one hand, or Purchaser (or its
Subsidiaries or successors), on the other hand, be furnished with additional
information of the type described in _Section 8.3(a) _above, and such
information is in the possession of the other party, such other party agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such information to the
party that requires such information, at the cost and expense of the
party being furnished such information.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event of, and for so long as any party hereto (or its
Affiliates) is prosecuting, participating in, contesting or defending any
Proceeding, whenever filed or made, in connection with or involving (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) the conduct or
operation of the Business (including the German Business) prior to the
Closing or the conduct or operation of the Excluded Businesses (or the
Retained German Contracts) prior to or after the Closing, the other party
hereto shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, (A) cooperate
with it and its counsel in, and assist it and its counsel with, the contest
or defense, (B) make available its personnel (including for purposes of fact
finding, consultation, interviews, depositions and, if required, as
witnesses), and (C) provide such information, testimony and documents,

### 

  

### including, but not limited to, books and records, contracts, and
commitments of the Business, whether stored in paper, electronic, or other
format, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, in each case
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense,
all at the sole cost and expense (not including employee compensation and
benefits costs) of the prosecuting, participating, contesting or defending
party (unless such party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
_ARTICLE IX_ or _ARTICLE XIII_ ). For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
8.3(c) _shall not apply with respect to disputes between Parent, a Seller,
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates. The covenants in this _Section 8.3(c)
_shall not be deemed to limit the access and cooperation to be provided to
Sellers by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.2_,  _8.3(a) _or _8.3(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (d) At least twenty (20) days prior to Closing, Sellers and their
Subsidiaries shall cause the Financial Statements and the Subsequent

Date. The September 28, 2007 audited financial Statements shall include an
audit report from Deloitte and Touche that is no more qualified than the audit
report for the September 29, 2006 audited financial statements previously
provided to Purchaser. All such financial statements shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and Regulations S-X of the SEC. Prior to and after the
Closing, Sellers shall request, and take all reasonable steps necessary to
encourage, the auditors of such financial statements to cooperate with the
Purchaser and provide all necessary consents required by the SEC and
customary "comfort letters" in connection with securities offerings of
Purchaser, in each case at Purchasers sole cost and expense.

  



  

8.4 _Cooperation_.

  



  

### (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur
(subject to the limitation in the proviso to _Section 8.4(c))_, including
taking all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Closing. Each Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to, take any actions that would, or
that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE X_ not being satisfied. Furthermore, Parent, each Seller
and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to mutually agree upon the terms
of the Transition Services Agreement prior to the Closing Date on terms that
are commercially reasonable and otherwise as the parties may agree. Among
other things, the Transition Services Agreement shall provide for Parents
access to Retained Employees with knowledge of the Brazil Business, the
German Business and the Retained German Contracts and such employees shall
provide general assistance to Parent in connection with Parents operation of
the Brazil Business and the Retained German Contracts (the " _Brazil and
German Services_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Brazil and German Services shall be provided for
a term of not less than 36 months (unless terminated earlier by Parent), or
in the case of warranty claims

  

### 

  

### 58   

     
   

  

### 

  

### related to the Retained German Contracts, for so long as such warranties
remain in effect, at a charge equal to the actual out-of-pocket costs
incurred by a Purchased Company (or Subsidiary thereof) in connection with
the provision of the Brazil and German Services, and such charges shall not
include any internal allocated costs of any Purchased Company (or Subsidiary
thereof).

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the terms of this _Section 8.4_, Sellers, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall (i) as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement make any filings required by any
Governmental Body pursuant to the HSR Act or other Competition Laws in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, (ii) respond
promptly to inquiries from the applicable Governmental Bodies in connection
with such filings, including providing any supplemental information that may
be requested by such Governmental Bodies, and (iii) provide to the other
copies of any filings made under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws
promptly after the time they are filed with the applicable Governmental
Bodies, excluding any information included in any such filings that the party
has a need to keep confidential. Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act
or other Competition Laws.  Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or request for additional information
from, Governmental Bodies pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition
Laws.  Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Purchaser and Sellers shall be responsible for their respective fees and all
costs and submission of all regulatory filings related to any required
governmental or regulatory approvals, including the HSR Act (which fee under
the HSR Act, for avoidance of doubt, shall be borne by Purchaser), under the
Applicable non-U.S. Antitrust Approvals and with respect to any other
applicable Laws.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all Consents from third parties in respect of
Contracts to the extent such Contracts require such Consents as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
parties shall not be required to pay or commit to (i) amend, supplement or
modify any Contract or take any action with respect to any related project or
(ii) pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from
whom any such Consent may be required (other than nominal filing or
application fees), except as otherwise required by Law or the applicable
Contract. From and after the Effective Date until the Closing, Sellers and
Purchaser shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
such other instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions
as Sellers or Purchaser may reasonably request (including, without
limitation, the execution and delivery of summary translations and/or short
form stock or asset purchase agreements), in order to more effectively
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
_however_ that in the event of a conflict between any term or provision of
(A) any such summary or agreement, on the one hand, and (B) the terms and

  

### 

  

### 59   

     
   

  

### 

  

### provisions of this Agreement, on the other hand, the terms and provisions
of this Agreement shall control.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, each shall
keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of written notices or other written
communications received by Purchaser or Parent or any Seller, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or representatives, from any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Sellers shall give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
give prompt notice to Sellers, of, and each such party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent, or promptly remedy, (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement that is
qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect (it being understood that any breach of
this provision shall be treated as a breach of the representations and
warranties for purposes of indemnification hereunder) or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement
within the time contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

### (f) With respect to any third party Software that is necessary for the
Business as currently conducted and that is licensed to the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries pursuant to an enterprise-wide Software license, the Sellers
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the
respective licensors of such third party Software to a partial assignment, a
grant of a sublicense by the Sellers (each such sublicense only to be
effective until the Sellers next payment is due to such licensor under
the applicable Software license), or the grant of a new license to Purchaser,
to the number of copies of the applicable Software application that are used
for the Business as currently conducted.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with any of the foregoing.  The
Sellers and Purchaser agree that in the case of a partial assignment, any
such division of rights, responsibilities and credits (including without
limitation any credits for pre-paid fees) between them under the existing
enterprise licenses shall be in proportion to the actual usage (by seat
count) of such Software applications by the Business immediately prior to the
Closing Date to the actual usage (by seat count) of the Sellers and
their Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date taken as a whole.

  



  

8.5 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

### (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference.

  

### 

  

### 60   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate except with respect to provisions
regarding disclosure and use of confidential information not related to the
Business.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subsequent to the Closing, each Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to) hold, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its respective representatives to hold, in strict confidence from any Person
(other than any such representative) all non-public documents and information
concerning the other party or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to it by the
other party or such other partys Subsidiaries or representatives, or to
which such party otherwise has obtained access, in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Confidential
Information_ "), except to the extent that such documents or information can
be shown to have been (A) previously known by the party receiving such
documents or information (excluding, with respect to Sellers and their
Subsidiaries, information relating to the Business), (B) in the public domain
(either prior to or after the furnishing of such documents or information
hereunder) through no fault of such receiving party or (C) later lawfully
acquired by the receiving party from another source if the receiving party
does not have actual knowledge that such source is under an obligation
to another party hereto to keep such documents and information confidential;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing restrictions will not apply to
the Purchasers and its Subsidiaries use of documents and information
concerning the Business. In the event that a Seller (or any of its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, or Purchaser (or any of its Subsidiaries), on
the other hand, is requested or required (by oral question, interrogatory,
request for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information of the other, such
party shall (x) provide the other party with prompt written notice so that
such other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or
waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section 8.5(b) _and (y)
cooperate with such other party in any effort such other party undertakes to
obtain a protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained or such other party waives compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 8.5(b)_, such party shall disclose to
the Person compelling disclosure only that portion of the Confidential
Information that such party is advised by its counsel is legally required and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment is accorded the Confidential Information so disclosed
(to the extent available). For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the
Closing, Confidential Information includes all non-public documents and
information regarding the Business, and Sellers and their Subsidiaries and
representatives shall be treated as the receiving party thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 8.5_ to the
contrary, Purchaser shall have the right, upon receiving Parents prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to disclose any or
all of the Confidential Information received from Sellers to a party with
whom Purchaser desires to discuss the possibility of acquiring some portion
of the Business (the " _Prospective Acquirers_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Prospective Acquirer first enters into a confidentiality agreement
with Parent and Purchaser at least as protective of the Confidential

works council where such notification or consultation is required by
applicable Law regarding the transaction contemplated hereby. All

Closing Date of all Non-U.S. Business Employees and U.S. Business Employees
employed by the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries immediately prior

or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date. To the extent that any
Non-U.S. Business Employee or U.S. Business Employee would not otherwise be
employed by a Purchased Company or a Subsidiary of a Purchased Company as of
the Closing, then, prior to the Closing Date but effective as of the Closing,
Sellers shall, subject to the consent of the applicable employee (to the
extent such consent is required under applicable Law), transfer to employment
with the appropriate Purchased Company or Subsidiary any such Non-U.S.
Business Employee or U.S. Business Employee and, from and after the Closing
Date, all such employees shall continue in employment with the applicable
Purchased Company or Subsidiary unless and until such employment
is terminated.

  

### 

  

### (c) As of the Closing Date and for a period of at least one (1) year

### such Retained Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, _provided_
, _however_ , that Purchaser will provide each Retained Employee with
severance benefits equal to those provided by Sellers, the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries for such one year period; and _provided_  
_further_ _that_ with respect to each U.S. Business Employee and
each Non-U.S. Business Employee who is a participant in a medical or dental
plan maintained by Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof) that is not an
Assumed Plan, Purchaser shall either (A) establish a new medical and dental
plan to provide such employees medical and dental benefits as of the Closing
Date or (B) allow such employees to participate in an existing medical or
dental plan that is maintained by Purchaser (each a " _Purchaser Welfare

Closing Date; and _further_ _provided_ _that_  Purchaser shall be responsible
in accordance with the applicable Purchaser Welfare Plans for all
reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims arising from injuries
or services incurred on or after the Closing Date) and for expenses incurred,
from and after the Closing by such employees and their dependents. In
connection with the foregoing, Purchaser and Parent will cooperate in
communicating with and enrolling the Business Employees in Purchasers
employee benefit plans. Additionally, (i) to the extent that any employee
bonuses have been accrued as a current liability on the books and records of
the Business in the Ordinary Course, Purchaser shall cause such bonuses to be
paid in the Ordinary Course; (ii) to the extent that any other liability
under any U.S. Business Benefit Plan, that is not an Assumed Plan, has been
accrued as a current liability on the books and records of the Business, the
Purchaser shall either pay such benefits in the Ordinary Course or reimburse
Seller for any such benefits paid by Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) up to
the amount accrued on the books and records of the Business as of the Closing
Date (for avoidance of doubt, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
be responsible for any liabilities, such as any medical claims incurred-but-
not-reported associated with any self insured health and welfare plans, to
the extent such liability is accrued as a current liability on the books and
records of the Business as of the Closing Date); and (iii) in accordance with
the terms of that certain Notification Letter between Purchaser and Parent,
(A) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Purchased Companies
to, honor the terms of the retention agreements set forth in the Notification
Letter and pay out any retention payments in accordance with the terms of
such retention agreements (the " _Retention Payments_ ") and (B) as soon as
practicable following the provision by Purchaser of written confirmation
indicating that any Retention Payments have been made to the applicable
individual, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of such Retention Payments.

  

### 

  

### (d) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to give, or
cause each Purchased Company to give, each Retained Employee credit under any
benefit plan or personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the

maintained from time to time by Purchaser or the Purchased Company, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and
severance benefits for the Retained Employees service with the Business
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that no such service shall be
credited for the purpose of determining an accrued benefit under any pension
plan (other than any Assumed Plan as set forth below) of the Purchaser or the
Purchased Company (except to the extent such service is recognized under any
Assumed

### 63

### Plan as of the Closing Date) or to the extent that would result in a
duplication of benefits; (ii) to allow such Retained Employees to participate
in each plan providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance,
long-term disability insurance and long-term care insurance) without regard
to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained
Employee by the corresponding Business Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing Date; and (iii) if any of the benefit plans are terminated prior to
the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date, to credit the
Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the plans for
purposes of determining deductibles and other applicable limits under any
similar replacement plans.

  

### 

  

### (e) Purchaser shall cause each Purchased Company to honor the accrued
and unused vacation and personal holiday amounts (including any earned
vacation or personal holiday pay to be used in future years) each Retained
Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing Date and
Purchaser shall discharge such obligations in the Ordinary Course after
Closing.

  

### 

  

### (f) All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee
benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of
the respective parties hereto and shall not create any third-party
beneficiary or other right in any other Person, including any employee or
former employee of the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries or
any participant or beneficiary in any Business Benefit Plan.

  

### 

  

### (g) This _Section 8.6_ shall survive the Closing, is intended to
benefit Purchaser and the Purchased Companies, and shall be binding on the
Purchaser and the Purchased Companies. Nothing set forth in this _Section
8.6_ shall confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or former employee
of the Business, any Retained Employee or upon any other Person other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in
this _Section 8.6_ shall obligate Purchaser or the Purchased Companies to
continue the employment of any Retained Employee for any specific period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the preceding or any other
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to interfere with
Purchasers rights to amend or terminate any of the employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Purchaser or any Purchased
Company, or interpreted as an amendment or other modification of any Business
Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not relieve
Purchaser from its obligations set forth in _Section _ _8.6(c) _(it being
understood and agreed that all benefits (excluding severance) currently
provided by Purchaser to its employees are substantially similar in the
aggregate to such benefits currently provided to the Business Employees in
similar geographical locations).

  



  

8.7 _Employee Plans_.

  



  

### (a) Each Retained Employee who is a participant in the Tyco (US)
Retirement Savings and Investment Plan IV and V (collectively, the " _Seller

Savings Plans effective as of the Closing Date. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause (to the extent it does not already meet the
following requirements) the AECOM Technology

to (i) be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) include a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code in which Retained Employees shall be immediately eligible to
participate.  Effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall take such
actions necessary to fully vest each Retained Employee in his or her account
balance under the Seller Savings Plans. As soon as practicable, but no later
than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions so
that the Seller Savings Plans shall transfer to the Purchaser Savings Plan,
and Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Purchaser Savings Plan to accept such transfer, via a trust-to-trust
transfer, the account balance (including promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans and subject to any qualified domestic relations orders
pursuant to Section 414(p) of the Code) of each Retained Employee under the
Seller Savings Plans as of the valuation date next preceding the date of
transfer and such transfer shall be made in accordance with the requirements
of the Code and ERISA. Such transfer shall be subject to Sellers receipt of
evidence satisfactory to them that the Purchaser Savings Plan is qualified
under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, which evidence may include a
current determination letter from the IRS indicating that the Purchaser
Savings Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.
Following such transfer, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
assume all Liabilities of Parent, Sellers and their Affiliates under the
Seller Savings Plans to provide benefits to or on behalf of the Retained
Employees to the extent of the account balances so transferred, and neither
the Seller Savings Plans nor Parent, Sellers or their Affiliates shall have
any obligation to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or with respect to any
Retained Employee with respect thereto.

Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall accept the sponsorship of the Seller
Pension Plan, shall receive the assets and assume all Liabilities of such
Seller Pension Plan, and shall hold Parent, each Seller and their respective
Affiliates harmless regarding the same. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall establish a trust (the " _Purchaser s Pension Plan Trust_")
that meets the requirements of the Code and ERISA applicable to a trust
established to hold assets of an Employee Benefit Pension Plan qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, (i) Parent shall cause the master trustee of the trust that
holds the assets of the Seller Pension Plan to transfer to the trustee of
the Purchasers Pension Plan Trust the assets relating to the Seller
Pension Plan. Such transfer shall be subject to Parents receipt from the
Purchaser of a copy of the Purchasers Pension Plan Trust and such
information as is satisfactory to Parent and the trustee of the Seller
Pension Plan prior to the Closing Date to establish that the
Purchasers Pension Plan Trust meets all applicable requirements of ERISA and
the Code. The amount so transferred shall be reduced by any distribution or
other benefit payments that are made under the Seller Pension Plan with
respect to any participant in the Seller Pension Plan in pay status or who is
entitled to payment on or prior to the Closing Date or any Retained Employee
who retires, dies or otherwise terminates his service with Purchaser after
the Closing Date and before the transfer of assets described in this _Section
8.7(b)_.  Parent shall cause the benefit payments referred to in the

### 65   

      
 

  



  

### preceding sentence to be made from the Seller Pension Plan until the
transfer of assets described in this _Section 8.7(b) _shall occur. Upon
consummation of such assignment of sponsorship and transfer of assets, the
Parent, Sellers and their Affiliates shall not have any further Liability to
any participant in the Seller Pension Plan and, notwithstanding the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the fiduciaries of the
Seller Pension Plan, Parent, each Seller and all Affiliates, employees,
officers, directors and advisors of any of the foregoing with respect to any
Liabilities which arise out of any claims for benefits made by any
participant in the Seller Pension Plan with respect to the Seller
Pension Plan.

  



  

### (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have, or to cause its Affiliates to have, the AECOM
Corporation Stock Purchase Plan or such substantially similar non-qualified
deferred compensation plan (the " _Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plan_ ")
in effect so that each Retained Employee who is eligible to be a participant
in the Tyco International (US) Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
and/or the Tyco Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan (collectively, the "
_Seller Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") shall be immediately eligible to
participate in the Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plan. As soon
as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to
be taken such actions. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
assume or have any Liability with respect to the Seller Deferred Compensation
Plans and any Retained Employees participation thereunder.

  



  

### (d) Effective on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, (i) assume (or retain as applicable) the sponsorship
of the U.S. Business Benefit Plans and Non-U.S. Business Benefit Plans
identified with an asterisk on _Schedule 5.7(a) _or _Schedule 5.7(l)_ ,
as applicable, (the " _Assumed Plans_ "), (ii) assume (or retain
as applicable) all Liabilities and responsibilities of the applicable Sellers
(or applicable Affiliate of a Seller) under the Assumed Plans and the portion
of the Seller Savings Plans attributable to Retained Employees (the "
_Assumed Plan Liabilities_ ") and (iii) indemnify Parent, Sellers and
their respective Affiliates against, and hold Parent, Sellers and their
respective Affiliates harmless from, all Losses suffered or incurred to the
extent arising out of or related to the Assumed Plan Liabilities. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, effective as of the Closing Date, each
Non-U.S. Business Employee and U.S. Business Employee employed by the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries at the Closing shall cease to
participate in, or accrue any benefits under, all U.S. Business Benefit Plans
and Non-U.S. Business Benefit Plans that are not an Assumed Plan. At the
request of Purchaser, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers
will cooperate with Purchaser, to the extent reasonable, in Purchasers
establishment of its own health and welfare and other benefit plans,
including providing Purchaser with copies of existing plan documents, third
party administrator and vendor contracts and other relevant employee data.

  



  

(e) Purchaser shall have in effect as of the Closing Date,  flexible
spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under
Section 125 of the Code (the " _Purchaser Cafeteria Plan_ ") that provide
benefits to U.S. Business

  



        
   

  



  

Employees who had flexible spending reimbursement accounts immediately prior
to the Closing in the Tyco Flexible Spending Accounts Plan, a plan intended
to qualify under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Seller Cafeteria Plan_ "),
and Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-
off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from the Seller Cafeteria
Plan and to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Transferred Employee under
the Seller Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, (A) the Sellers
shall transfer to the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan an amount equal to the net
Purchaser Cafeteria Plan flexible spending account balances with respect
to Transferred Employees, to the extent the aggregate amount of such
account balances is greater than zero or (B) Purchaser shall transfer to
the Sellers an amount equal to the net Purchaser Cafeteria Plan
flexible spending account balances with respect to Transferred Employees, to
the extent the aggregate amount of such account balances is less than zero.
From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be solely
responsible for all claims by Transferred Employees under the Seller
Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the preceding or any other
provision of the Agreement shall be interpreted to interfere with Purchasers
rights to amend or terminate any of the employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by Purchaser or any Purchased Company,
or interpreted as an amendment or other modification of any Business Benefit
Plan.

Bonds that are outstanding as of the Closing Date and are set forth in
Section I of _Schedule 8.8_ , and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds to
be canceled and terminated as of the Closing Date and Parent and its
Affiliates shall have no further obligation or Liability (contingent or
otherwise) under such Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds
from and after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ that if any such
Letter of Credit, Bank Guarantee or Surety Bond cannot be terminated as of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (A) cause such Letter of Credit, Bank
Guarantee and Surety Bond to be cancelled and terminated on or before a date
not later than sixty (60) days from the Closing Date and (B) reimburse Parent
for all payments made by any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller (other than
a Purchased Company or a Subsidiary of a Purchased Company ) following the
Closing with respect to any obligation pursuant to such Letter of Credit,

Date, rather, Sellers shall provide _Schedule 8.8_ (which shall be current as
of a date not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date) to
Purchaser not more than ten (10) but not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing and (ii) Purchaser shall have no responsibility or

Subsidiaries, the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries) for which any

_above, the incremental income Taxes attributable to an applicable election

election applies over (ii) the hypothetical liability for such Taxes had
such election not been made.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Limitations on Indemnification_. Under no circumstance shall
Purchaser, or any Subsidiary thereof, be entitled to indemnification under
this _Section 9.1_ for an NWE Tax Obligation in excess of the
Indemnification Allocation of such NWE Tax Obligation.

  



  

9.2 _Procedures Relating to Tax Indemnification_.

  



  

### (a) If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending audit, shall be
made by any Tax Authority in writing, which, if successful, could result in
an indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 9.1_ (any such claim, a " _Tax
Claim_ "), the party seeking indemnification (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_
") shall notify the other party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing
of the Tax Claim within the shorter of (i) fifteen (15) Business Days after
receipt of such Tax Claim or (ii) a period equal to one half of the number of
Business Days from the date such Tax Claim is received until the first date a
response is due with respect thereto. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given
to the Tax Indemnifying Party within such period or in detail sufficient to
apprise the Tax Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party to the
extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result
thereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Tax Indemnifying Party may, at its election and at its own
expense, control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel) and may either pay the Tax Claim and sue for
a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not
settle or otherwise compromise such Tax Claim (i) without the Tax Indemnified
Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); or (ii) unless the Tax Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the

  

### 

  

### 72   

     
   

  

### 

  

Tax Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) from and against any Liability for
Taxes resulting from such settlement or compromise and such settlement or
compromise does not result in any change in accounting method for Tax
purposes that affects a Post-Closing Tax Period. If the Tax Indemnifying
Party elects to control such Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep
the Tax Indemnified Party informed as to the status of such proceedings
(including by providing copies of all notices received from the relevant Tax
Authority) and the Tax Indemnified Party shall have the right to attend (and,
to the extent that the resolution of such Tax Claim could materially
adversely affect the Liability of the Tax Indemnified Party for Taxes for
which it is not indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, participate in),
using counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, all proceedings
(including meetings and conference calls) relating to any Tax Claim. If the
Tax Indemnifying Party elects not to control any proceedings relating to a
Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnified Party shall control such proceedings but shall
not settle or compromise such Tax Claim without the Tax Indemnifying Partys
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

9.3 _Tax Returns_.

  



  

### (a) Parent and each Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be filed, with respect to all taxable periods, (i)
all Combined Returns (as defined below) and (ii) all Parent Separate Returns
(as defined below); and Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be filed, with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
all Purchased Company Separate Returns (as defined below) that have not been
filed on or before the Closing Date. All such Combined Returns (to the
extent relating to the Purchased Companies, their Subsidiaries or the
Business) and Purchased Company Separate Returns shall be prepared, to the
extent permitted by Law, in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
applicable Purchased Company, and copies thereof (or, in the case of such
Combined Returns, copies of the relevant portions thereof) shall be submitted
to the other party at least 30 days prior to the applicable due date (i) for
review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, if the
other party bears liability for Taxes pursuant to _Section 9.1_ with respect
to such Tax Returns; and (ii) for review and comment, with the
preparing party considering in good faith any reasonable comments thereto, in
each other case. Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable
all Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect to all such
Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are not accrued as a Liability in the
Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to  _Section 2.6_.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers, the Purchased Companies and Purchaser shall, at their own
cost and expense, reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

  

### 

  

### (c) Any refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods of the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries, plus any interest
received with respect thereto from the applicable Tax Authority (including
refunds or credits arising by

  

### 

  

### 73   

     
   

  

### 

  

### reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date) shall be for
the account of Sellers to the extent such Taxes were paid by Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers (including the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date) and shall be paid, net of any
Tax cost to Purchaser and its Affiliates, by Purchaser to Sellers within ten
(10) Business Days after Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives such
refund or after the relevant Tax Return is filed in which the credit is
actually recognized by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, except to the
extent any such refund is reflected as a current asset in the Closing Working
Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.6_.  At Sellers
expense, Purchaser shall, if reasonably requested by Sellers, file for, or
cause to be filed for, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and
expedite the receipt of, any refund to which Sellers are entitled to under
this _Section 9.3(c)_.

  

### 

  

### (d) Within thirty (30) days of the close of a Tax year of Purchaser in
which any current or former officer or employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) of any Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof (i) is
required to include in income any amount as a result of the lapse of any
restriction with respect to shares of Tyco International Ltd. stock issued
pursuant to a Business Benefit Plan, (ii) receives any amount under a Seller
Deferred Compensation Plan, or (iii) exercises any option to purchase stock
of Tyco International Ltd. pursuant to a Business Benefit Plan, Purchaser
shall pay to the applicable Seller (as directed by Parent) an amount (net of
any Tax cost to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) equal to the product of
(x) the gross amount of the deduction allowed or allowable to Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates in computing its liability for Taxes (without regard to
whether such deduction in fact reduces such liability) attributable to or
resulting from the lapse of such restriction, the payment of such amount, or
the exercise of such option and (y) thirty-eight percent (38%); provided,
however, that this Section 9.3(d) shall apply only to lapses of restrictions,
amounts received, or options exercised of this Section 9.3(d) on or before
December 31, 2011. If a Tax Authority disallows or threatens to disallow a
deduction described in this Section 9.3(d), the provisions of Section 9.2
shall apply to such claim and Parent shall be treated as the Tax Indemnifying
Party. If all or a portion of the disallowance is upheld pursuant to a final
settlement with the Tax Authority or by an administrative or judicial
decision from which no appeal can be taken or the time for taking any such
appeal has expired, Parent or the applicable Seller shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to (i) the amount paid by Purchaser to the applicable Seller
with respect to such deduction pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) (plus any
interest or penalties paid by Purchaser with respect to such disallowance)
less (ii) the product of (a) the amount of the deduction allowed, if any, and
(b) thirty-eight percent (38%).

  

### 

  

### (e) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall have made available to Purchaser, at
Purchasers expense, (i) all material federal, state, local, and foreign Tax
Returns of or including the Purchased Companies (and any predecessor of a
Purchased Company) and their Subsidiaries (or in the case of any Combined
Return, the relevant portions thereof) for tax years 2004 through 2006
reasonably requested by Purchaser and within the possession of Sellers or
their Affiliates, and (ii) complete and accurate copies of all material audit
or examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by the Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries since
December 31, 2006.

  

### 

  

### 74   

     
   

  

### 

  

### (f) Solely with respect to U.K. Taxes:

  

### 

  

#### (1) The Purchased Companies and Purchaser shall immediately sign and
make such claims and elections and give such consents (including provisional
or final claims to claim or surrender group relief in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period ) and comply with all procedural requirements in respect
of making or giving of such claims or consents as the Parent or any Affiliate
of Parent, in its absolute discretion, directs in writing.  Neither the
Parent nor any Affiliate of the Parent shall be liable to make any payment to
the Purchaser or any Purchased Company for any group relief surrendered to
any Affiliate of the Parent in accordance with this _Section 9.3(f)_.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) Neither the Purchaser nor Purchased Companies shall do any act or
thing (including in particular the carry back of losses from accounting
periods ending after Closing under section 393A of the Taxes Act 1988 or
section 83 of the Finance Act 1996) after Closing which:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) affect the ability of any Affiliate of the Parent to make claims
for allowances or group relief, to accept surrenders of group relief in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period; or

  

##### 

  

##### (B) would reduce or extinguish any relief or allowance relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

##### 

  

### (g) Neither the Purchaser nor Purchased Companies shall amend,
disregard, withdraw or disclaim any elections, claims or benefits (including
without limitation, elections or claims under section 402 of the Taxes Act
1988 (group relief)) or disclaim or withdraw any initial or writing down
allowances or any other capital allowances in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

  



  

9.4 _Transaction Taxes_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes imposed by or payable to any
jurisdiction or any Governmental Body (collectively, " _Transaction Taxes_ ")
arising from the transactions contemplated by any provision of this Agreement
or in connection with any Ancillary Agreement shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, all value added taxes (including, but not limited to, VAT, GST and
other similar taxes) shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by the
Purchaser. It is the understanding of the parties that the asset sale in
Australia should qualify as a transfer of business and should not be subject
to GST. However, should the Seller be liable to charge and account for GST it
shall issue a valid GST invoice to the Purchaser. All necessary Tax Returns
with respect to all such Transaction Taxes and value added taxes shall be
filed by the party responsible for the filing of any such Tax Returns under
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Transaction Taxes do not include
income Taxes, and the Purchase Price set forth in _Section 2.3_ is exclusive
of any Transaction Taxes and value added taxes payable.

  



         
 

  



  

9.5 _Records Retention_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall retain (or cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to retain) all Tax Returns, schedules, and work
papers and all material records and other documents relating thereto of the
Purchased Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the
expiration of the later of (i) the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing
Date or (ii) the date on which Taxes may no longer be assessed under the
applicable statutes of limitation, including any waivers or extensions
thereof.  Thereafter, each of Parent and Purchaser shall not destroy or
dispose of any such Tax Returns, schedules, or work papers or any other
material records or other documents relating thereto without giving written
notice to the other party of such pending destruction or disposal and
offering such other party the right to copy such documents and information.
 Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be entitled to destroy
or dispose of any such Tax Returns, schedules, and work papers and all
material records and other documents relating thereto described in such
notice if such other party fails to request copies thereof within ninety (90)
days after receipt of the notice described in this _Section 9.5_.

  



  

9.6 _Exclusivity; Dispute Resolution_ . Except with respect to _Sections
13.1(b)_ , _13.1(c)_ , _13.1(d) _and _13.4(a)_ , this _ARTICLE IX_ , and not
_ARTICLE XIII_ , shall govern the administration of all Tax Claims, the
retention of Tax records, and the determination of, procedures for, and all
other matters related to Taxes arising under this Agreement. Any dispute
regarding Taxes arising under this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.6(e)_.

  



  

9.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_ . Sellers shall release or cause the release of
each Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof from any obligation under any
existing agreement relating to the allocation or sharing of Taxes (the " _Tax
Sharing Agreements_ ") to which any Person (other than any other Purchased
Company or Subsidiary thereof) is a party. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
shall cause each Purchased Company and Subsidiary thereof to have no
obligation under any Tax Sharing Agreement to any Person (other than another
Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof) for the payment of Taxes after the
Closing.

  



  

9.8 _FIRPTA Certificate._ Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall have
delivered to Purchaser such forms and certificates, duly executed and
acknowledged, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser,
certifying that the purchase of the Target Shares and the Purchased Assets is
exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

  



  

9.9 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments; Withholding_.  Unless
otherwise required by Law, all payments made pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ or
_ARTICLE XIII_ hereof shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to
the Purchase Price.

  



  

9.10 _Closing of Tax Years; Straddle Period._ To the extent permitted by
Law, Sellers, the Purchased Companies, and/or Purchaser, as applicable, shall
close each taxable period of each Purchased Company as of the close of the
Closing Date.  For purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ , in the case of any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or

  



        
   

  



  

measured by income or receipts of the Purchased Companies for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which a Purchased
Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Purchased Companies for a Straddle
Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period.

  



  

9.11 _Waiver of Loss Carrybacks_. To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, relinquish pursuant to Treasury
Regulation section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign Law), with respect to all net operating losses attributable
to any Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof, the portion of the carryback
period for which such Purchased Company or Subsidiary was a member of a
consolidated group of which Parent or any of its Affiliates is or was the
common parent. To the extent that a Seller or its Subsidiary receives a
refund or actually realizes a credit as a result of the carryback of a Tax
asset of a Purchased Company or Subsidiary thereof arising in a Post-Closing
Tax Period, such Seller or Subsidiary shall pay to Purchaser, within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such refund or after the relevant Tax Return
is filed that reflects such realization, the amount of such refund or credit
(together with any interest received thereon and net of any Tax cost to such
Seller or Subsidiary). At Purchasers expense, the Sellers shall, if
reasonably requested by Purchaser, file for, or cause to be filed for, and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of, any
refund to which Purchaser is entitled to under this _Section 9.11_.

  



  

9.12 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  



  

(a) At the request of Sellers, which request shall be made in writing no
later than the Closing Date, Purchaser shall join with Sellers (or an
appropriate Affiliate of a Seller) in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and any
corresponding or similar elections under U.S. state or local Tax laws
(collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_") with respect to the
purchase and sale of any Target Shares hereunder. In the event that Sellers do
not request that Purchaser join in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 9.12_ shall not apply

  



  

(b) Sellers shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms
and documents required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
subject to prior review and approval by Purchaser and the procedures set
forth in this _Section 9.12_. For the purpose of making the Section
338(h)(10) Election, on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall execute
two copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or successor form) with
respect to the sale of the applicable Target Shares. Purchaser shall execute
(or cause to be executed) and deliver to Sellers such additional documents or
forms as are reasonably requested to complete properly the Section 338(h)(10)
Election at

  



        
   

  



  

least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is
required to be filed.

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to
Purchaser an allocation of the purchase price for the Target Shares for which
Sellers have exercised their rights under _Section 9.12(a) _(and any
liabilities of the Purchased Company existing immediately after the Closing)
for purposes of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Sellers shall prepare the
allocation in a manner consistent with the allocation method set forth in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6. Unless Purchaser notifies Sellers in
writing that it disagrees with the allocation within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt thereof, the allocation shall be conclusive and binding on
Purchaser and Sellers. If Purchaser notifies Sellers in writing of its
disagreement with the allocation within such ten (10) Business Day period,
then Purchaser and Sellers shall attempt to resolve their differences with
respect thereto within thirty (30) days after such Sellers receipt
of Purchasers written notice of disagreement.  Any dispute regarding the
allocation not resolved by Purchaser and Sellers within such thirty (30) day
period will be resolved by an Accounting Firm mutually acceptable to both
parties or, in the absence of agreement, by an accounting firm of national
reputation selected by lot after eliminating Sellers and Purchasers
principal outside accountants and one additional firm designated as
objectionable by each of Sellers and Purchaser. The determination by the
Accounting Firm so selected of the allocation shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm in acting
under this _Section 9.12(c) _shall be shared equally by Purchaser and
Sellers.  Purchaser and Sellers shall file, and shall cause their Affiliates
to file, all Tax Returns (and all statements, forms, and schedules in
connection therewith) in a manner consistent with such allocation and with
the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary thereto
unless required to do so under applicable Law

  



  

(d) To the extent permitted by U.S. state or local Tax Law, the principles
and procedures of this _Section 9.12_ shall also apply with respect to a
Section 338(h)(10) Election or equivalent or comparable provision under U.S.
state or local Law.

Competing Person; or

  

### 

  

### (b) solicit away, divert or attempt to solicit away or divert from doing
business (with respect to the Business) with Purchaser or any of its

Person who was a customer or supplier of the Business at any time during the
two (2) years prior to the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 12.1_ shall (i) prevent Parent, any Seller or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from selling or divesting any or all of its assets or
businesses to any Person that is not an Affiliate of Parent or a Seller, and
such Person shall in no way be bound by the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 12.1_ or (ii) prohibit Parent, any Seller or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from acquiring the whole or any part of a Person
which engages in any Competitive Activity in any of the Restricted Areas or

or generated less than $200,000,000 of revenues within the last twelve (12)
months for of such Person or business acquired as set out in the latest
available annual financial statements of that Person or business.

  



  

12.2 _Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

### (a) Parent and each Seller agrees that from and after the date of this
Agreement until eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Non-
Solicitation Period_ "), it shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, directly or indirectly, request or induce any person who is either at
any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date employed
primarily in connection with the Business or is employed by Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries to terminate his or her employment with the Business,
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Purchased Companies), or hire during the Non-Solicitation Period any such
employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply (i) to
solicitations made by job opportunity advertisements and headhunter searches
directed to the general public rather than

  

### 

  

### 84   

     
   

  

### 

  

### targeting any employees of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries and, with
respect to all employees other than senior management of the Business
as conducted by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, the hiring of such employees
or (ii) with respect to any employee who has been terminated by such other
party prior to (or has voluntarily left his or her employment more than six
months prior to) such solicitation or hiring.

  

### 

  

### (b) Purchaser agrees that during the Non-Solicitation Period, it shall
not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
request or induce any person who is at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date employed in the Excluded Businesses (other than

Excluded Businesses, or hire during the Non-Solicitation Period any such

terminated by such other party prior to (or has voluntarily left his or her

### 

  

12.3 _Specific Performance_. Parent, Sellers and Purchaser recognize and
affirm that in the event of breach by it or any of its Subsidiaries of any of
the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ , money damages would be inadequate and
the other party would have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Parent,
Sellers and Purchaser agree that the other party shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce
its rights and the other partys obligations under this _ARTICLE XII_ not
only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order
to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or
future) of the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_. In the event of a breach or
violation by Parent, a Seller or Purchaser of any of the provisions of this
_ARTICLE XII_ , the Non-Competition Period or Non-Solicitation Period, as
applicable, shall be extended by a period equal to (i) the length of the
breach or violation of this _ARTICLE XII_ plus (ii) the length of any court
proceedings necessary to stop such breach or violation. Parent, Sellers and
Purchaser agree that the other party is not required to post a bond in order
for the other party to secure an injunction.

  



  

12.4 _Severability_. If at any time any of the provisions of this
_ARTICLE XII_ shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of
being vague or unreasonable as to duration, area or  scope of activity, or
otherwise, then this _ARTICLE XII_ shall be considered divisible (with the
other provisions to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or
unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended
to include only such time, area, scope of activity and other restrictions, as
shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other
body having jurisdiction over the matter, and Parent and each Seller
expressly agrees that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be valid and
binding as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not
been included herein. Without limiting the foregoing, if the length of the
Non-Competition Period is determined to be unacceptable under

  



         
 

  



  

applicable Law, the Non-Competition Period shall be modified as determined by
a court or other agency of competent jurisdiction or statute, as applicable,
to be of the maximum length permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

12.5 _Use of Trade Names and Trade Marks_

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, after the Closing, Purchaser shall
(and shall cause Purchasers Affiliates to) refrain from using any of the
Excluded Sellers IP, and any other Intellectual Property Rights of Sellers
or their Subsidiaries not specifically acquired hereunder (including by the
acquisition of the Purchased Companies by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries).
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall
(and shall cause Purchasers Affiliates to) specifically refrain from using
in any manner the name "Tyco", or any variation, derivation, or translation
thereof, or any name likely to cause confusion with or dilute such name. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall limit Purchaser from
using the name "Earth Tech".

  



  

(b) As soon as practical after the Closing, but in no event later than 45
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (and shall cause Purchasers
Affiliates to), to the extent commercially reasonable and practicable, remove
or render illegible all references to the "Tyco" name, or any variation
thereof or any related mark or logo, appearing on any sales, marketing and
shipping materials, and any other goods purchased and acquired hereunder;
provided that if such removal or rendering illegible would cause such sales,
marketing and shipping materials or such other goods to become unusable, or
is otherwise not commercially reasonable and practicable, Purchaser (or
Purchasers Affiliates) shall be entitled to use such sales, marketing and
shipping materials or such other goods in the ordinary course of Purchasers
business for a period of three (3) consecutive months following the Closing
Date without modifying such references. Any use of the "Tyco" name by
Purchaser (or Purchasers Affiliates) pursuant to this _Section 12.5(b)
_shall: (i) be in conformity with the practices of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, (ii) be in a manner that does not in any
way harm or disparage Sellers or their Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of the "Tyco" name, and (iii) be contingent on Purchaser (or
Purchasers Affiliates) maintaining the quality of goods and services used in
connection with the "Tyco" name at a standard at least as high as that of the
goods and services offered and sold by Sellers and their Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the "Tyco" name is not owned by
Sellers, but is licensed to Tyco International Services Holding GmbH by Tyco
International Services GmbH pursuant to that certain License Agreement, dated
June 29, 2007, a copy of which has been provided to Purchaser (the " _License
Agreement_ "). Any use of the "Tyco" name by Purchaser (or Purchasers
Affiliates) as permitted hereunder is expressly conditioned upon compliance
by Purchaser (and Purchasers Affiliates) with the relevant provisions of
that certain License Agreement applicable to Tyco International Services
Holding GmbH. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and without
expanding any right granted to Purchaser and its Affiliates in _Section
12.5(b)_, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement (as
such terms

  



        
   

  



  

relate to Purchasers and its Affiliates use of the "Tyco" name) and the
terms of the License Agreement, the terms of the License Agreement shall
control.

  



  

(d) As soon as practical after the Closing, but in no event later than one-
hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall (and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to) take all required action, including the
filing of an amendment to any certificates of incorporation, to change any
name of Sellers or their Subsidiaries, if applicable, to a name that does not
include the phrase "Earth Tech", or a phrase confusingly similar thereto.
 During such one-hundred and twenty-day period, Sellers and
their Subsidiaries shall be entitled to continue using any sales, marketing
and shipping materials, and to sell off existing inventory of products, that
bear the "Earth Tech" name. Any use of the "Earth Tech" name by Sellers or
their Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 12.5(d) _shall: (i) be in
conformity with the practices of Sellers and their Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date, (ii) be in a manner that does not in any way harm or disparage
the reputation or goodwill of the "Earth Tech" name, and (iii) be contingent
on Sellers and their Subsidiaries maintaining the quality of goods and
services used in connection with the "Earth Tech" name at a standard at least
as high as that of the goods and services offered and sold by Sellers
and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

  



  

 **ARTICLE XIII 
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

13.1 _Losses Defined._

  



  

### (a) The term "Losses" shall mean and include any and all Liabilities,
losses, damages, Claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
the expenses of investigation and litigation), settlement, award, costs,
fines, fees, penalties, breaches, obligations, injuries or other expense of
any nature, whether or not involving a Proceeding, including costs of
defending any Proceeding or enforcing an Indemnified Partys rights
hereunder. "Losses" shall not include special, incidental or consequential
damages (other than consequential or incidental damages payable to a third
party), including lost profits or loss of business opportunity.

  

### (b) If the Indemnified Party actually recognizes a Tax Benefit on
account of a Loss or Tax subject to indemnification under this _ARTICLE XIII_
or _ARTICLE IX_ at any time not later than two (2) years after an
indemnification payment is made to the Indemnified Party in respect of such
Loss or Tax (as applicable), then, to the extent of the amount of such
indemnification payment, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such
Tax Benefit (net of any Tax cost to the Indemnified Party) at such time or
times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually recognized by
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party actually incurs any
additional Tax cost arising from the receipt of the indemnity payments
hereunder at any time within two (2) years after an indemnification payment
is made to the Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss or Tax (as
applicable), the Indemnifying Party shall promptly make an additional
indemnification payment to the Indemnified Party in the amount of such Tax
cost. As used in this _Section 13.1_, "Tax Benefit" shall mean any refund of
Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which

  



        
   

  



  

### otherwise would be paid (less the costs of recovery of such refund
or reduction to the Indemnified Party), in each case calculated on a with
and without basis.

  



  

### (c) The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under all insurance policies and/or indemnification agreements
covering any indemnifiable Loss or Tax (as applicable) to the same extent as
the Indemnified Party would if such Loss or Tax were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery
is made at any time within two (2) years of an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to any Loss or Tax (as applicable), then, to
the extent of the amount of such indemnification payment, a refund equal to
the aggregate net amount of the recovery (less the costs of recovery to the
Indemnified Party, including any increase in premiums or similar costs) shall
be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity
payment to such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated
to all rights of any Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses or
Taxes indemnified by such Indemnifying Party.

  



  

### (d) In computing the amount of any Tax cost or Tax Benefit pursuant to
this _Section 13.1_, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any
item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any and all Losses or Taxes (as applicable). For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 13.1_ shall not be construed to grant
the Indemnifying Party any right to review the Tax Returns of the
Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

13.2 _Indemnification by Parent and Sellers_. Subject to the other terms,
conditions and limitations of this Agreement (including the provisions of
_Sections 13.4_ and _13.5_ ), Parent and Sellers agree to jointly and
severally indemnify Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries) (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ")
against, and to hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless from, all
Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to
the extent arising out of or related to:

  



  

### (a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by Parent in _ARTICLE IV_  of this Agreement or in the
Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Closing
(in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if all
qualifications as to knowledge and materiality (including any qualifications
as to Material Adverse Effect) were deleted therefrom);

  



  

### (b) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by a Seller in _ARTICLE V_ or _ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement
(other than any representation or warranty made in _Section 5.8_ (Taxes) for
which indemnification is set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ ) or in the Ancillary
Agreements or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto to be
true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Closing (in each case,
as such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications as
to knowledge and materiality were deleted therefrom);

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) any Excluded Liabilities;

  



  

### (d) any failure by Sellers or Parent to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.

  



  

13.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Purchaser agrees, subject to the other
terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement (including the provisions
of _Sections 13.4_ and _13.5_ ), to indemnify Parent, Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and
hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from, all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out
of or related to:

  



  

### (a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by Purchaser in _ARTICLE VII_  of this Agreement or in the
Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Closing
(in each case, as such representation or warranty would read if all
qualifications as to knowledge and materiality (including any qualifications
as to Material Adverse Effect) were deleted therefrom);

  



  

### (b) any failure by Purchaser to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements or in any

13.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_

  



  

### (a) The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and
the right to assert a claim for indemnification with respect thereto pursuant
to _Sections 13.2(a)_, _13.2(b) _or  _13.3(a)_ , shall survive the Closing
until fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date and shall thereafter be of
no further force of effect; _provided_  that (i) the representations and
warranties in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.5_ ,  _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ , _6.1_ , _6.2_

### 

  

### 89   

     
   

  

### 

  

### warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of
the matter covered by such notice. No Claim for indemnification under

the applicable survival period.

  



  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) an
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Sections
13.2(a)_, _13.2(b) _or _13.3(a) _(except with respect to Claims for
indemnification related to the Surviving Representations) (collectively, the
" _Misrepresentation Claims_ ") until such party (together with its
Affiliates) shall have incurred, (i) with respect to any particular Claim or
series of similar claims arising out of the same facts or circumstances, an
indemnifiable Loss in excess of Two-Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000)
(such amount, the " _Minimum Per Claim Amount_ "), in which event the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to count the entire amount of such
indemnifiable Loss towards the Deductible, and (ii) as to all Claims,
indemnifiable Losses in excess of two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price in
the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ ") and (B) under no circumstance shall any
Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification, or otherwise be
entitled to assert a Claim for indemnification, for an NWE Loss in excess of
the Indemnification Allocation of such NWE Loss.

  



  

### (c) An Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless any Indemnified Party with respect to the matters covered by
_Sections 13.2(a)_, _13.2(b) _or _13.3(a)_ , only to the extent the
aggregate amount of Losses incurred and asserted by such Indemnified Party
exceeds the Deductible and then only to the extent of such amount that is in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ _that_ no individual Loss or series of
related Losses shall be so asserted unless and until the aggregate amount
that would be payable pursuant to each such Loss or series of related Losses
exceeds an amount equal to the Minimum Per Claim Amount (it being understood
that any such individual Losses or series of related Losses for amounts less
than the Minimum Per Claim Amount shall be ignored in determining whether the
Deductible has been exceeded). Under no circumstance shall Parents
and Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchasers, on the other hand,
aggregate obligation to provide indemnification for matters covered by
_Sections 13.2(a)_,  _13.2(b) _or _13.3(a) _(except with respect to Claims
for indemnification related to the Surviving Representations) exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the Purchase Price.

  



  

### (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, there shall be no right to indemnification hereunder for any Losses
to the extent that such Losses were taken into account in the final
determination of Closing Working Capital, Closing Business Debt, Change of
Control Payments, Closing Transaction Expenses, Project Contributions,
Chinese DBFO Proceeds, Dalriada DBFO Proceeds or Other DBFO Proceeds pursuant
to _Section 2.6_.  Except for any Claims (i) seeking equitable relief in
connection with the failure of a party to perform its covenants hereunder or
under the Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) a party may have under the express
terms of any

  

### 

  

### 90   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Ancillary Agreement (other than one purporting solely to convey assets),
from and after the Closing, subject to _Section 8.12_ and _ARTICLE IX_ ,
this _ARTICLE XIII_ constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy of all parties
for any and all monetary Losses or other claims relating to or arising from
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

### (e) Each party shall take, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to take,
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all indemnifiable Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give
rise to indemnifiable Losses.

  



  

### (f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses or Taxes
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent such Indemnified Party (or other Purchaser Indemnified Parties in the
event of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or other Seller Indemnified Parties
in the event of a Seller Indemnified Party) had already recovered Losses with
respect to such matter pursuant to that or other provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

### (g) Notwithstanding any provision herein contained to the contrary, the
Liability of each party under this _ARTICLE XIII_ shall be in addition to,
and not exclusive of, any other Liability that such party may have at law or
equity based on such partys fraudulent acts or fraudulent omissions. None of
the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by
the Indemnified Parties of any right or remedy which they may have at law or
equity based on another partys fraudulent acts or fraudulent omissions, nor
shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of
recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud, (ii) the time period
during which a claim for fraud may be brought, or (iii) the recourse which
the Indemnified Parties may seek against the Indemnifying Parties with
respect to a claim for fraud; _provided_ _that_ the Indemnified Parties
hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law the remedy
of rescission.

  



  

### (h) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in
respect of an inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty, or the
breach of a covenant or agreement set forth in _Section 8.4(e)(i)_, shall
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant
to this _Section 13.4_,  _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as
to which the party to be indemnified shall have, prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period, previously made a claim to the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with _Section 13.5_.

  



  

13.5 _Procedures for Indemnification._

  



  

### (a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section 13.2_
or _Section 13.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall notify the party
against whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the
claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation, demand or other Claim against the Indemnified
Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing

  

### 

  

### 91   

     
   

  

### 

  

### the Third Party Claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and
the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such written notice, an "
_Indemnification Notice_ "); _provided_ that the failure to so notify an
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that)
such failure shall have caused the indemnifiable Losses to be greater than
such Losses would have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying
Party prompt notice hereunder.

  



  

### (b) Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Partys expense, and
at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to be the
lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that such assumption
of the defense shall be deemed to constitute an admission of Liability with
respect to the Third Party Claim for the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ _further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose ( _provided_ that the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and shall not be
recoverable from such Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE XIII_ ).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Third Party Claim is primarily for
non-monetary damages against the Indemnified Party or seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief that, if granted, would reasonably be expected to be
material to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have
determined in good faith that an actual or potential conflict of interest
makes representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by
the same counsel or the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
inappropriate, (iii) the Third Party Claim is by a customer or supplier, the
loss of the commercial relationship with whom would be materially adverse to
the Business, or (iv) the Third Party Claim is a criminal Proceeding, then in
each case the Indemnified Party may, upon notice to the Indemnifying Party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise and settle such Third Party
Claim and the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys
separate counsel shall be borne (A) in the case of (i) and (iv) above, by the
Indemnifying Party to the extent the Third Party Claim is indemnifiable
hereunder (but only to the extent such separate counsel agrees to comply with
any written guidelines established by the Indemnifying Party that are
applicable to substantially all outside counsel retained by such Indemnifying
Party, which guidelines shall be provided to the Indemnified Party promptly
upon the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Indemnified Partys
assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim) and (B) in the case of
(ii) and (iii) above, by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

### (c) Upon assumption of the defense of any such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid,
any part of the Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in
writing to such payment or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may
be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle, or
admit any Liability with respect to, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the relief consists solely of (i)
money damages

  

### 

  

### 92   

     
   

  

### 

  

### (all of which the Indemnifying Party shall pay), and (ii) includes a
provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases
the Indemnified Party from all Liability with respect thereto.

  



  

### (d) In all cases, the Indemnified Party shall provide its reasonable
cooperation with the Indemnifying Party in defense of claims or litigation,
including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably
available. If the Indemnifying Party shall not reasonably promptly assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, or fails to prosecute or withdraws
(such failure to prosecute or withdrawal shall not effect the admission of
liability based on the assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim)
from the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
defend against such matter in a manner consistent with the above provisions
regarding conduct of the defense by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
the Indemnified Party may not settle any such matter without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  



  

### (e) In the event that any party or any of its Subsidiaries alleges that
it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, and that its Claim is covered
under more than one provision of this _ARTICLE XIII_ , such party or
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to elect the provision or provisions under
which it may bring a claim for indemnification.

  



  

### (f) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third
Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought.

  



  

 **ARTICLE XIV 
 TERMINATION AND WAIVER**

  



  

14.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

  



  

### (a) at any time prior to the Closing by the mutual written consent of
Parent, Sellers and Purchaser;

  

### 

  

### (b) By Purchaser, by written notice to Parent if any event shall have
occurred as a result of which any condition set forth in _Section 10.2_ is
no longer capable of being satisfied (which termination shall take effect ten
(10) days following such notice); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the
breach or obligation is curable through the use of commercially reasonable
efforts within the thirty (30) day period after Purchaser notifies Parent of
such breach, then Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 14.1(b) _prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period.
 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 14.1(b) _shall not be
available to Purchaser if such condition became incapable of fulfillment due
to its breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
under this Agreement or if the breach by Sellers is cured within the thirty
(30) day period;

  



  

### (c) By Parent and Sellers, by written notice to Purchaser if any event
shall have occurred as a result of which any condition set forth in _Section
10.1_ is no longer capable of being satisfied (which termination shall take
effect 10 days following such

  

### 

  

### 93   

     
   

  

### 

  

### notice); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 14.1(c) _shall not be available
to Parent and Sellers if such condition became incapable of fulfillment due
to its breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under
this Agreement; or

  



  

### (d) By Purchaser or by Parent, upon written notice to the other party, if
the Closing has not occurred on or prior to December 31, 2008, _provided_
that such date shall be extended to March 31, 2009 if the waiting periods and
clearances pursuant to the HSR Act or any Competition Laws shall not have
unconditionally expired, been terminated or been obtained prior to December
31, 2008; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 14.1(d) _shall not be available to any party if the
failure of such party to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement
caused the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date.

  



  

14.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination in accordance with
_Section 14.1_, this Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be
no Liability on the part of any party hereto, except _Sections 8.5_,  _8.10_
, this _14.2_ and _ARTICLE XV_ shall survive termination; provided, however,
that nothing in this _Section 14.2_ shall relieve any party from Liability
for Losses caused by breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination.

  



  

 **ARTICLE XV 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  



  

15.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this

Section 13. _Standby Letter of Credit_. Following the occurrence of any

its obligations hereunder. Purchaser shall be obligated to maintain the
letter of credit until the unconditional release, expiration or termination

scheduled expiration date of the letter of credit, an irrevocable written
commitment to renew the letter of credit or to issue a replacement letter of
credit, Parent shall be entitled to draw an amount under the letter of credit

other Person.

  



  

Section 15. _Defense of Claims and Cooperation_. Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in the defense of all claims brought by any Beneficiary
in connection with any Obligation.  In the event that Purchaser (a) gives
notice to Parent that it would be liable to Parent under the provisions
hereof for indemnity if such claim is successful and (b) that it disputes and
intends to defend such claim at its own cost and expense, and (c) that it
will fully and promptly indemnify Parent against all expenses, costs, and
other liabilities relating to such claim and, provided that Parent will not
be required to incur any cost or expense with respect to the defense of such
claim, then Purchaser, at its option, shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof. Parent and Parents Subsidiaries agree to provide their
reasonable cooperation with Purchaser in defense of such claims, including
with respect to any defenses Parent or Parents Subsidiaries have against
such claims and by making employees, information and documentation reasonably
available; provided, however, that Parent and Parents Subsidiaries shall not
be required to pay or commit to pay (or incur any obligation) other than
nominal filing or application fees and the expenses of Parent or Parents
Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 16. _Remedies_. Parent shall be entitled to pursue any and all
remedies available at law or in equity in connection with any failure
by Purchaser to make any payment when due under this Agreement or any other
breach of the terms of this Agreement (regardless of whether such failure or
breach constitutes an Event of Default).

  



  

Section 17. _Waiver_. No delay, extension of time, renewal, compromise, or
other indulgence which may occur or be granted by Parent under this Agreement
from time to time shall impair Parents rights or powers under this
Agreement. Parent shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights under
this Agreement, unless Parent shall have signed such a waiver in writing.
 No such written waiver shall be effective as to any transactions or
events of default occurring subsequent to the date of such waiver unless
expressly so provided therein.

  



  

Section 18. _Severability._ Any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, shall be, only as to
such jurisdiction ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability, but all of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain valid.

  



  

Section 19. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by Purchaser
without the prior written consent of Parent provided, however, Purchaser may,
without obtaining the prior written consent of Parent or
Parents Subsidiaries, assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate or Subsidiary of Purchaser
(so long as Purchaser remains obligated for the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement).

  



  

Section 20. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR CONTEMPLATED HEREIN AND

certificate limit, multiplied by the percentage specified in section 116(5)

form attached hereto as Schedule B, release from the Withheld Amount to
Purchaser the amount required to be remitted pursuant to section 116(5) of

(3) If, following the Closing Date, the Canada Revenue Agency indicates that
either a certificate under section 116(2) of the Tax Act with a certificate
limit in an amount which is not less than the portion of the Base Purchase
Price allocable to the Shares or a certificate under section 116(4) of the
Tax Act will be issued in respect of the disposition of the Shares by Seller
to Purchaser upon the payment of an amount (the " **Tax Amount** ") that
does not exceed the Withheld Amount, then the Escrow Agent shall,
upon receiving a direction from Seller and Purchaser to the Escrow Agent,
executed by Seller and Purchaser substantially in the form attached hereto as
Schedule B, remit the Tax Amount to the Receiver General for Canada as
payment of the Tax Amount (and the amount so remitted will be credited to

the Purchase Price). Upon delivery by Seller (with a copy thereof to
Purchaser) of a photocopy of such certificate issued under either section
116(2) or 116(4) together with wire transfer instructions, the Escrow Agent
shall release to Seller in accordance with such wire transfer instructions
the Withheld Amount less the Tax Amount. If, prior to the Deadline,
Seller shall fail to deliver a photocopy of such certificate issued under
either section 116(2) or 116(4), the Escrow Agent shall, upon receiving

amount withheld by Purchaser on any additional payment made pursuant to
Section 2.6 of the Purchase Agreement that is allocable to the acquisition of
the shares of Earth Tech (Canada) Inc. beyond the Initial Allocation as
referenced in Section 2.7 of the Purchase Agreement. For greater certainty,
the definition of "Deadline" in this Agreement in respect of such additional
withheld amount shall be read as if the Closing Date is the date that such
additional payment is made.

  



  

 **5.2 Directions.**

  

 ** **

  

The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to make any determination as to the
validity of any direction.

  

 ** **

  

 **SECTION 6  ESCROW AGENT**

  

 ** **

  

 **6.1 General.**

  

 ** **

  

The Escrow Agent agrees to hold and deal with the Withheld Amount in
accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.2 Duties and Liabilities of Escrow Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

(1) **_Liability._** The Escrow Agent shall not be liable or answerable for
anything whatsoever in connection with this Agreement or any instrument or
agreement required hereunder, including enforcement of this Agreement or any
such instrument or agreement, _except_  for its own wilful misconduct or
gross negligence, and the Escrow Agent shall not have any duty or obligation
other than those expressly provided herein. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall not
have any liability to Seller or Purchaser in respect of the deposit or
investment of the Withheld Amount in accordance with this Agreement,
including without limitation, the nature of the deposit or investment, the
income or interest received in connection therewith and the term to maturity
thereof.

  



  

(2) **_Other Agreements._** The Escrow Agent shall only be bound to act as
set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall not be bound in
any way by any agreement or contract between Seller and Purchaser (whether or
not such Escrow Agent has any knowledge thereof), including the Purchase
Agreement.

  



  



         
 

  

(3) **_Directions and Court Orders._** The Escrow Agent shall comply with
such notices, directions and instructions as are provided for in this
Agreement and any order, judgement or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction. If any part or all of the Withheld Amount held in escrow by the
Escrow Agent is at any time attached or seized under any court order or in
case any judicial order, judgement or decree shall be made affecting this
Agreement or any part hereof then, in any such event, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to rely upon and comply with such order, judgement or decree, and
in the case of such compliance, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable by
reason thereof to Seller or Purchaser or to any other person even if
thereafter any such order, judgement or decree is reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated. The Escrow Agent is not bound to enquire into
the authority of any person signing any certificates, instructions,
directions or orders hereunder.

  



  

 ** _(4) _****_Reliance on Experts._** The Escrow Agent may employ such
counsel of its choosing as it may reasonably deem necessary for the proper
discharge of its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent may, in relation to its
obligations hereunder, act on the opinion, advice or information obtained
from such counsel, but shall not be bound to act upon such opinion, advice or
information and shall not be held responsible for any loss occasioned for so
acting or not so acting, as the case may be, except if such loss results from
the wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent may employ such assistance as may be reasonably necessary to properly
discharge its duties.

  



  

(5) **_Other Reliance._** The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
instrument or agreement required hereunder and upon statements
and communications received jointly from Seller and Purchaser (or from any
other person) believed by it to be authentic, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted in good faith on such reliance.

  



  

 **6.3 Disputes.**

  

 ** **

  

Should any controversy arise with respect to the Escrow Agents duties
hereunder or under any other matter related to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent may, at the expense of the other parties, apply to a Judge of a court
of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action contemplated by
this Agreement in the event that it becomes aware of any disagreement between
the parties hereto as to any facts or as to the happening of any contemplated
event precedent to such action. Purchaser and Seller further agree to pursue
any redress or recourse in connection with such a dispute, without making the
Escrow Agent a party to same.

  



  

 **6.4 Resignation of Escrow Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

The Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving fifteen (15) days notice in
writing to Seller and Purchaser.

  



  

 **6.5 Removal of Escrow Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

Seller and Purchaser, acting jointly, may at any time remove such Escrow
Agent from its role as Escrow Agent hereunder on seven days written notice to
that Escrow Agent.

  

 ** **

        
   

  



  

 **6.6 Appointment of New Escrow Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

If the Escrow Agent gives notice of resignation under Section 6.4 or is
removed under Section 6.5, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly appoint a new
escrow agent.

  



  

 **6.7 Failure to Appoint Replacement Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

Upon the effective date of resignation or removal of an Escrow Agent pursuant
to Section 6.4 or 6.5, as the case may be, if a successor Escrow Agent has
not been appointed, then on notice to Seller and Purchaser, the Escrow Agent
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent; failing such application to such court within 30 days
from the effective date of such resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent, on
notice to Seller and Purchaser, may deposit the Withheld Amount (or provide
control thereof if invested)

  



  

and all related records and documents with a court of competent jurisdiction
pending the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the duties and
obligation of such Escrow Agent hereunder shall thereupon cease.

  



  

 **6.8 New Escrow Agent.**

  



  

Any new escrow agent shall agree in writing to be bound by this Agreement and
thereupon shall be vested with the same powers and rights and shall be
subject to the same duties and obligations as if it had executed this
Agreement as the Escrow Agent and, unless otherwise directed in writing
jointly by Seller and Purchaser, and upon satisfaction of all of its fees and
expenses, the former Escrow Agent shall cause to be delivered the Withheld
Amount (or control thereof if invested) and all related records and documents
to the new Escrow Agent, execute all such transfers and other documents and
do all such other acts and things as the new Escrow Agent may reasonably
request for the purpose of giving effect thereto.

  



  

 **6.9 No Agency.**

  



  

Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is acting solely as
depositary at their request and for their convenience and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein contained, the Escrow Agent shall not be
deemed to be the agent of Seller or Purchaser except as otherwise expressly
provided herein.

  



  

 **6.10 Indemnity.**

  



  

(1) Seller and Purchaser agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses and disbursement, including legal or
adviser fees and disbursements of whatever kind and nature (collectively, "
**Losses** ") which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Escrow Agent, whether groundless or otherwise, arising from or
out of any act, omission or error of the Escrow Agent made in the conduct of
its duties hereunder; _provided_ that Seller or Purchaser shall not be
required to indemnify the Escrow Agent against Losses arising out of and from
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Escrow Agent or any
agent employed by the Escrow Agent in carrying out its obligations hereunder.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

  



        
   

  



  

ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (i) DAMAGES OR
EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN
DAMAGES WHICH RESULT FROM THE ESCROW AGENTS FAILURE TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR (ii) SPECIAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This provision shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.11 Discharge from Duties.**

  



  

(1) **_Disposal of Funds._** Upon disposing of all of the Withheld Amount in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be
relieved and discharged from all claims and liabilities relating to the
Withheld Amount and the Escrow Agent shall not be subject to any claims made
by or on behalf of any party hereto except claims relating to the negligence
or wilful misconduct of the Escrow Agent or any agent employed by the Escrow
Agent in carrying out its obligations hereunder.

  



  

(2) **_Removal on Resignation._** Upon resigning or being removed pursuant to
Section 6.4 or 6.5, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Withheld Amount and
any interest or other income earned thereon to the new escrow agent appointed
pursuant to Section 6.6 and the Escrow Agent shall, upon such distribution,
be discharged from all further duties and obligations hereunder and shall not
be subject to any claims made by or on behalf of any party hereto except
claims relating to the negligence or wilful misconduct of the Escrow Agent or
any agent employed by the Escrow Agent in carrying out its obligations
hereunder.

  



  

 **6.12 Expenses.**

  



  

The reasonable fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne by
Seller. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon
any property, cash, or assets of the Escrow Fund, with respect to its unpaid
fees and non-reimbursed expenses, superior to the interests of any other
persons or entities. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled and is hereby
granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees and/or non-reimbursed
expenses from amounts on deposit in the Escrow Fund.

  



  

 **6.13 Waiver of Claims.**

  

 ** **

  

Each party hereto waives any claims or demands against the Escrow Agent and
its principals with respect to all acts taken by such Escrow Agent in
conformance with this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not have any duty
to take any action other than as specifically provided for in this Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any non-action if such
action has been restrained by any order of any court or administrative agency
or if, in its sole discretion, it determines that any such action would
violate any law or governmental regulation.

  

 ** **

        
   

  



  

 **6.14 Consolidation of Escrow Agent.**

  

 ** **

  

Any banking association, corporation, partnership or other entity into which
the Escrow Agent may be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may
be consolidated, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agents rights, obligations
and immunities hereunder without the

  



  

execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

  



  

 **SECTION 7  MISCELLANEOUS**

Agreement.
