| 

(b) Determination of Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be
estimated and finally determined as follows:

(i) Closing Date Estimate. No later than four (4) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") containing the Company's good faith estimates
of the amounts of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital
and Seller Expenses together with calculations of the Merger Consideration
(the "Estimated Merger Consideration") and the Estimated Price Per Share based
on such estimates, together with such schedules and data with respect to the
determination the foregoing estimates as is reasonably necessary to support
such Estimated Closing Statement. The Estimated Closing Statement and all
amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with Section 2.10(c). The Company shall
consider in good faith any revisions to the calculations set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement proposed by Parent, and the Estimated Closing
Statement shall be modified to reflect any revisions agreed upon by the
Company in its sole discretion.

(ii) Post-Closing Adjustment.

(A) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be prepared and, as
soon as practical, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, shall cause to be delivered to the Representative, a statement
(the "Closing Statement") containing the actual amounts of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Seller Expenses, together
with a calculation of the Merger Consideration based on such amounts and such
schedules and data with respect to the determination thereof as is reasonably
necessary to support such Closing Statement. The Closing Statement and all
amounts, estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with Section 2.10(c).

(B) If the Representative disagrees in whole or in part with the Closing
Statement, then prior to the later of (i) the thirtieth (30th) day after its
receipt of the Closing Statement and (ii) the third (3rd) Business Day after
Parent has granted the Representative access to any properties, books,
contracts, personnel, representatives and records in accordance with Section
2.10(b)(ii)(D) (provided that any request for such access shall be made by the
Representative within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the Closing
Statement) (the "Representative Review Period"), the Representative shall
notify Parent of such disagreement in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement"),
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of any such disagreement.
To be effective, any such Notice of Disagreement shall include a copy of
Parent's Closing Statement marked to indicate the specific line items of the
Closing Statement that are in dispute (the "Disputed Line Items") and shall be
accompanied by the Representative's calculation of each of the Disputed Line
Items and the Representative's revised Closing Statement setting forth its
determination of Merger Consideration and any component thereof, as the case
may be. All items that are not Disputed Line Items shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder unless the resolution of a Disputed Line
Item affects an undisputed item, in which case such undisputed item shall
remain open and be considered a Disputed Line Item to the extent of such
corresponding effect. In the event that the Representative does not provide a
Notice of Disagreement prior to the expiration of the Representative Review
Period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full the
Closing Statement as prepared by Parent, and such Closing Statement shall
become final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder as of 5:00
P.M. EST on the final day of the Representative Review Period. In the event
any Notice of Disagreement is properly and timely provided, Parent and the
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any Disputed Line Items. During such 15-day period, Parent and the
Representative shall cooperate with each other and shall have reasonable
access to the personnel, books and records, working papers, schedules and
calculations of the other used in the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the Notice of Disagreement and the determination of the Merger Consideration
and Disputed Line Items in accordance with Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D). All
Disputed Line Items agreed to in writing by Parent and the Representative
during such 15-day period shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties and not subject to further appeal. If, at the end of such period,
Parent and the Representative are unable to resolve all such Disputed Line
Items, then any such remaining Disputed Line Items shall be referred to Ernst
and Young LLP (the "Accounting Firm") or such other independent accounting firm
on which Parent and Representative mutually agree, which agreement shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Parent and the Representative will enter into
reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the
Accounting Firm under this Section 2.10(b)(ii)(B), such services to be
provided in the Accounting Firm's capacity as an accounting expert and

|

| 

not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall be directed to determine as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days from the
date that the dispute is submitted to it), whether the Merger Consideration as
set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. The Accounting Firm
shall be instructed that, in making such determination, it may not assign a
value to any Disputed Line Items that is greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item or less than the smallest value claims for such item by
Parent or the Representative, and that the Accounting Firm is only to consider
matters still in dispute between Parent and the Representative. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Representative shall each furnish to the
Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the remaining Disputed Line Items, and shall provide interviews and answer
questions, as such Accounting Firm may reasonably request. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Representative, and the representatives and
Affiliates of each, shall not have any ex parte communications with the
Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties.

(C) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Parent, on
the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand, so that the amount of
fees and expenses paid by the party which delivered the Notice of Disagreement
(with the remainder being paid by the other party) shall be equal to the
product of (i) and (ii), where (i) is the aggregate amount of the fees and
expenses and (ii) is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in
dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by the party delivering the
Notice of Disagreement (as determined by the Accounting Firm), and the
denominator of which is the total absolute value in dispute as finally brought
forth to the Accounting Firm.

(D) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
final determination of the Final Merger Consideration (as defined below),
Parent shall afford, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to afford, to the Representative and any accountants, counsel or
financial advisers retained by the Representative in connection with the
review of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and
Seller Expenses in accordance with this Section 2.10, reasonable access during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to the books, contracts,
personnel, representatives (including Parent's accountants) and records of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and its representatives (including
the work papers of Parent's accountants) to the extent relevant to the review
of the Closing Statement and Parent's determination of Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Seller Expenses in accordance with
this Section 2.10. If Representative claims that Parent has failed to comply
with its obligation under this Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D) to provide access to
books, contracts, personnel, representatives (including Parent's accountants)
and records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and its
representatives, it may initiate the appointment of the Accounting Firm as
described above and the Accounting Firm shall have the authority to determine
if Parent has complied with its obligations to provide access and to order
Parent to comply with any such obligations contained in Section
2.10(b)(ii)(D).

(E) After the Merger Consideration has been finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.10(b)(ii) (the Merger Consideration as so determined being
referred to herein as the "Final Merger Consideration"), the following
payments shall be made:

(1) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration and the Parent Excess Amount is greater than $1,000,000, then,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration, (i) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount in cash equal to
the portion of the Parent Excess Amount that is payable to the Sellers that
held Common Stock or a beneficial interest in the Company Warrant to the
Paying Agent (for distribution to such Sellers in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares) and the remainder of the Parent Excess Amount to
the Surviving Corporation (for distribution through payroll to the holders of
Vested Company Options in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares)
and (ii) the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow
Agent in part to the Paying Agent to be paid to the Sellers that held shares
of Common Stock or a beneficial interest in the Company Warrant in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares and in part to the Surviving Corporation
(for distribution through payroll to the holders of Vested Company Options in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares).

(2) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration and the Representative Excess Amount is greater than $3,500,000,
then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Merger Consideration, (i) an amount equal to the portion of the Representative
Excess Amount that exceeds $3,500,000 shall be released by the Escrow Agent
out of the Working Capital Escrow Account to Parent and (ii) the remainder of
the Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any, shall be released by the Escrow
Agent in part to the Paying Agent to be paid to the Sellers that held shares
of Common Stock or a beneficial interest in the Company Warrant in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares and in part to the Surviving Corporation
(for distribution through payroll to the holders of Vested Company Options in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) (it being understood that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery for any payment required to
be made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b)(ii)(E)(2)).

(F) If, after the determination of the Final Merger Consideration, the Parent
Excess Amount is not greater than $1,000,000 and the Representative Excess
Amount is not greater than $3,500,000, then, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Merger Consideration, the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent in part to the Paying
Agent to be paid to the Sellers that held shares of Common Stock or a
beneficial interest in the Company Warrant in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares and in part to the Surviving Corporation (for distribution
through payroll to the holders of Vested Company Options in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares).

(G) Promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days, after receipt
of the amounts to be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section
2.10(b)(ii)(E), if any, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of
Vested Company Options the applicable portion of such amount (based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares) through the Surviving Corporation's payroll.

(H) Payments pursuant to this Section 2.10(b)(ii) shall be treated for all
purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(c) Accounting Procedures. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group Companies in
accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Group Companies in the
preparation of the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014,
except that such statements, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not
include any purchase accounting or other adjustments arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall be
based on facts and circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing and shall
exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the

Statement and the Closing Statement shall be calculated consistently with the

items not included in Exhibit B.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Stockholder who (i) has not voted in
favor of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and (ii) who shall
have otherwise perfected such holder's dissenters' rights in accordance with
and as contemplated by the applicable provisions of the DGCL (each such
Stockholder, a "Dissenting Stockholder", and each share of Common Stock held
by such Dissenting Stockholder, a "Dissenting Share") shall not be converted

such Common Stock under Section 2.8, but shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by the applicable provisions of the DGCL; provided, however,
that if such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws

shares under the applicable provisions of the DGCL, each share of Common Stock

| 

and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the amounts payable with respect to such Common Stock under Section
2.8, and such share of Common Stock shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. In
such event, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver the amounts payable with

entitled (without interest) as and when such payments are required to be made
following surrender by such Stockholder of the certificate or certificates
representing the shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder and the
Letter of Transmittal in the manner provided in Section 3.2.

Transmittal properly completed and duly executed and shall include appropriate
transmittal materials and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of

converted. Parent expressly waives any requirement for a bond or other
security in connection therewith. No Stockholder shall be entitled to any
portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8 or any Other
Seller Payment until such holder delivers a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and surrenders such holder's Stock Certificate or Stock
Certificates or delivers a Lost Certificate Affidavit as provided in this

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
shall pay to the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes payable by
the Surviving Corporation required by reason of the payment of such
consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Stock
Certificate so surrendered, or such Person shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

Section 3.4 No Liability for Abandoned Property. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
Representative or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Seller for any

Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation (and any such cash may be commingled
with the general funds of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto (other than the claims of a Seller and its heirs, assigns and
transferees hereunder) and shall be promptly delivered to the Surviving
Corporation by the Paying Agent, and such Stockholder or Beneficial
Warrantholder shall look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of such
amounts. Each Stockholder or Beneficial Warrantholder who prior to such date

the Paying Agent for satisfaction of any claims related to the Merger
Consideration and such other amounts (except to the extent the Paying Agent
has returned such funds to the Surviving Corporation as contemplated above, in
which case such Seller shall only look to the Surviving Corporation as
contemplated above). Any interest, dividends or other income earned on the
investment of cash held by the Paying Agent, together with all tax and other
liabilities associated therewith, shall be for the account of the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation will be liable to any Seller for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts payable to the Sellers hereunder if delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

Section 3.6 Rights of Former Stockholders. At the Effective Time, the stock,
warrant and option transfer books of Company shall be closed as to
Stockholders, Optionholders and Beneficial Warrant Holders immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and no transfer of Common Stock, Company Options or the
Company Warrant

by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. From and after the
Effective Time, each Stock Certificate theretofore representing shares of
Common Stock, the Company Options and the Company Warrant shall from and after
the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration as described herein and such Other Seller
Payments as described herein. The Merger Consideration and such additional
amounts (if any) payable in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Common Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares), the Company Options and
the Company Warrant.

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant, on a joint and several

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement

hereby. No vote of Parent's equityholders is required to approve this
Agreement or for Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been (and the Ancillary
Documents to which Parent and Merger Sub are parties will be) duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a
valid, legal and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub (assuming
this Agreement has been and the Ancillary Documents to which Parent and Merger
Sub are parties will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
parties thereto), enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be

other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b)
that the availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance,
is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof
may be brought.

Section 5.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Assuming the truth and

4.5, no material notices to, filings with, or authorization, consent or
approval of any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the Ancillary
Documents to which Parent or Merger Sub are a party or the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i)
compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and any required competition
filing with any foreign Governmental Entity, (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, (iii) those set forth on Schedule 5.3 and (iv) those
the failure of which to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the
execution, delivery and performance by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents to which Parent or Merger Sub are a party nor the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of Parent's or
Merger Sub's Governing Documents, (b) except as set forth on Schedule 5.3,
result in a material violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material Contract or obligation to which
Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, or (c) violate in any material
respect any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation
of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except
in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for violations which would not
prevent or materially delay the Merger.

Section 5.4 Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent and Merger Sub, threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or any material
portion of their respective properties or assets that would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair or delay the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any unsatisfied order,
writ, injunction or decree that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.5 Brokers. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment banker
is entitled to any brokerage, finder's, financial advisor's or investment
banker's fee or commission or similar payment in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
for which Sellers or any Group Company may become liable.

Section 5.6 Financing. Attached hereto as Exhibit F are true, complete and
correct copies of an executed commitment letter and corresponding customarily
redacted fee letter (none of which redacted terms would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing or affect
the conditions thereto) from the financial institutions identified therein
(the "Debt Financing Commitments," as each may be amended or replaced from
time to time to the extent permitted by Section 6.8(a)) to provide, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing"). Each of
the Debt Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, each of the Debt
Financing Commitments is in full force and effect, and none of the Debt
Financing Commitments has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated. As of the date hereof, Parent is not in breach of any


 

--- 
| | 

|

41

| 

of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Debt Financing Commitments,
and as of the date hereof no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach,
default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of
the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in
the Debt Financing Commitments will fail to be satisfied, which failure would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing, or that the Debt Financing will not be made available on a timely
basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
As of the date hereof, no counterparty to any Debt Financing Commitment has
notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of the Debt Financing
Commitments or not to provide the Debt Financing. Assuming the funding in full
of the Debt Financing, the net proceeds from the Debt Financing will be
sufficient, together with any available cash-on-hand of Parent, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of any
fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, or the Company, and any related
repayment or refinancing of any Indebtedness of the Company, and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has paid in full any and
all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments that
are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such
fees as they become due. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to
the obligations of the parties under the Debt Financing Commitments (including
pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) to
make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent on the terms
therein except as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments or as
would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the
Debt Financing. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its respective Affiliates is a party
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Debt Financing that could adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments.
No person has any right to impose, and none of the Financing Sources or Parent
has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such funding other
than any of the conditions expressly set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Debt
Financing Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which
would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Financing Commitments on the Closing Date). Subject to the Company's
compliance with this Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth herein, and the satisfaction (or waiver)
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, or that
the Debt Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for
Parent to obtain the Debt Financing or any alternative financing.

Section 5.7 Merger Sub Activities. Merger Sub was organized solely for the
purpose of entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby and has not engaged in any activities or business, and has
incurred no liabilities or obligations whatsoever, in each case, other than
those incident to its organization and the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.8 Solvency. Assuming the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement are true in all material respects, at and
immediately after the Effective Time, and after giving effect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Group Companies will (a) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair
value of its assets or because the fair salable value of its assets is less
than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts
as they mature), (b) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in
its business or (c) have incurred debts (and does not immediately plan to
incur debt) beyond its ability to pay as they become due.

Section 5.9 Acknowledgment and Representations by Parent and Merger Sub. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis
of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Group Companies.
In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied
solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly contained in Article 4, and each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that, other than as set forth in this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered pursuant hereto, none of the Sellers, the Group Companies or any of
their respective directors,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, during the period
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Group Companies shall be
permitted to utilize any and all available Cash and Cash Equivalents (i) to
pay Seller Expenses and (ii) to repay outstanding Indebtedness and any amounts
owing under the Management Services Agreement, in each case, at such times and
in such amounts as the Company or the applicable Subsidiary shall deem
necessary, appropriate, or desirable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, prior to Closing neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
will manage or attempt to manage the conduct of business in the ordinary
course by Company or any of the other Group Companies.

Section 6.2 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. All transfer taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes
that are imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes") shall be borne by Parent. The Party required by law to file a Tax
Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely prepare, with the
other Party's cooperation, and file such Tax Return. Parent and the Sellers
agree to timely sign and deliver (or to cause to be timely signed and
delivered) such certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate and
otherwise to cooperate to establish any available exemption from (or otherwise
reduce) such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Tax Certificates. At or prior to the Closing (i) the Company shall deliver
to Parent an affidavit certifying that interests in the Company are not
"United States real property interests" (within the meaning of Section 897 of
the Code), which affidavit shall be dated as of the Closing Date, signed under
penalties of perjury and in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c) and 1.897-2(h), together with a notice to the
IRS in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
1.897-2(h) and (ii) each Seller that is a United States person and that is
identified on Annex I hereto shall deliver to Parent a certificate, signed
under penalty of perjury and in form and substance as required under the
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b), stating that such Seller is not a
"foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Code (a "Non-Foreign
Certificate"). The Representative and the Company shall cause to be included
in the Letter of Transmittal delivered to each Stockholder pursuant to Section
3.2 a form of Non-Foreign Certificate and a request that each such Stockholder
that is not a foreign person as defined in Section 1445 properly complete,
duly execute and timely provide to Parent a Non-Foreign Certificate.

(c) Filing of Tax Returns. The Company (i) shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed (taking into account any extension) by a Group Company on or before the
Closing Date and that have not been filed as of the date hereof, (ii) shall
use reasonable best efforts to prepare all United States federal, state and
local Tax Returns of any Group Company for the taxable year 2014 in a manner
and on a timeframe that would be expected to allow the timely filing of such
Tax Returns and (iii) shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Group
Companies due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Group Companies
except as required by applicable Law or as agreed to by Parent. At least ten
(10) days prior to the filing by a Group Company of any U.S. federal or state
income or other material Tax Return pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, the Company shall use submit (or cause to be submitted) a draft of
such Tax Return to Parent for Parent's review and comment. The Representative
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments that Parent submits to
the Representative in writing at least five (5) days prior to the filing date
of such Tax Return.

Section 6.3 Access to Information; Inspection.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions contained in the
confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are subject, the
Company shall provide, and shall cause the Group Companies to provide, to
Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized representatives, advisors and
agents during normal business hours reasonable access to the Real Property,
facilities, books and records, personnel, contracts and all other documents,
data and information concerning the business and operations of the Group
Companies as Parent may reasonably request, including access to conduct Phase
I (but not Phase II without the prior written consent of the Company)
environmental assessments (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal
business operations of any Group Company); provided that such access shall not
include the right to conduct any invasive sampling, testing or


 

--- 
| | 

|

46

| 

analysis of any environmental media or building materials, including soil,
groundwater, surface water, sediment, air or wastewater, in each case, without
the prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Group Companies shall be required to
provide such access or disclose any information to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective authorized representatives, if doing so would (i) result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar
privilege or (ii) violate any contract or law, rule or regulation to which any
Group Company is a party or to which any Group Company is subject, in each
case, so long as the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of any Person necessary to permit such
disclosure or to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements.

(b) Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, at Parent's sole
cost, to cause an ALTA Survey of the Owned Real Property to be performed by
one or more licensed surveyors as soon as possible. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the receipt of any ALTA Surveys nor Parent's satisfaction with
any of the foregoing that are received shall be a condition to Closing.

(c) Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, at Parent's sole
cost, to attempt to cause a national title company designated by Parent (a
"Title Company") to deliver as of the Closing, (1) (A) an ALTA Form B (revised
2006) extended coverage owner's title insurance policy issued by a Title
Company, dated the Closing Date, showing no exceptions to title other than
Permitted Liens, in the face amount designated by Parent and showing one of
the Group Companies to be the holder of the fee interest in such Owned Real
Property, together with such endorsements as Parent shall require, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Parent in its sole discretion, or (B) such
endorsements to the Existing Owned Property Title Policies as Parent shall
require, including an endorsement bringing such Existing Owned Property Title
Policies forward to the date of the Closing and showing no exceptions to title
other than Permitted Liens, an endorsement increasing the amount of coverage
under such title policy to such amount as Parent shall reasonably require, and
a non-imputation endorsement, and (2) with respect to any Leased Real
Property, an ALTA Form B (revised 2006) extended coverage leasehold title
insurance policy issued by a Title Company, dated the Closing Date, showing no
exceptions to title other than Permitted Liens, in the face amount designated
by Parent and showing one of the Group Companies to be the holder of the
leasehold interest in such Leased Real Property, together with such
endorsements as Parent shall require, all in form and substance satisfactory
to Parent in its sole discretion (the documents described in (1) and (2)
collectively, the "Updated Title Policies"). The Group Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Title Companies such
statements, releases, undertakings, affidavits, instruments and indemnities as
the Title Companies shall reasonably require to issue the Updated Title
Policies provided that such documents can be delivered without material cost
or contingent liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries except that the
Group Companies shall deliver to the Title Company executed Owner's Affidavits
(the "Owner's Affidavits") with respect to the Owned Real Property. Copies of
the Owner's Affidavits to be executed are attached hereto as Exhibit G. For
the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of any Updated Title Policies shall not be
a condition to Closing.

(d) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall request,
and use its reasonable good faith efforts to obtain (i) a Landlord Estoppel,
from each of the Landlords under each Material Real Property Lease, (ii) an
Owned Real Property Tenant Estoppel from any Owned Real Property Tenants
designated by the Parent, (iii) the Development Estoppel from the City of
Clifton, and (iv) the REA Estoppel from 2 Peekay Associates, LLC, a New Jersey
limited liability company (or its successor), provided, that, except as set
forth in Section 7.2(d), neither the receipt of any Landlord Estoppels, Owned
Real Property Tenant Estoppel, Development Estoppel or REA Estoppel nor
Parent's satisfaction with any of the foregoing that are received shall be a
condition to Closing.

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Consent in accordance with the requirements of the applicable Real Property
Leases. In addition, the Company shall provide written notice to each Person
entitled to notice of the Merger under any Contract described in the
Schedules, including the Landlords (other than any Landlord that is a
subsidiary of Parent) entitled to notice of the deemed assignment contemplated
by the Merger (provided that any such notice described in this Section 6.3(e)
may be provided on the Closing Date unless required to be provided on an
earlier date pursuant to the terms of the applicable Contract, and, in all
such instances, the Company shall provide the notice no later than the date
required by the applicable Contract). In the event a Person is entitled to
consent to the Merger under any Contract described in the Schedules, notice
and a request for consent shall be made by the Company promptly following the
entry into this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Confidentiality Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and,
in addition, covenant and agree to keep confidential, in accordance with the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of this Section 6.4 shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.

Section 6.5 Efforts to Consummate.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Article
7). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to (i) secure any consents, waivers and approvals of any third party
(other than a Governmental Entity) required to be obtained to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that, except
as provided in the Side Letter, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, such action shall not include any requirement of any party
hereto or any of such parties' Affiliates to pay money to any such third
party, commence or participate in any litigation, offer or grant any
accommodation or undertake any obligation or liability (in each case financial
or otherwise) to any such third party (subject to the parties obligations in
Section 6.5(d)), and (ii) obtain consents of all Governmental Entities
necessary to, in each case, consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall make an appropriate filing, if required,
pursuant to the HSR Act and with any applicable foreign Governmental Entity
for which a competition filing is required, in each case, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly after the date of this
Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or applicable law governing a foreign
competition filing. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent and its
Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the
HSR Act or applicable law governing a foreign competition filing or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other
Parties hereto, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all actions that
are required by any Governmental Entity to expeditiously consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) selling, licensing
or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell, license
or otherwise dispose of, any entities, assets or facilities of any Group
Company after the Closing or any entity, facility or asset of Parent or its
Affiliates, (B) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result
in a breach of a contractual obligation to a third party) of any Group Company
after the Closing or Parent or any of its Affiliates, and (C) amending,
assigning or terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than
terminations that would result in a breach of a license or such other
agreement with a third party) and entering into such new licenses or other
agreements, in each case of any Group Company after the Closing or Parent or
any of its Affiliates. All HSR Act and applicable foreign competition filing
fees shall be borne by Parent.

(b) Further, each of the Parties shall cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry and shall promptly (i) furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Parties may
request in connection with the foregoing, (ii) inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) provide counsel for the other Parties with
copies of all filings made by such Party, and all correspondence between such
Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other
information supplied by such Party and such Party's Affiliates to a
Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that materials
may be redacted as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and with
applicable law. Each Party shall, subject to applicable law, permit counsel
for the other Parties to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties agree not to participate, or to permit their
Affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Parties in
advance and gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Parent
shall have

| | 

|

48

| 

ultimate decision-making authority with regard to any discussions,
submissions, negotiations and other communications with all Governmental
Entities in connection with any Action involving antitrust or competition
issues in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To
the extent practicable Parent shall provide the Company with the opportunity
to provide its point of view on such matters and shall consider that point of
view in good faith in exercising its decision-making authority under this
provision.

(c) Further, and without limiting the generality of the rest of this Section
6.5, in the event that a Governmental Entity issues a request for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (the "Second
Request") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall make (or cause to be
made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other, an appropriate response in compliance with the Second Request in order
to obtain expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period before
the Termination Date.

(d) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the Parties hereto agree to cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is
issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best
efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.6 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill the rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the directors,
officers, employees or agents of any Group Company (collectively, the
"Indemnitees"), as provided in such Group Company's Governing Documents or
under any indemnification or similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof
and set forth in Schedule 6.6 (the "Indemnification Agreements") with respect
to any matters arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their
capacity as directors, officers, employees or agents of any Group Company
occurring prior to the Closing Date. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, such indemnification shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses in connection
with such indemnification as provided in such Group Company's Governing
Documents or the Indemnification Agreements. For a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the indemnification and liability limitation or
exculpation provisions of the Group Companies' Governing Documents shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of Indemnitees for
periods prior to the Closing Date, unless such modification is required by
applicable Law. The Indemnification Agreements with Indemnitees that survive
the Merger shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. The Company shall not enter into any new any indemnification or similar
agreement, or amend in any way the existing Indemnification Agreements, after
the date hereof.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that certain Indemnitees
may have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by Persons (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the "Indemnitors"). Parent hereby agrees (i) that the
applicable Group Company is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to the Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the
applicable Group Company shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement of an
Indemnitee to the extent legally permitted and required by the terms of this
Agreement or the Governing Documents of any Group Company (or any
Indemnification Agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any such Indemnitee) without regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have
against the Indemnitors upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified and (iii) the Group Companies
irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitors from any and all
claims against the Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Parent and the Indemnitees agree that
the Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this
Section 6.6(b).

(c) The Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries will maintain in effect
beginning on the Closing and for a period of six years thereafter without any
lapses in coverage, in each case at Parent's expense, a directors' and
officers' "tail" or "runoff" insurance program purchased by the Company prior
to the Effective Date that is either available to be purchased under the
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance plan of the Company or
that otherwise has an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in
an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage limit under the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability policy, in each case,
covering the Company's and its Subsidiaries' directors and officers for
wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed prior to the
Effective Time for an aggregate cost not to exceed 300% of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance plan.

(d) The Indemnitiees entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this Section 6.6 are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6. This Section 6.6 shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

Section 6.7 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, consultants, advisors, attorneys, accountants or
agents (collectively, the "Group Company Representatives") of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and/or their respective Affiliates) concerning any merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any of the
Group Companies' capital stock or equity securities or assets, other than the
exercise of outstanding Company Options and other than assets sold in the
ordinary course of business (each such transaction, an "Acquisition
Transaction"). The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and the Group Company Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions and negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and/or their respective Affiliates)
conducted with respect to any Acquisition Transaction and not terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company or any other Group Company is party.

Section 6.8 Financing.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on a timely basis on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments, including
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the
applicable Debt Financing Commitments and any definitive agreements related
thereto (the "Debt Financing Documents"), (ii) maintain in effect the
applicable Debt Financing Documents, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the applicable Debt Financing Documents on a timely
basis on terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions)
contained therein or otherwise not materially less favorable to Parent in the
aggregate than those contained in the applicable Debt Financing Documents,
(iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent contained
in the applicable Debt Financing Documents within their control, including the
payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Debt Financing and (v) consummate the applicable Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that it is not
a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing). Parent shall keep the
Representative and the Company informed on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.
Parent shall give the Representative and the Company prompt notice upon having
knowledge of any breach by any party of any of the Debt Financing Documents or
any termination of any of the Debt Financing Documents, in each case that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing. Other than as set forth in Section 6.8(b), Parent shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company amend, modify, supplement or
waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Documents, in each case to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A)
adversely affecting in any material respect the ability of Parent to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) amending,
modifying,

supplementing or waiving the conditions or contingencies to the Debt Financing
in a manner materially adverse to the Company or the Sellers or (C) materially
delaying the Closing.

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to promptly obtain the
Debt Financing or such unavailable portion of the Debt Financing from
alternative sources, which may include one or more of a senior secured debt
financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and
sale of other debt securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is available,
to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Alternative Debt Financing")
and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the "Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that
provides for financing (A) on terms not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent, (B) containing conditions to draw and other terms that
would reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are
not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained
in the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof and (2) would not
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and (C) in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is available,
to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such event, the term "Debt
Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Debt Financing and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" as used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Commitment
Letter.

(c) The Company acknowledges that Parent intends to pursue the Anticipated
Financing, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries and each of the Group Companies' directors, officers,
employees, consultants, advisors, accountants, agents and representatives to,
use its reasonable best efforts to provide such assistance as is reasonably
requested by Parent and that is customary in connection with Parent's efforts
to arrange the Anticipated Financing (provided, however, that such requested
assistance does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company), including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) participate in and
assist with activities undertaken (or proposed to be undertaken) in connection
with the syndication, placement, offering or other marketing of the Financing
(including using reasonable best efforts to cause (A) the participation by
senior management in meetings, diligence or drafting sessions, rating agency
presentations, road shows or meetings with prospective lenders and investors
with respect to the Financing and (B) the delivery of customary authorization
letters, confirmations, and undertakings in connection with the Marketing
Material (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-
public information and accuracy of the information contained therein)); (ii)
timely furnish Parent and the Financing Sources with the Financing Information
and the Financing Deliverables; (iii) assist Parent and/or the Financing
Sources in the preparation of (A) customary bank books, information or
offering memoranda, prospectuses and other information packages and roadshow
materials with respect to the Financing; and (B) marketing materials
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, for rating agency
presentations or as otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing
Sources in connection with the syndication or other marketing of the Financing
(collectively the materials described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
the "Marketing Material"); (iv) (A) obtain customary accountant's comfort
letters and consents from the Company's independent auditors and participation
by the Company's independent auditors in due diligence sessions conducted in
connection with the provision or such comfort letters and consents and (B)
cause its independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing, (v) provide
monthly financial statements (within 30 days following the applicable month
end) relating to the Company for each month subsequent to the most recent
fiscal quarter in respect of which financial statements have been delivered
pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition of "Financing Information" to the
extent historically prepared by the Company in the ordinary course of
business, and (vi) provide such other information and take such other actions
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by
Parent or its Financing Sources in connection with any Financing; provided,
that none of the Sellers, the Company or any of the Group Companies shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing; and provided, further, that
the effectiveness of any documentation executed by any Group Company with
respect thereto shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing. Any
information provided to Parent or any other Person pursuant to this Section
6.8(c) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Parent acknowledges
and agrees that none of the Sellers nor any Group Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) shall have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any person under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Alternative
Financing, Debt

Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing that Parent may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Representative, the Sellers, the
Group Companies and their respective Affiliates and directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and
accounting advisors) from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Alternative Financing, Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Group Companies
expressly for use in connection therewith), and each of such Persons is
intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section 6.8(c). Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly, upon the request of the Company,
reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the
Group Companies in connection with cooperation taken by them at the request of
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.8(c).

Section 6.9 Documents and Information. After the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of
the Group Companies in existence on the Closing Date and, except as is
necessary to ensure compliance with applicable Law, preserve any applicable
privilege or compliance with contractual confidentiality obligations, make the
same available for inspection and copying by the Representative (at
Representative's expense) during normal business hours of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice; provided, that any such access or copying shall be
had or done in such a manner not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
conduct of Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's business. No such books,
records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary of
the Closing Date by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, without first advising the Representative in writing and giving
the Representative a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof. Any
information obtained by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be held
in confidence by such Sellers.

Section 6.10 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates
to) contact any customer, supplier, distributor or other material business
relation of any Group Company regarding any Group Company, its business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, that it is hereby understood and agreed that the foregoing
restriction shall in no way be construed to restrict the current business
operations and activities of Parent or its Affiliates. The Company may
designate any employee or group of employees as authorized contact persons
through whom Parent and its Affiliates shall direct all communications prior
to Closing.

Section 6.11 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31
of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall provide
each employee of each Group Company who continues to be employed by a Group
Company with the same salary or hourly wage rate and cash bonus incentive
target, in the aggregate, as provided to such employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date and with employee benefits (excluding equity arrangements)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits
maintained by the Group Companies as of the date of this Agreement. Parent
further agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, from and after
the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to grant all of its employees credit for any
service with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for
eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations under any broad-based benefit or compensation
plan, program or arrangement (but excluding individual agreements) that may be
established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date for such Group Company employees or,
as applicable, to the same extent that service credit is provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates under the corresponding plan, program or arrangement in which such
similarly situated employees participate (the "New Plans"), to the extent that
such service was credited under the corresponding Group Company plan or
program. From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor the employment,
severance or similar agreements between the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any officer, director or employee of the Company

| 

or its Subsidiaries which the Company has made available to Parent prior to
the date hereof, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing, and the parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the Closing,
such agreements shall be assumed by operation of Law. In addition, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively at work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the
extent waived or satisfied by an employee under a corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance
and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before the Closing Date in the
year in which the Closing occurs by any employee (or covered dependent
thereof) of any Group Company to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket
provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year in
which the Closing occurs. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall,
or shall be construed so as to, to confer upon any employee of any Group
Company any right to continued employment for any period or continued receipt
of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any
other modification of any New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan. Parent agrees
that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be solely responsible for
satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

(b) Parent agrees that it will, and will cause its Affiliates to, maintain and
not terminate or amend the 2015 Retention Plan prior to the expiration of its
term.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall or shall be construed so as
to (i) subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreement, prevent or
restrict in any way the right of the Buyer to terminate reassign, promote or
demote any employee, independent contractor, director or other service
provider of the Group Company (or to cause any of the foregoing actions) at
any time following the Closing, or to change (or cause the change of) the
title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other
compensation or terms or conditions of employment or service of any such
service providers at any time following the Closing; (ii) create any third
party rights in any such current or former service provider of the Group
Company (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof); or (iii) subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this Section 6.11 obligate Parent or
any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or
other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or prevent Parent or
any of its Affiliates from modifying or terminating any such plan, program or
other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time.

Section 6.12 Notice of Certain Matters. During the period from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each Party shall give prompt
written notice to the other Parties of (i) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure would or would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, which, in each case, would reasonably be expected to result in any
conditions set forth in Article 7 not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no notice under this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to have modified
any representation and/or warrant or cured any breach of a covenant for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article 7, a Party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 8
or a Party's right to indemnification hereunder.

Section 6.13 280G. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, with respect to
any payments and/or benefits that could, separately or in the aggregate,
without regard to the measures described herein, constitute "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the
applicable rulings and final regulations thereunder ("Section 280G Payments"),
(a) use reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent a Parachute
Payment Waiver from each Person who is a "disqualified individual" with
respect to any Group Company, and (b) as soon as practicable following the
delivery of the Parachute Payment Waivers (if any) to Parent, prepare and
distribute to its shareholders a disclosure statement describing all potential
parachute payments and benefits that may be received by such disqualified
individual(s) and submit such 280G Payments to a vote satisfying the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, such that no portion of the
Section 280G Payments will constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity

executed the Stockholder Written Consent a notice that complies with Section

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by written consent of
the Stockholders, which notice shall also constitute the notice required under
applicable Laws that appraisal or similar rights may be available to the
Stockholders who did not execute the Stockholder Written Consent, under
certain circumstances. Any materials to be submitted to the Stockholders by
the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be subject to Parent's advance review and comment.

such holder and the exercise price per share of such beneficial interest.

Section 6.16 Additional Transactions. Parent shall have the option, in its
sole discretion and without requiring the further consent of the Company, upon
reasonable notice to the Company, to request that the Company, immediately
prior to the Closing (and subject to the actual consummation of the Closing),
(a) convert or cause the conversion of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company
that are organized as corporations into limited liability companies (or other
entities) and one or more Subsidiaries of the Company that are organized as

none of the Requested Transactions shall) (x) delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger (or subject the completion of the Merger to any
uncertainty), (y) be in contravention of any laws or any Governing Documents
or any other contract or agreement to which the Group Companies or any of
their respective assets are bound, or (z) cause any Seller Group Indemnified
Person to suffer or incur any Loss that such Seller Group Indemnified Person
would not have otherwise suffered or incurred but for the taking of such
action and for which Parent has not indemnified such Seller Group Indemnified

the Effective Time (without jeopardizing the purpose of the Requested

that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger have been satisfied),
(iii) the consummation of any such Requested Transactions shall be contingent

satisfied (or, with respect to Section 7.2, at the option of Parent, waived),

Indemnified Person") from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, fees, Taxes, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties ("Losses") suffered or incurred by them in connection with or as a
result of any Requested Transactions, any action taken pursuant to this
Section 6.16 (or the evaluation or consideration of any such Requested
Transaction or requested action, whether or not such Requested Transaction
occurs or such requested action is taken). Without limiting the foregoing,
none of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or any of
its Affiliates shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by,
any of the Requested Transactions. The indemnification obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub in this Section 6.16 are for the express benefit of and may be
enforced by each Seller Group Indemnified Person, whether or not such Person
is a party to this Agreement.

| 

such representations or warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures
to perform any covenant or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within
twenty (20) days after written notice thereof is delivered to Representative;
provided that Parent and Merger Sub are not then in breach of this Agreement
so as to cause the condition to Closing set forth in either Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) from being satisfied;

(c) by the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in Article 5 shall not be true and correct or if either

by written notice to Parent, extend the Termination Date until the 60th day
after January 11, 2016, in which case the term "Termination Date" shall for
all purposes hereof be deemed to refer to such 60th day; (iii) that if the

set forth in Section 7.3 (not including conditions which are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or that the Company is
willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.3 for the purpose of
consummating the Closing, and (iii) the Merger shall not have been consummated
on the later of the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.2 and the expiration of three (3) business days following the
Company's delivery of such notice; and

(g) by either Parent or by the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; provided that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) shall have used reasonable best
efforts to remove such order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction;
provided, further, that no Party shall be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if the imposition of such order,
decree or ruling was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Damage. In the event of any Material Damage to the Owned Real
Property located in Atlanta, Georgia or any portion thereof, Parent may, at
its option, by notice to the Company given within ten (10) Business Days after
the Company notifies Parent in writing of such Material Damage: (a) terminate
this Agreement,

|

57

| 

in which event the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder except
as set forth in Section 8.3, or (b) proceed to the Closing. "Material Damage"
means damage of at least fifty percent (50%) of the improvements which makes
it reasonably likely that the majority of the remaining improvements shall be
rendered unusable for the conduct of business for more than ninety (90) days
as conducted prior to the occurrence of the damage. If necessary, the Closing
Date shall be extended to give Parent the full 10-day period to make the
election above with respect to any Material Damage.

Section 8.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or Section 8.2, this entire Agreement shall
forthwith become void (and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers,
directors or equityholders) with the exception of (a) the provisions of this
Section 8.3, Article 9, Article 10 (other than Section 10.21) and the last
sentence of Section 6.4, each of which provisions shall survive such
termination and remain valid and binding obligations of the Parties, and (b)
any liability of any party hereto for any willful or intentional breach of or
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the failure by Parent to consummate the Closing (unless
such failure is primarily caused by the Company's failure to perform its
obligation to consummate the Closing) shall be deemed to be a willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement) prior to such termination in which case
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement the parties
shall be entitled to seek all remedies available at law or equity, including
equitable relief and damages. Nothing herein shall limit or prevent any party
hereto from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under Section 10.18.
No Seller Related Party shall have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, nothing in
this the last sentence of this Section 8.3 shall in any way limit or modify
the rights and obligations of Parent under this Agreement or any Financing
Source's obligations to Parent under any Debt Commitment Letter (the last
sentence of this Section 8.3 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the
Financing Sources).

Section 10.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; provided, however,
that without limitation of the provisions of Section 8.3 hereof, any and all
claims against any Financing Sources in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, shall be governed in accordance with the law of the State of New
York.

Section 10.5 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of
counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such fees or expenses.

Section 10.6 Construction; Interpretation. The term "this Agreement" means
this Agreement and Plan of Merger together with all Schedules and exhibits to
this Agreement ("Exhibits"), as the same may from time to time be amended,
modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No party hereto, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of
this Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair
meaning and not strictly for or against any party. When calculating the period
of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day. Any reference in this Agreement to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars.
Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use
thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and
Exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection paragraph,
subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (ii) masculine gender
shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; (iii)
words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice versa;
and (iv) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation". An item arising with respect to a
specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or
"set forth in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any such
phrase appears in such representation or warranty, if (A) there is a reserve,
accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or
financial statements that related to the subject matter of such representation
or warranty, (B) such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the balance
sheet or financial statements or (C) such item is reflected on the balance
sheet or financial statements and is specifically set forth in the notes
thereto.

Section 10.7 Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Schedules or other
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of
any dollar amount in the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not
intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement. No disclosure on a Section of the Schedules relating to a
possible breach or violation of any contract, law or order shall be construed
as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Any capitalized terms used in any Section of an Exhibit or the
Schedules but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in
this Agreement.

Section 10.8 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 6.6, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Sellers are third party
beneficiaries of Article 2, Article 9, Section 10.14 and Section 10.15 of this
Agreement and (ii) the Financing Sources are third party beneficiaries of the
last sentence of Section 8.3, this Section 10.8, Section 10.10, Section 10.14
and Section 10.21 of this Agreement.

Section 10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

Section 10.10 Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
law (including the DGCL) and Section 10.11, this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. After the Effective Time,
subject to applicable law (including the DGCL), this Agreement may be amended
or modified only by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the Surviving Corporation and the Representative. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except as provided in the immediately
preceding two sentences and any purported amendment by any party or parties
hereto effected in a manner which does not comply with this Section 10.10
shall be void. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Section 8.3, Section 10.8, this Section 10.10, Section 10.14 and Section 10.21
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse
in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources.

Section 10.11 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the Company
(on behalf of itself and Sellers) may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub contained
herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
Parent or Merger Sub contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto or (c) waive
compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
Company or Sellers contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company and Sellers contained herein or
in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or Sellers
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company and Sellers with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any Party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

Section 10.12 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same

| 

agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.13 Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder are jointly and severally guaranteed by each other.

Section 10.14 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that this
Agreement may only be enforced against the Persons that are expressly
identified as parties hereto, and may not be enforced by or against any
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
Person, management company, incorporator, member, partner, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, attorney or representative, financial
advisor or lender (all above-described Persons, collectively, "Affiliated
Persons") of any party hereto, or any Financing Source or any Affiliated
Persons of any of the foregoing (together with the Affiliated Persons of any
party hereto, the "Non-Recourse Parties"), whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred
by any Non-Recourse Party, as such, for any obligation under this Agreement or
any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or
for any Claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or
their creation; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) nothing in
this Section 10.14 shall in any way limit or modify any Financing Source's
obligations to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates under the Debt
Financing Commitments and (b) this Section 10.14 shall in no way be deemed to
limit the liability or obligations of any party to the extent that such party
is required to cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or their respective
Affiliated Persons to take any action or refrain from taking any action
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.15 Release. Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates and
each of its current and former officers, directors, employees, partners,
members, advisors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasing
Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever
discharges the Stockholders, the Optionholders, the Beneficial Warrant
Holders, their respective Affiliates and each of their respective current and
former officers, directors, employees, partners, members, advisors, successors
and assigns (collectively, the "Released Parties") of and from any and all
actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties,
debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and covenants (whether express or
implied), and claims and demands whatsoever, whether in law or in equity,
which the Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released Parties, now
or in the future, in each case, in respect of any cause, matter or thing
relating to any of the Released Parties occurring or arising on or prior to
the date of this Agreement (the "Released Claims"); provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Released Claims shall not include any
actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties,
debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and covenants (whether express or
implied), and claims and demands: (a) expressly permitted pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, (b) to enforce any covenants or
agreements of the Representative or any Seller in this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements, in each case, to the extent such covenant or agreement
expressly contemplates performance after the Closing Date by its terms, (c)
with respect to the payment of any adjustment amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), (d) based on Fraud or (e) that, in the case
of employees of the Company, do not arise solely out of or in relation to such
Released Party's capacity as a Seller or an equity holder of the Company. For
the sake of clarification, none of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed a Released Party for purposes of this Section
10.15. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall in any way
limit or alter the rights a party hereto may have against any insurance
carrier or any other third party that is not a Non-Recourse Party. The parties
hereto agree that the Sellers shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 10.15.

Section 10.16 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH

|

64

| 

DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

Section 10.17 Jurisdiction and Venue. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.10(B),
EACH OF THE PARTIES SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE CHANCERY
COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR, IF THE CHANCERY COURT DECLINES TO ACCEPT
JURISDICTION OVER A PARTICULAR MATTER, ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN
DELAWARE) IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY OTHER COURT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY
OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT
THERETO. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT OR ANY OTHER
PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE SERVED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE ON SUCH
PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED
AT THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTY AND IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF
NOTICES IN SECTION 10.3. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 10.17, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT
THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
LAW. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

Section 10.18 Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any Seller, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.19 Press Releases and Announcements. None of the Parties hereto nor
any of their respective representatives shall issue any press releases or make
any public announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without the prior written consent
of Parent or the Company, prior to the Closing, or the Representative,
following the Closing, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such press release or public announcement may be made if required by
applicable Law or a securities exchange rule; provided that the Party required
to make such press release or public announcement shall, to the extent
possible, confer with the other parties concerning the timing and content of
such press release or public announcement before the same is made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Seller that is an investment fund
(including Affiliates of such Seller) may provide general information about
the subject matter of this Agreement in connection with their fundraising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities of the kind customarily
provided with respect to investments of this nature (including disclosures
with respect to investment multiples, returns on investment, rates of return

Section 10.20 Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
acted as legal counsel to certain Sellers and the Representative and its
Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and
Ellis LLP intends to act as legal counsel to certain Sellers and the
Representative and its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Group
Companies) after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP
representing certain Sellers and the Representative and/or its Affiliates
after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub, any
Group Company or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between the Sellers, the
Representative, its Affiliates or any Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP
in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Representative and its Affiliates (and
not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP
relating to its engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(i) the Representative and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to
the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Representative and its Affiliates
(and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii)
Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and
any of the Group Companies or otherwise.

Section 10.21 Additional Financing Provisions. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Seller Related Party agrees (a) that any action of any
kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
involving a Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought
exclusively in the courts described in Section 10.17 and each Seller Related
Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (b) not to bring or permit any of
its affiliates or representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing
any such action in any other court, (c) that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided
in Section 10.3 shall be effective service of process against it for any such
action brought in any such court, (d) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (e) that a
final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law, (f) that the laws described in Section 10.4 shall govern any such action
and (g) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in
any such action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to Section
10.16. This Section 10.21 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the
Financing Sources.

Section 10.22 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
