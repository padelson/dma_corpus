   AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  



  

  This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this  " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of the  27th day of May, 2007, by and among URS Corporation,
a  Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Elk Merger  Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary  of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), Bear
Merger Sub,  Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of 
Parent (" _Second Merger Sub_ "), and Washington  Group International, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the  " _Company_ "). 

  



  

   RECITALS 

  



  

  WHEREAS, Parent and the Company desire that Parent combine its  businesses
with the businesses operated by the Company through  (i) the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company,  with the Company as the surviving corporation
(the  " _First Merger_ "), as more fully provided in this  Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of  the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ") and  (ii) immediately following the First Merger, the merger of 
the Company with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger  Sub as the
surviving corporation (the " _Second  Merger_ "), as more fully provided in
this Agreement and  in accordance with the DGCL; 

  



  

  WHEREAS, the board of directors (the " _Board_ ")  of each of Parent,
Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the Company  has determined that the First
Merger and the Second Merger,  taken together, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set  forth in this Agreement, are advisable, fair to and in
the best  interests of their respective stockholders; 

  



  

  WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that  the First
Merger and the Second Merger shall be treated as a  single integrated
transaction (collectively, the  " _Transaction_ ") and shall qualify as a 
"reorganization" within the meaning of  Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement will be, and is,  adopted as
a plan of reorganization; and 

  



  

  WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the Company  desire to
make those representations, warranties, covenants and  agreements specified
in this Agreement in connection with this  Agreement and the Transaction. 

  



  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the 
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained  in this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and the  Company agree as
follows: 

  



  

   ARTICLE I 
   

  



  

   THE  TRANSACTION   

  



  

  1.1. _The First Merger._ Upon the  terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in  accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, Merger
Sub shall be  merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. As a 
result of the First Merger, the separate corporate existence of  Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company, subject to  _Section 1.7_, shall continue its
existence as a  wholly owned subsidiary of Parent under the laws of the State
of  Delaware. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation  surviving the
First Merger, is sometimes referred to in this  Agreement as the " _First
Surviving Corporation_ ". 

  



  

  1.2. _Closing; Effective Time._ A  closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall be
held at the  offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 633 West Fifth  Street, Suite
4000, Los Angeles, California 90071, or such  other place as the parties
hereto may agree, as soon as  practicable but no later than the second
business day following  the date upon which all conditions set forth in 
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by  their nature are to be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, but  subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) are  satisfied or waived, or at such other date
as Parent and the  Company may agree (such date being referred to as, the  "
_Closing Date_ "). As promptly as possible on the  Closing Date, the parties
hereto shall cause the First Merger to  be consummated by filing with the
Secretary of State of the  State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of 
State_ ") a certificate of merger (the  " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such
form as is  required by and executed in accordance with Section 251 of  the
DGCL. The First Merger shall become effective when the  Certificate of Merger
has been filed with the Delaware Secretary  of State or at such later 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and  specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective  Time_ "). 

  



  

  1.3. _Effects of the First  Merger._ From and after the Effective Time,
the  First Merger shall have the effects set forth in  Section 259 of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of  the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement, all the property,
rights,  privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub 
shall vest in the First Surviving Corporation, and all debts,  liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall  become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the First Surviving  Corporation. 

  



  

  1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation and  Bylaws._ At the Effective Time,
(a) the  Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and 
restated as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and, as so  amended and restated,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation  of the First Surviving Corporation
and (b) the Bylaws of  Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time  shall be the Bylaws of the First Surviving Corporation, in
each  case, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and  this
Agreement and as provided in such Certificate of  Incorporation or Bylaws and
until the Second Merger becomes  effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that at
the  Effective Time, the provisions contained in such Bylaws  specifying the
corporate name shall be amended to read as  follows: "The name of the
Corporation is Washington Group  International, Inc.". 

  



  

  1.5. _Directors and Officers of the First Surviving  Corporation._ From
and after the Effective Time,  the officers of the Company shall be the
officers of the First  Surviving Corporation and the directors of Merger Sub
shall be  the directors of the First Surviving Corporation, in each case, 
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified  in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws  of the Surviving
Corporation and until the Second Merger becomes  effective. On or prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall  deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory
to Parent of the  resignations of the directors of the Company, such
resignations  to be effective as of the Effective Time. 

  



  

  1.6. _Additional Actions._ If, at any  time after the Effective Time, the
First Surviving Corporation  shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments  or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or 
desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or  otherwise, in the
First Surviving Corporation its right, title  or interest in, to or under any
of the property, rights,  privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
or  (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement,  the Company
and its officers and directors shall be deemed to  have granted to the First
Surviving Corporation an irrevocable  power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such deeds,  assignments or assurances in law and to take all
acts necessary,  proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to
and  possession of such property, rights, privileges, powers and  franchises
in the First Surviving Corporation and otherwise to  carry out the provisions
of this Agreement, and the officers and  directors of the First Surviving
Corporation are authorized in  the name of the Company or otherwise to take
any and all such  action. 

  



  

  1.7. _The Second Merger._ Immediately  following the First Merger, Parent
shall cause the First  Surviving Corporation to merge into the Second Merger
Sub, the  separate corporate existence of the First Surviving Corporation 
shall cease and the Second Merger Sub shall continue as the  surviving
corporation. Second Merger Sub, in its capacity as the  corporation surviving
the Second Merger, is sometimes referred  to in this Agreement as the "
_Surviving  Corporation_ ". There shall be no conditions to the  completion
of the Second Merger other than the completion of the  First Merger. Parent
shall cause the Second Merger to be  consummated by filing with the Delaware
Secretary of State a  certificate of merger (the " _Second Certificate of 
Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and executed in  accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL. The Second Merger  shall become effective when the
Second Certificate of Merger has  been filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State which shall be  filed immediately after the Effective Time (the "
_Second  Effective Time_ "). From and after the Second Effective  Time, the
Second Merger shall have the effects set forth in  Section 259 of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of  the foregoing, at the Second Effective
Time, except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement, all the property,
rights,  privileges, powers and franchises of the First Surviving 
Corporation and Second Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving  Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the First  Surviving Corporation and
Second Merger Sub shall become the  debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. At  the Second Effective Time, (a) the Certificate
of  Incorporation of Second Merger Sub in effect immediately prior  to the
Second Effective Time shall be the Certificate of  Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and (b) the  Bylaws of Second Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the  Second Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving  Corporation, in each case, until 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and this  Agreement and as
provided in such Certificate of Incorporation  or Bylaws and in each case the
Certificate of Incorporation and  the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include the  provisions required by _Section 5.2(b)._ From and  after
the Second Effective Time, the officers and the directors  of the First
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers and the  directors of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, until  their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified in  accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of  the Surviving Corporation. If, at any time after
the Second  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be 
advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law  or any
other acts are necessary or desirable to (x) vest,  perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving  Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of  the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the  First Surviving Corporation or the Company or (y)
otherwise  carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the First Surviving 
Corporation and its officers and directors shall be deemed to  have granted
to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power  of attorney to execute and
deliver all such deeds, assignments  or assurances in law and to take all
acts necessary, proper or  desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of  such property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises in
the  Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions  of
this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the  Surviving Corporation
are authorized in the name of the First  Surviving Corporation or otherwise
to take any and all such  action. 

  



  

   ARTICLE II 
   

  



  

   CONVERSION  OF SECURITIES   

  



  

  2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At  the Effective Time, by virtue of the
First Merger and without  any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or  their respective stockholders: 

  



  

  (a) Subject to this _Article II_, each share of  common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company  (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the 
Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall, by  virtue of
this Agreement and without any action on the part of  the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall thereafter  represent the right to receive (i) 0.772
(the  " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of common stock,  par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent (" _Parent  Common Stock_ ") and (ii) an amount equal to
$43.80  in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash  Amount_ " and,
together with the consideration referred  to in subclause (i) of this
_Section 2.1(a)_, the  " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

  



  

  (b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of  Company
Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration  pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall no longer be  outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and  shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (each a  " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any such 
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have  any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to  receive (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any  dividends and other distributions in accordance
with  _Section 2.2(f)_, and (iii) any cash to be paid  in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock in  accordance with _Section 2.3._ 

  



  

  (c) If at any time during the period between the date of  this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the  outstanding shares of capital
stock of Parent or the Company  shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization,  stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares,  or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such  period, the Merger Consideration and any number or amount 
contained in this Agreement which is based on the price of  Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock or the number of  shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock, as the  case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such  reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination,  exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend
thereon. 

  



  

  (d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common  Stock that are
owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub  immediately prior to the Effective
Time or held in treasury of  the Company (in each case, other than any such
Company Common  Stock held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled 
Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the First Merger, and  without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be  cancelled and retired without any
conversion thereof and shall  cease to exist and no payment shall be made in
respect thereof. 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger  and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, each  issued and outstanding share
of common stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into  and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common  stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving  Corporation. 

  



  

  2.2. _Surrender and Payment._  

  



  

  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a  bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably  acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange  Agent_ ") and shall cause to be deposited with the  Exchange
Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of  Company Common Stock and
the Performance Units, certificates  representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock and an amount of  cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be issued and
paid  pursuant to _Sections 2.1_, _2.3_ and  _2.6(d)_ , payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates  (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or  non-certificated Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry  (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the  provisions of this
_Article II._ Following the  Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available
to the Exchange  Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars 
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant  to _Section
2.2(f)._ Any cash and certificates  representing Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange  Agent (including the amount of any dividends or
other  distributions payable with respect thereto and such cash in lieu  of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to  _Section 2.3_) shall be referred to
in this Agreement  as the " _Exchange Fund._ " The Exchange Agent  shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger  Consideration
contemplated to be issued pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as  contemplated by _Section 2.3_, the Exchange Fund shall  not
be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably  practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later  than the second business day
following the Effective Time,  Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to send
to each holder of  record of shares of Company Common Stock, whose Company
Common  Stock was converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 2.1_, (i) a letter of transmittal for  use in such exchange (which
shall specify that the delivery  shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only  upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
effective  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the 
Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may  reasonably agree,
for use in effecting delivery of shares of  Company Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent, and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of  Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)  or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Exchange of any Book-
Entry Shares shall be effected in  accordance with Parents customary
procedures with respect  to securities represented by book entry. 

  



  

  (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have  been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,  upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or  effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry  Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with a
properly completed  letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance  with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may 
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled  to receive in
exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of  Parent Common Stock (which shall
be in non-certificated  book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested)  representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of 
Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to  receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (after taking into  account all shares of Company
Common Stock then held by such  holder) and (ii) a check in the amount equal
to the cash  portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the 
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and this  _Article II_, including
cash payable in lieu of  fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and 
dividends and other distributions pursuant to  _Section 2.2(f)_ (less any
required Tax withholding).  No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger  Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any  unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of  Certificates. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall,  after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the  right to receive such Merger
Consideration. 

  



  

  (c) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other  than the Person
in whose name the applicable surrendered  Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of such  payment that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any  transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash 
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the  surrendered
Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction  of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not  payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be  registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in  whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, 
it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the  surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise  be in 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such  delivery of
the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange  Agent any transfer Taxes
required as a result of such  registration in the name of a Person other than
the registered  holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of  the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not  payable. For
purposes of this Agreement,  " _Person_ " means an individual, a corporation,
a  limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a  trust or any
other entity, group (as such term is used in  Section 13 of the Exchange Act)
or organization, including  a Governmental Authority, and any permitted
successors and  assigns of such Person. 

  



  

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further  registration of
Transfers of shares of Company Common Stock.  From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates  representing shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any  rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock  except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable  Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to  the Exchange Agent, the First
Surviving Corporation or Parent,  they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the consideration  provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth,  in this _Article II._ 

  



  

  (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed  by the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock eighteen  (18) months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to  Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged  his shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration  in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that  time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the  Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders shares.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent, Merger Sub, the  Company nor the First Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to  any holder of shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a  public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property laws.  Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by
holders of  shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
as  such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of  any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by  Applicable Law,
become property of Parent free and clear of any  claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to  shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the First Merger shall  be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or  Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares  are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.2._ 
Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax  or other
Applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest,  to the record holder
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued  in exchange therefor (i) at the
time of such surrender, an  amount equal to all dividends and other
distributions payable in  respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with
a record date  after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to
the  date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at  the
appropriate payment date, an amount equal to the dividends  or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of  Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time  but with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender. For  purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of  shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock  to be issued pursuant to the First Merger (the "
_Stock  Issuance_ ") shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to  the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding  as of the
Effective Time. 

  



  

  (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with  the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ to  pay for shares for which appraisal
rights shall have been  perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  



  

  (h) All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon  conversion of the
Company Common Stock in accordance with the  terms of this Agreement
(including any cash paid pursuant to  _Section 2.3_) shall be deemed to have
been issued and  paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such 
Company Common Stock. 

  



  

  2.3. _Fractional Shares._  

  



  

  (a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be  issued in the
First Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of  shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise entitled to a  fractional share of Parent Common Stock will
be entitled to  receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the 
provisions of this _Section 2.3_, a cash payment in  lieu of such fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock  representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any,  in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
(reduced by  any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in
one  or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to  the
excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent  Common Stock to be
delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent  pursuant to 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  _Section 2.2(a)_ over (ii) the aggregate number  of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock to be distributed to the  holders of Certificates pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_  (such excess being, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The  parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in  lieu of issuing
fractional shares was not separately  bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical  rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense
and  inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the  issuance
of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the  Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of  the Certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock,  shall sell the Excess Shares at then
prevailing prices on the  New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the
manner  provided in the following paragraph. 

  



  

  (b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as  agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional  shares, shall be executed on
the NYSE at then-prevailing market  prices and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent  practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales
have been  distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, 
the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the  holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Common  Stock Trust_ "). The Exchange
Agent shall determine the  portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each
holder of shares  of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by 
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the  Common Stock
Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  amount of the fractional
share interest to which such holder of  shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and  the denominator of which is the aggregate amount
of fractional  share interests to which all holders of shares of Company
Common  Stock would otherwise be entitled. 

  



  

  (c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the  amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of shares of  Company Common Stock in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent  Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such  amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock 
without interest, subject to and in accordance with  _Section 2.2._ 

  



  

  2.4. _Lost Certificates._ If any  Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the  making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person  of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving  Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may  be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the  Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or  destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in  respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by  such Certificate as
contemplated by this _Article II._ 

  



  

  2.5. _Withholding Rights._ Each of  Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to  deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to 
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is  required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of  such payment pursuant to
the Code or under any provision of  federal, state, local or foreign Tax law.
To the extent that  amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger
Sub, the  Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may  be,
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such  deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes  of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the  shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger
Sub, the  Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  



  

  2.6. _Treatment of Stock Options and Other  Incentive Based Awards._  

  



  

  (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to  purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company  Option_ ") granted under the
employee and director equity  and performance incentive plans of the Company
(" _Company  Incentive Plans_ ") or under any individual consultant, 
employee or director agreement or otherwise issued by the  Company, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become fully  exercisable and vested. Immediately following the
Effective  Time, each such Company Option shall be cancelled and, in 
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled  Company Option
shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of  the cancellation of such
Company Option and in settlement  therefor, a payment of the Merger
Consideration (comprised of  Parent Common Stock and cash) equal to the
product of  (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to 
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and  (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value  over the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock  previously subject to such Company Option
(such amounts payable  hereunder being referred to as 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  the " _Option Consideration_ "). " _Merger  Consideration Value_ " shall
mean the sum of (x) the  Per Share Cash Amount and (y) the product of the
Exchange  Ratio and $46.89. Immediately after the Effective Time, any such 
cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the  former holder
thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the  payment of the Option
Consideration as described below. As soon  as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, but in any  event within three (3) business days
following the  Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation to deliver in exchange for each Company Option which  is canceled
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(a)_  (A) an amount in cash equal to the product
of (1) the  Option Consideration and (2) a fraction the numerator of  which
is the Per Share Cash Amount and the denominator of which  is the Merger
Consideration Value, plus (B) a number of  shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to (1) the Option  Consideration less the cash payable pursuant to the
preceding  clause (A), divided by (2) $46.89. The cash and shares  payable
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be subject to  any applicable
withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable  Law to be withheld,
provided that Parent shall at its expense  assist each former holder of a
cancelled Company Option who  received such Company Option in his or her
capacity as a Company  Employee in selling shares of Parent Common Stock
delivered in  payment of the cancelled Stock Option in order to satisfy
such  Taxes with respect to the Option Consideration (whether such 
assistance applies with respect to this  _Section 2.6(a)_ or with respect
to  _Section 2.6(b)_, the " _Assisted Sales  Process_ ") and Parent agrees
that any applicable  withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to
be  withheld in respect of the Option Consideration shall first be 
satisfied from the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock  pursuant to the
Assisted Sales Process and Parent shall only  withhold or cause the
withholding of cash from the cash portion  of an individuals Option
Consideration if and to the  extent that the sale of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant  to the Assisted Sales Process does not yield cash adequate
to  satisfy such tax obligation with respect to such individual.  Prior to
the execution of this Agreement, the Company has  requested that a certain
specified Company Option holder of the  Company identified by Parent enter
into an Option  Exercise and Transaction Support Agreement with the Company 
and Parent in the form that counsel to Parent previously  provided to counsel
to the Company. 

  



  

  (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of  restricted
Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted  Shares_ ") shall vest in full and
then be subject to the  provisions of _Section 2.1(a)._ At the request of
any  holder of Restricted Shares, any applicable withholding or other  Taxes
required by Applicable Law to be withheld as a result of  the operation of
this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be  satisfied by selling, pursuant to the
Assisted Sales Process,  such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is
necessary to  satisfy any such obligation. 

  



  

  (c) Immediately following the Effective Time, all Deferred  Shares (as
defined in the applicable Company Incentive Plan)  shall be converted into a
vested obligation to pay cash with a  value equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration  Value and (ii) the number of Deferred Shares (such
amount,  the " _Deferred Share Consideration"_ ), payable on  a deferred
basis at the time that the underlying Deferred Shares  would have been
settled under their terms as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective
Time, plus earnings thereon  (as described below) (less any required Tax
withholding). From  and after the Effective Time until the applicable payment
date,  the Deferred Share Consideration shall earn interest at a rate  equal
to 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate as  prescribed under Section
1274(d) of the Code. 

  



  

  (d) The value of each performance unit granted under a  Company Incentive
Plan (each, a " _Performance  Unit"_ ) shall become payable at the Effective
Time and  shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable following the 
Effective Time, but in any event within three (3) business  days following
the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the  greater of (1) Par Value (as
defined in the applicable  Company Incentive Plan and any related agreement)
and  (2) the value determined based upon the Companys  actual results for
the applicable performance period through the  Effective Time, with the
amount of such payments determined in  accordance with the applicable Company
Incentive Plan and any  related agreement. 

  



  

  (e) The Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company  shall pass
such resolutions as are reasonably necessary with  respect to the Company
Options, the Restricted Shares, the  Deferred Stock and the Performance Units
to implement the  foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.6_. Such 
resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of  Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,  delayed or conditioned. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and  the Company shall take all necessary
action for the adjustment  of Company Options, Deferred Shares, Restricted
Shares and  Performance Units under this _Section 2.6_. 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (f) It is the intention of Parent and Merger Sub that the  rights of
holders of Company Options, Deferred Shares and  Performance Units to receive
cash payments accrue in and be  allocable to the portion of the day following
the Effective  Time, and that cash payments be deductible as reasonable 
compensation under Section 162 of the Code by the Surviving  Corporation. 

  



  

  2.7. _Dissenting  Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this  Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company  Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have  (i) not voted in favor of the First Merger nor
consented  thereto in writing, (ii) properly complied with the  provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal  rights, or (iii) not effectively
withdrawn or lost its  rights to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting  Share_
"), if any, such holder shall be entitled to  payment, solely from the
Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal  value of the Dissenting Shares to
the extent permitted by and in  accordance with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if any holder of  Dissenting
Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in  accordance with the
DGCL, effectively withdraws or loses  (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to dissent  or its right for appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares,  (y) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
establish  his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or 
(z) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to  take any action the
consequence of which is that such holder is  not entitled to payment for his
shares under the DGCL, such  holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right  to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and
such  shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to  constitute
Dissenting Shares and such shares of Company Common  Stock shall be deemed
converted as of the Effective Time into  the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in  this _Article II_. The Company shall give
Parent  prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for  appraisal
of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall  have the right to
participate in all negotiations and  proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not,  except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not  be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (A)
voluntarily make  any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for 
Dissenting Shares, (B) offer to settle any such demands,  (C) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand  for appraisal in accordance with
the DGCL, or (D) agree to  do any of the foregoing. 

  



  

  2.8. _The Second Merger_. At the  Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and  without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each  issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value  $0.01 per
share, of the First Surviving Corporation issued  and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share  of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the  Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

   ARTICLE III 
   

  



  

   REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND SECOND MERGER
SUB   

  



  

  Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by  Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this  Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ "),  Parent, Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub represent
and warrant  to the Company as follows: 

  



  

  3.1. _Organization and  Standing._ Parent is a corporation duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the 
State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority to  own, lease,
use and operate its properties and to conduct its  business as and where now
owned, leased, used, operated and  conducted. Each of Parents subsidiaries
is an organization  duly incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing
under  the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all  requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own,  lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its  business as and where now owned, leased, used,
operated and  conducted. Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified  to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in 
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property  it owns,
leases or operates requires it to so qualify, except  where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing in such  jurisdiction would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent is not in default in  the performance, observance or fulfillment of
any provision of  Parents Certificate of Incorporation  (" _Parent s
Certificate_"), or Parents  Bylaws (" _Parent s Bylaws_"). No subsidiary 
of Parent is in default in the performance, observance or  fulfillment of any
provision of such subsidiarys  certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
similar organizational  documents, except as would not, individually or in
the  aggregate, have a 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has heretofore  furnished or
made available to the Company complete and correct  copies of Parents
Certificate and Parents Bylaws. 

  



  

  3.2. _Corporate Power and  Authority._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Second  Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to  enter
into and deliver this Agreement, to perform its  obligations under this
Agreement, and, subject to (a) the  Parent Stockholder Approval and (b) the
approval of Parent  in its capacity as the sole stockholder of each of Merger
Sub,  the First Surviving Corporation and Second Merger Sub (which, in  the
case of this clause (b), Parent shall obtain reasonably  promptly), to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. The execution,
performance and delivery of this  Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub have been  duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of  each of Parent, Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, subject to 
(i) the Parent Stockholder Approval, (ii) the filing  of the Certificate of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of  State and (iii) the filing of the
Second Certificate of  Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, and no
other  corporate proceedings on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or  Second
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize or approve this  Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.  This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered  by each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Second Merger Sub, and,  assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the  Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of  each of Parent, Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub enforceable  against
each of them in accordance with its terms, except that  such enforceability
(a) may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting or  relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally  and (b) is subject to general principles of equity. 

  



  

  3.3. _Capitalization of Parent._ As  of the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of  Parent consists of 100,000,000 shares of Parent
Common  Stock and 3,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value  $0.01 per
share (" _Parent Preferred  Stock_ "). At the close of business on March
30,  2007, (a) 53,003,966 shares of Parent Common Stock  were issued and
outstanding, (b) no shares of Parent  Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding and  (c) 52,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and no shares  of
Parent Preferred Stock were held in treasury by Parent or by  subsidiaries of
Parent. All of the outstanding shares of capital  stock of Parent have been
duly authorized and validly issued and  are fully paid and nonassessable. As
of the close of business on  March 30, 2007, other than (i) options to
purchase  2,186,753 shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to  Parent
Benefit Plans, (ii) 1,628,774 restricted shares of  Parent Common Stock, and
(iii) 119,778 shares of  Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of
restricted stock  units and director deferred stock awards, (x) there are
no  options, warrants, rights, puts, calls, commitments or other  contracts,
arrangements or understandings issued by or binding  upon Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent requiring or providing  for, and (y) there are no
outstanding debt or equity  securities of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
which upon the  conversion, exchange or exercise thereof would require or 
provide for the issuance by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent  of any new or
additional shares of Parent Common Stock (or any  other securities of Parent
or any subsidiary of Parent) which,  with or without notice, lapse of time 
and/or  payment of monies, are or would be convertible into or  exercisable
or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock (or any  other securities of Parent
or any subsidiary of Parent). Except  as set forth on _Section 3.3_ of the
Parent Disclosure  Schedule, since March 30, 2007 through the date of this 
Agreement, neither Parent has nor any subsidiary of Parent  thereof has
issued any shares of its capital stock or any  securities convertible into or
exercisable for any shares of its  capital stock or pursuant to the exercise
or vesting of  incentive equity grants or conversion of the securities 
described in clauses (i)-(iii) of the immediately preceding  sentence. The
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the  First Merger will, upon
issuance, be validly issued, fully paid,  nonassessable, not subject to any
preemptive rights, and free  and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges or  other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever (in each case
to  which Parent is a party). 

  



  

  3.4. _Capitalization of Merger Sub and Second  Merger Sub._  

  



  

  (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized  capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of  common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, all of which  shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and  outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Effective  Time and the Second Effective Time will be, owned directly by 
Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the  date of this
Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective  Time will have no, assets,
liabilities or obligations of any  nature other than those incident to its
formation and pursuant  to this Agreement. 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (b) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized  capital stock of
Second Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares  of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, all of which  shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of
the issued and  outstanding capital stock of Second Merger Sub is, and at
the  Effective Time and the Second Effective Time will be, owned  directly
by Parent. Second Merger Sub has not conducted any  business prior to the
date of this Agreement and has no, and  prior to the Second Effective Time
will have no, assets,  liabilities or obligations of any nature other than

  3.6. _Parent SEC Documents._  

  



  

  (a) Parent and its subsidiaries have timely filed with the  Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  " _Commission_ ") all registration statements, 
prospectuses, forms, reports, schedules, statements and other  documents (as
supplemented and amended since the time of filing,  collectively, the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ ")  required to be filed by them since December 31,
2005 under  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with 
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  " _Exchange Act_ "),
or the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated  thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). The Parent 
SEC Documents, including any financial statements or schedules  included in
the Parent SEC Documents, at the time filed (and, in  the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the  dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively,  and, in the case of any Parent SEC
Document amended or  superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then  on the date of such amending or superseding filing) (i)
did  not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to  state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary  in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and  (ii) complied in all material respects with the
applicable  requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the 
case may be. The consolidated financial statements of Parent and  its
subsidiaries included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly  present (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to  normal, recurring audit adjustments)
in all material respects  the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its  consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  consolidated results of their operations and cash flows (and  changes in
financial position, if any) for the periods then  ended in conformity with
United States generally accepted  accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "). None
of  Parents subsidiaries is subject to the periodic reporting  requirements
of the Exchange Act or required to file any form,  report or other document

comparable Governmental  Authority. 

  



  

  (b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure  controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in  paragraphs (e) and (f) in  Rule
13a-14  under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures 
are reasonably designed to ensure that material information  required to be
disclosed by Parent in its reports that it files  or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the time
period specified in the  rules and forms of the Commission, and that all such
material  information is accumulated and communicated to Parents 
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding  required
disclosure and to make the certifications required  pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). 
Parents management has completed assessment of the  effectiveness of
Parents internal control over financial  reporting in material compliance
with the requirements of  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended  December 29, 2006, and such assessment concluded that such  controls
were effective. There are no outstanding loans made by  Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to any executive officer (as  defined in  Rule 3b-7  under the
Exchange Act) or director of Parent. Since the  enactment of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, neither Parent nor any of  its subsidiaries has made any loans to
any executive officer (as  defined in  Rule 3b-7  under the Exchange Act)
or director of Parent or any of its  subsidiaries.

3.9(b)_, comply as to form in all material  respects with the applicable

statements therein not misleading. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, no

this  Agreement shall be in full force and effect without penalty or  other
adverse consequence, except where the failure to be valid,  binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect would not,  individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect  on Parent and to the extent as may
be limited by applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
affecting the  enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general 
principles of equity. Parent has not received any written notice  from any
other party to any Parent Material Contract, and  otherwise has no knowledge

condition which upon the passage of time or the giving  of notice or both

its subsidiaries or, to  Parents knowledge, by any third party), except
for  violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

in which the nature of the  business conducted by it or the property it owns,
leases or  operates requires it to so qualify, except where the failure to

fulfillment of any provision of the  Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company  (the " _Company s Certificate"_) or the 
Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws (the  " _Company s Bylaws"_). No

subsidiary) of each of its subsidiaries. Each of the  outstanding shares of
capital stock of each of the  Companys subsidiaries is duly authorized,

  4.6. _Company SEC Documents._  

  



  

  (a) The Company and its subsidiaries have timely filed with  the
Commission all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,  reports,
schedules, statements and other documents (as  supplemented and amended since
the time of filing, collectively,  the " _Company SEC Documents"_ ) required
to be  filed by them since December 31, 2005 under the Exchange  Act or the
Securities Act. The Company SEC Documents, including  any financial
statements or schedules included in the Company  SEC Documents, at the time
filed (and, in the case of  registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of  effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively, and, in 
the case of any Company SEC Document amended or superseded by a  filing prior
to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of  such amending or
superseding filing) (i) did not contain  any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a  material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in  order to make the statements therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and  (ii) complied
in all material respects with the applicable  requirements of the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act, as the  case may be. The consolidated financial
statements of the  Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly
present  (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, 
recurring audit adjustments) in all material respects the  consolidated
financial position of the Company and its  consolidated subsidiaries as at
the dates thereof and the  consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows (and  changes in financial position, if any) for the periods then 
ended in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the  unaudited
statements, as permitted by the Commission) applied on  a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be  indicated therein or in the
notes thereto). None of the  Companys subsidiaries is subject to the
periodic reporting  requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file any
form,  report or other document with the Commission, the NYSE, any  other
stock exchange or any other comparable Governmental  Authority. 

  



  

  (b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure  controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in  paragraphs (e) and (f) in  Rule
13a-14  under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures 
are reasonably designed to ensure that material information  required to be
disclosed by the Company in its reports that it  files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded,  processed, summarized and reported within the time
period  specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and that all 
such material information is accumulated and communicated to the  Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely  decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the  certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has  completed
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys  internal control 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of  Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended  December 29, 2006, and such
assessment concluded that such  controls were effective. There are no
outstanding loans made by  the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any
executive officer  (as defined in  Rule 3b-7  under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company. Since the  enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,

director of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries.

consents, certificates, approvals and orders of all  Governmental Authorities
necessary for the lawful conduct of  their respective businesses (the "
_Company  Permits"_ ), except for failures to hold such Company  Permits
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a  Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company and its  subsidiaries are in compliance
with the terms of the Company  Permits, except where the failure so to comply
would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect  on the Company. The businesses of the Company and its  subsidiaries
are not being conducted in violation of any  Applicable Law, except for
violations that would not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect  on the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
_Section 4.7(a)_, no representation or warranty shall  be deemed to be made
in this _Section 4.7(a)_ in  respect of the matters referenced in _Sections
4.6_,  _4.9_ , _4.18_ and _4.27_ , or in respect of  environmental, Tax,

  (b) No investigation or review by any Governmental  Authority with respect
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries  is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened, nor  has any Governmental Authority indicated in
writing an intention  to conduct any such investigation or review, other
than, in each  case, those the outcome of which would not, individually or
in  the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which  they were
made, not misleading.

trustee to administer, any such Company Benefit  Plan. 

  



  

  (g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,  have a

other welfare benefits to current or former employees  or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof.

Foreign Plan. 

  



  

  (j) There are no pending, or, to the knowledge of the  Company,
threatened, Actions (other than claims for benefits in  the ordinary course)
that have been asserted or instituted  against any Company Benefit Plan, any

Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

affiliates, officers or  directors should be discovered by the Company,
Parent or Merger  Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to  the  Form S-4  or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of
such  documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact  or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the  statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or an
event occurs which is  required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the  Form S-4  or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the party that 
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party  and an

case, derivative securities) resulting from the transactions  contemplated
hereby by each individual who is subject to the  reporting requirements of

party and its subsidiaries. No information or  knowledge obtained by any
party in any investigation pursuant to  this _Section 5.1(g)_ shall affect or
be deemed to  modify any representation or warranty made by the other party

shall be required to afford such access if it would  unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Company or any of its subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its 
subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which  the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or Parent or any of its  subsidiaries is a party,

subsidiaries. Parent hereby  agrees that all information provided to it or

Company and Parent and the  members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such  approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so  that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as 
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and  otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such  statute or regulation on the

the other party  hereto of (i) the occurrence or non occurrence of any
event  that, to the knowledge of such party, has caused (A) any 
representation or warranty of such party contained in this  Agreement to be
materially untrue or inaccurate as of the date  of this Agreement, (B) any
condition to the obligations of  such party to effect the Transaction and the

other  communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such 
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any material notice  or other

_Section 5.1(j)_ shall not  cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring  disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement, 
affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any condition to  the
Transaction set forth in this Agreement or otherwise limit  or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party  receiving such notice.

opinions of counsel referred to in  _Sections 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)._ Each  of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub shall  use their
respective reasonable best efforts not to, and shall  use their reasonable
best efforts not to permit any of their  respective subsidiaries to, take any
action (including any  action otherwise permitted by this _Section 5.1(k)_)

"reorganization" within the meaning of  Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided
the opinion conditions  contained in _Sections 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_ have

the  Form S-4  promptly following the Closing. 

  



  

  (ii) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a  "determination" within the

Company shall report the Transaction for U.S. federal  income tax purposes as
a "reorganization" within the  meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  
 #####

Company, and Parent shall use  its reasonable best efforts to deliver to

Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing  Date and signed by an

Agreement and  Latham and Watkins LLP to render the opinion described  in
_Section 6.2(d)_ of this Agreement.

  (b) _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers  Insurance._

current or former directors, officers  or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its  subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate
of  incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents or in  any
agreement shall survive the First Merger and the Second  Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. For six  (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, to the fullest  extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent
and the Surviving  Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation, 
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the  Companys and
any of its subsidiaries certificates of  incorporation and bylaws or similar
organization documents in  effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any  indemnification agreements of the Company or its subsidiaries  with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees in  effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not  amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any  manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any  individuals who at the Effective Time
were current or former  directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its  subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights  to
indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted  or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the  disposition of such Action
or resolution of such claim. From and  after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, be jointly and  severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand
surety for,  and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective  terms, each of
the agreements contained in this  _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ without limit as to
time. 

  



  

  (ii) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall  cause the
Surviving Corporation (including providing funding),  to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law, indemnify  and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the  foregoing) each current and former director
or officer of the  Company or any of its subsidiaries and each such Person
who  served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of  another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension  or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise at the request of  the Company (each, together
with such Persons heirs,  executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified 
Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including  advancing attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the  final disposition of any Action to each
Indemnified Party to the  fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines,
losses,  claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in 
connection with any actual or threatened Action, arising out of,  relating to
or in connection with any action or omission  occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after  the Effective Time related to the fact that
such Person was a  director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or  anything done or not done by such Person in such capacity 
(including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons  serving as an
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity  if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the  Company). In the event of any such
Action, Parent and the  Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party  in the defense of any such Action. Neither Parent nor
the  Surviving Corporation shall settle any such Action without the  prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party unless the  Surviving Corporation
assumes full responsibility for such  settlement, the settlement grants the
Indemnified Party a  complete release in respect of the potential liability
relating  to the claims underlying such Action and the terms of such 
settlement are not in any way detrimental to the Indemnified  Party and such
settlement does not contain any admission  detrimental to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party  shall not settle any such Action without the
prior written  consent of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (which shall
not  be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such 
settlement does not provide for monetary damages, the terms of  such
settlement are not in any way detrimental to Parent or the  Surviving
Corporation and such settlement does not contain any  admission detrimental
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In  the event of any payment under
this  _Section 5.2(b)(ii)_, the Surviving Corporation shall  be subrogated
to the extent of such payment to all rights of  recovery of the Indemnified
Party with respect to any insurance  covering any such liability (including
the insurance set forth  in _Section 5.2(b)(iii)_). 

  



  

  (iii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to obtain
and maintain in effect, for a period of  six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the existing  policies of directors and officers liability 
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance on behalf of the  former officers
and directors of the Company currently covered  by the Companys directors
and officers  liability insurance policy with respect to acts or omissions 
occurring prior to the Effective Time or such policies with  substantially
the same coverage and containing substantially  similar terms and conditions
as existing policies; _provided,  however_ , that if the aggregate annual
premiums for such  insurance at any time during such period shall exceed 250%
of  the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company and its  subsidiaries
as of the date of this Agreement for such  insurance, then Parent shall or
shall cause its subsidiaries to,  provide only such coverage as shall then be
available at an  annual premium equal to 250% of such rate. 

  



  

  (iv) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including  reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any  Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other  obligations provided in this _Section 5.2(b)._ 

  



  

  (v) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be  in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such  Indemnified Party may
have under the certificate of  incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the  Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation,  any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. 
The provisions of this _Section 5.2(b)_ shall survive  the consummation of
the Transaction and expressly are intended  to benefit, and are enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified  Parties. 

  



  

  (vi) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any  of their
respective successors or assigns (x) consolidates  with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the  continuing or surviving corporation 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  or entity in such consolidation or merger or (y) Transfers  all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any  Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be  made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the  obligations set forth in this _Section 5.2(b)._ 

  



  

  (c) _Parent Acquisition Proposals._  

  



  

  (i) Subject to _Sections 5.2(c)(ii)_ through  _5.2(c)(v)_ , Parent agrees
that neither it nor any of its  subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best  efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries employees, 
agents and representatives (including any investment banker,  attorney or
accountant (" _Representatives_ ")  retained by it or any of its
subsidiaries) not to, directly or  indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage  any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, a
Parent  Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in any negotiations  concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to  any Person relating to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal,  (C) approve or recommend or propose publicly to
approve or  recommend, any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (D) approve  or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or  enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger  agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other  similar agreement relating to any
Parent Acquisition Proposal or  propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing relating to  any Parent Acquisition Proposal. 

  



  

  (ii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent  Parent or Parents
Board from complying with its disclosure  obligations under  Sections
14d-9  and 14e-2 of  the Exchange Act; _provided, however,_ that if such 
disclosure has the effect of withdrawing, modifying or  qualifying the
approval of this Agreement by Parents Board  or the Parent Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to the  Company or the approval of this
Agreement by the Parents  Stockholders, the Company shall have the right to
terminate this  Agreement to the extent set forth in _Section 7.3(c)._ 

  



  

  (iii) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in  _Section 5.2(c)(i)_,
until the earlier of receipt of  the Parent Stockholder Approval and the
Termination Date, if  Parent receives a Parent Acquisition Proposal which 
(A) constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, or  (B) which the Board of Parent
determines in good faith  could reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Superior  Proposal, Parent may take the following actions:  (x) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party making  such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so  furnishing such information, Parent
receives from the third  party an executed confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality  provisions no less favorable to Parent than the letter 
agreement, dated as of February 14, 2007, between the  Company and Parent and
the letter agreement, dated as of  April 13, 2007, between the Company and
Parent and  (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third  party
with respect to the Parent Acquisition Proposal. 

  



  

  (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent  Parent or Parents Board from, at
any time prior, but not  after, the time the Stock Issuance is approved by
Parents  Stockholders at the Parent Stockholder Meeting, recommending  such
an unsolicited bona fide written Parent Acquisition  Proposal to Parents
Stockholders, if and only to the  extent that, (A) the Board of Parent
determines in good  faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that  failing to do so could reasonably be expected to constitute a  breach
of the Board of the Parents fiduciary duties under  Applicable Law; and (B)
Parents Board determines in  good faith that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal (in the form,  other than immaterial changes, that was the subject
of the  Parent Superior Proposal Notice, as defined below)  constitutes a
Parent Superior Proposal and the Company shall  have received written notice
(the " _Parent Superior  Proposal Notice_") of Parents intention to  take
such action at least four business days prior to the taking  of such action
by Parent and has complied with its other  obligations under this _Section
5.2(c)(iv)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents Board  continues to
believe, after taking into account any  modifications to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by  this Agreement that are proposed by the Company
after its  receipt of the Parent Superior Proposal Notice that such  Parent
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior  Proposal. If there is a
Parent Change of Recommendation as a  result of a Parent Acquisition Proposal
that is a Parent  Superior Proposal and Parents Board recommends such an 
unsolicited bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal  pursuant to this
clause (iv), Parent shall be entitled to  terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.4(b)._ 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (v) Parent agrees that it will immediately cease and cause  to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or  negotiations with any
Person (other than the parties hereto)  conducted heretofore with respect to
any Parent Acquisition  Proposal. Parent agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to  promptly inform the officers, directors, employees and 
Representatives of Parent and its subsidiaries of the  obligations undertaken
in this _Section 5.2(c)._ 

  



  

  (vi) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent  shall promptly
orally notify the Company of any request for  information or any inquiries,
proposals or offers relating to a  Parent Acquisition Proposal indicating, in
connection with such  notice, the name of such Person making such request,
inquiry,  proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any 
proposals or offers and Parent shall provide to the Company  written notice
of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within  forty-eight (48) hours of such
event and copies of any  written or electronic correspondence to or from any
Person  making a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall keep the  Company
informed orally on a current basis of the status of any  Parent Acquisition
Proposal, including with respect to the  status and terms of any such
proposal or offer and whether any  such proposal or offer has been withdrawn
or rejected and Parent  shall provide to the Company written notice of any
such  developments (including copies of any written proposals or  requests
for information) within forty-eight (48) hours.  Parent also agrees to
provide any information to the Company  (not previously provided to the
Company) that it is providing to  another Person pursuant to this _Section
5.2(c)(vii)_  at substantially the same time it provides such information
to  such other Person. 

  



  

  (vii) For purposes of this Agreement: 

  



  

  (A) _" _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ "_  means any proposal or offer with
respect to (1) a merger,  reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business  combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or 
similar transaction involving Parent, (2) any purchase of  an equity interest
(including by means of a tender or exchange  offer) representing an amount
equal to or greater than a 15%  voting or economic interest in Parent, or (3)
any purchase  of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an 
amount equal to or greater than 15% of the consolidated assets  of Parent and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole (including stock  of the subsidiaries of
Parent), consolidated net revenues or  earnings before interest, Taxes,
depreciation and amortization. 

  



  

  (B) _" _Parent Superior Proposal_ "_  means a bona fide written Parent
Acquisition Proposal (except  that references in the definition of the
"Parent  Acquisition Proposal" to 15% shall be replaced by 50%) made  by any
Person other than a party hereto on terms that the Board  of Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with  Parents financial and
legal advisors, and considering such  factors as the Board of Parent
considers to be appropriate  (including the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such  proposal), are more favorable to Parent and its
stockholders  than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  



  

  (d) _Employees and Employee Benefits._  

  



  

  (i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause  the Surviving
Corporation to honor the obligations of the  Company and any of its
subsidiaries as of the Effective Time  under the terms of all Company Benefit
Plans and Company Foreign  Plans listed on _Section 4.14(b)_ of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ that this provision shall  not prevent the
First Surviving Corporation from amending,  suspending or terminating any
such Plans to the extent permitted  by the applicable terms of such Company
Benefit Plan and Company  Foreign Plan. 

  



  

  (ii) Until December 31, 2008, Parent shall provide or  shall cause to be
provided to each Company Employee compensation  and benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar  to the compensation and benefits provided
to such Company  Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For  purposes of this _Section 5.2(d)_, the term  " _Company Employees_ "
means individuals who are,  as of the Effective Time, employees of the
Company and its  subsidiaries not subject to collective bargaining agreements
and  who following the Effective Time continue such employment with  the
Company, Parent or their respective subsidiaries. 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (iii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,  eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the  employee plans and benefit
arrangements of Parent and its  subsidiaries in which any Company Employee
participates on or  after the Effective Time (" _New Plans_ "), Parent 
shall (A) use reasonable best efforts to waive all  pre-existing condition
exclusions, actively at work requirements  and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage  requirements applicable to the Company
Employees and their  covered dependents under any such New Plans, except to
the  extent such conditions would have been recognized under the 
corresponding Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan,  (B) recognize
service of the Company Employees which was  credited under corresponding
Company Benefit Plans or Company  Foreign Plans as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time for  purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals
under the  New Plans (but not (1) for purposes of benefit accrual  under any
defined benefit or pension plan, (2) to the  extent such credited service
would result in a duplication of  benefits with respect to the same period of
service or  (3) under any newly established New Plan for which  similarly
situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries are  not provided with
credit for past service), and (C) credit  any deductibles, co-payments or
other  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by a Company Employee or his or her
covered  dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company 
Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan ending on the date such  employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan  begins to be recognized under
such New Plan for purposes of  satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum  out-of-pocket  requirements applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her  covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such 
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Nothing  contained in
this Agreement shall restrict the ability of Parent  and its affiliates to
terminate the employment of any Company  Employee for any reason at any time
after the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (iv) For a period of two (2) years following the  Effective Time, Parent
agrees to continue or cause the Surviving  Corporation to continue the
Companys retiree welfare  programs, including medical prescription drugs and
retiree life  insurance program (the " _Company Retiree Welfare  Programs_
") on terms and conditions no less favorable in  duration, scope, value,
participant cost, vesting and otherwise  than those in effect as of the
Effective Time with respect to  all Company Employees who (x) as of the time
immediately  prior to the Effective Time are receiving benefits under the 
Company Retiree Welfare Programs or (y) as of the time  immediately prior to
the Effective Time would be eligible to  receive benefits under the Company
Retiree Welfare Programs as  of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in connection with the foregoing  commitment,
Parent shall not be required to incur costs in  excess of the accrued benefit
cost with respect to such Company  Welfare Programs reflected in Note 8 to
the Companys  Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Companys 
Form 10-K  for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2006. 

  



  

  (v) Unless earlier required pursuant to any Company Benefit  Plan or
Company Foreign Plan (in which case the payment  contemplated hereby shall be
made at such earlier time), no  later than March 15, 2008, Parent shall, or
shall cause the  Company or the Surviving Corporation, to pay each Company 
Employee employed by Parent, the Company or one of their  subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time and on December 31,  2007 and participating as of the
Effective Time in any Company  Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan that is
an annual incentive  plan (an " _Incentive Plan_ ") (unless following  the
Effective Time and prior to December 31, 2007 such  Company Employee, dies,
becomes Disabled (as defined below), is  involuntarily terminated by Parent,
the Company or one of their  subsidiaries, other than for "cause," or retires
after  (x) reaching age 65, (y) reaching age 55  with ten years or more of
service, or (z) after  30 years of service, in which case the Company
Employee or  his or her estate shall be entitled to the payment provided in 
this _Section 5.2(d)(v)_ whether or not he or she is  employed by Parent, the
Company or one of their subsidiaries as  of December 31, 2007), a payment
equal to the greater of  the following amounts: (A) the product of (1) the 
Company Employees full-year incentive entitlement under  all such Incentive
Plans based on actual performance levels as  of the Effective Date,
determined in good faith, consistent with  the Companys past practice and
based on applicable metrics  under the Incentive Plans and (2) a fraction,
the numerator  of which shall equal the number of days in the calendar year 
through the first to occur of the Effective Date and  December 31, 2007 and
the denominator of which is 365, and  (B) the Company Employees full-year
incentive  entitlement under all such Incentive Plans based on actual 
performance levels for the full plan year ending as of  December 31, 2007,
determined in good faith, consistent  with the Companys past practice and
based on applicable  metrics under the Incentive Plans. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if any Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan  provides for
a greater 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  or earlier payment than the payments contemplated by this  _Section
5.2(d)(v)_, then such Company Benefit Plan or  Company Foreign Plan shall
govern the applicable payment, rather  than this _Section 5.2(d)(v)_; it
being understood  that Parent shall honor and shall cause the Company to
honor,  without amendment, the severance arrangements set forth on  _Section
5.2(d)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure  Schedule. For purposes of this _Section
5.2(d)(v)_, a  Company Employee shall be deemed " _Disabled_ " if  (x) the
Company Employee is unable to engage in any  substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment that can
be expected  to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous 
period of not less than 12 months or (y) the Company  Employee is, by reason
of any medically determinable physical or  mental impairment that can be
expected to result in death or can  be expected to last for a continuous
period of not less than  12 months, receiving income replacement benefits for
a  period of not less than three months under an accident and  health plan
covering employees of the Parent, the Company or one  of their subsidiaries.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing  contained in this _Section 5.2(d)(v)_
shall result in  the duplication of any Incentive Plan payment with respect
to  any Company Employee. 

  



  

  (vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in  this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as  an amendment or other
modification of any Company Benefit Plan  or Company Foreign Plan, or shall
limit the right of the  Surviving Corporation to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify  any Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in
accordance  with its terms following the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that this _Section 5.2(d)(vi)_ shall  not affect Parents
obligations set forth in  _Section 5.2(d)(v)._ In the event that (A) a 
party other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of  their
respective subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other  action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement as an  amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Foreign Plan,  and (B) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to
such  Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan even though not 
explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such  provision shall
lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory  effect. 

  



  

  (vii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and  agree that all
provisions contained in this  _Section 5.2(d)_ with respect to employees
are  included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the  Company,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or  implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other  rights (A) in any other Person,
including, without  limitation, any director, officer or employee of the
Company,  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective 
affiliates, any former employees, any participant in any Company  Plan, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to  continued employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or  any of their respective affiliates. 

  



  

  (e) _Form S-4._ Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent shall  prepare and file with the Commission under the Securities Act 
the  Form S-4,  and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the 
Form S-4  to be declared effective by the Commission a sufficient time 
prior to the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting to allow  the Company
and Parent to mail the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus to their respective
stockholders, as  required by the rules and regulations of the Commission,
prior  to the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder 
Meeting, as applicable. 

  



  

  (f) _Stock Exchange Listing._ Parent shall  use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent  Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the First Merger to  be listed on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance,  prior to the Closing Date. 

  



  

  (g) _The Parent Stockholder Meeting; The Parent s  Board Recommendation._
Parent shall, as promptly  as practicable after the  Form S-4  is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give  notice of, convene and
hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting.  Parents Board shall take all lawful
action to solicit the  approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common
Stock in the  First Merger by Parents Stockholders, and Parents  Board
shall make the Parent Board Recommendation. Subject to  this _Section
5.2(g)_, the Parent Board Recommendation  shall be included in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and  Parents Board shall take all lawful action
to solicit the  approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the  First Merger by Parents Stockholders. In the event that  subsequent to
the date of this Agreement, Parents Board  determines in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel  that failing to do so could reasonably be
expected to constitute  a breach of Parents Boards fiduciary duties under 
Applicable Law, Parents Board may withdraw, modify or  qualify the Parent
Board Recommendation (" _Parent Change  of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that Parents Board may not 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  recommend any Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than this  Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including  the Transaction), except as
specifically contemplated by, and in  accordance with, _Section
5.2(c)(iv)_;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that unless  this
Agreement is theretofore validly terminated, Parent shall  nevertheless
submit this Agreement to Parents Stockholders  for adoption at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall use  its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Parent Stockholder  Meeting as soon as practicable after the  Form S-4 
becomes effective and to obtain Parent Stockholder Approval.  Parent shall
otherwise coordinate and cooperate with the Company  with respect to the
timing of the Parent Stockholder Meeting and  will otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to  the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
may adjourn or  postpone the Parent Stockholder Meeting to the extent
necessary  to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the 
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its stockholders  in advance
of the vote to be held at the Parent Stockholder  Meeting or, if as of the
time for which the Parent Stockholder  Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Joint Proxy  Statement/ Prospectus) there are insufficient
shares of Parent  Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy)
to  constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the  Parent
Stockholder Meeting. 

  



  

  (h) _Parent s Board._ Parent shall  take all such action as may be
necessary to cause the number of  directors comprising Parents Board at the
Effective Time  to be sufficient to permit one director of the Company, who,
as  of the date of this Agreement, is a director of the Company and  who
shall be chosen by Parent in its sole discretion prior to  the Effective
Time, to serve as a director of Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
candidate shall be  considered, qualified and approved in accordance with
the  current procedures of Parents nominating committee or  other
applicable governing standards of Parents Board, and  such process shall be
completed by Parent prior to the Effective  Time. 

  



  

  (i) _Financing._ Each of Parent and Merger  Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the  Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Financing  Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts 
(i) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto  on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing  Commitments, (ii) to satisfy all
conditions applicable to  Parent in such definitive agreements, (iii) to
comply with  its obligations under the Financing Commitments and (iv) to 
enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments. Parent shall  give the
Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of any  material breach by any
party of the Financing Commitments or any  termination of the Financing
Commitments. Parent shall keep the  Company informed on a reasonable basis
and in reasonable detail  of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and shall  not permit any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any  waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Financing 
Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy  reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing (other than  immaterial reductions), amends
the conditions to the drawdown of  the Financing in an adverse manner or is
adverse to the  interests of the Company in any other respect. In the event
that  Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes 
procurement of any portion of the Financing unlikely to occur in  the manner
or from the sources contemplated in the Financing  Commitments, Parent shall
immediately notify the Company and  Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best  efforts to arrange any such portion from
alternative sources. 

  



  

  (j) _Third-Party Standstill  Agreements._ During the period from the date
of  this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the 
Termination Date: (i) Parent shall not (and shall not agree  to, and shall
not permit any of its subsidiaries to or to agree  to) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any  confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any of  its subsidiaries is a party (other than any involving
the  Company or its subsidiaries and confidentiality agreements  pertaining
solely to ordinary course commercial matters); and  (ii) Parent shall
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted  under Applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreements,  including obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such  confidentiality or standstill agreements and
enforcing  specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of 
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

to terminate this  Agreement to the extent set forth in _Section 7.4(c)._

recommending

Companys Stockholders, if and only to the  extent that, (A) the Board of the

counsel,  that failing to do so could reasonably be expected to constitute

Law; and (B) the Companys Board  determines in good faith that such Company
Acquisition Proposal  (in the form, other than immaterial changes, that was
the  subject of the Company Superior Proposal Notice)  constitutes a Company

such action at least four (4) business days prior  to the taking of such
action by the Company and has complied  with its other obligations under

proposed by Parent after  its receipt of the Company Superior Proposal Notice
that  such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior 
Proposal. If there is a Company Change of Recommendation as a  result of a
Company Acquisition Proposal that is a Company  Superior Proposal and the

Acquisition Proposal  pursuant to this clause (iv), the Company shall be
entitled  to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.3(b)._

conditions of any  proposals or offers and the Company shall provide to

status of any  Company Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the 
status and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any  such proposal
or offer has been withdrawn or rejected and the  Company shall provide to

written proposals or  requests for information) within forty-eight (48)
hours.  The Company also agrees to provide any information to Parent  (not
previously provided to Parent) that it is providing to  another Person

and legal advisors, and considering  such factors as the Board of the Company
considers to be  appropriate (including the timing and likelihood of
consummation  of such proposal), are more favorable to the Company and its 
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, taking
into account any change in the transaction  proposed by Parent.

  (d) _Financing._ The Company agrees to  provide, and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause its  subsidiaries and Representatives (including legal

Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under  Applicable Law,
the provisions of any such agreements, including  obtaining injunctions to
prevent any breaches of such  confidentiality or standstill agreements and

  8.8. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Specific  Performance; Venue._  

  



  

  (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur  in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were  not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were  otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties  shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms  and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the
Delaware  Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that 
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such  Action, in
the United States District Court for the District of  Delaware. The parties
hereto further agree to waive any  requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in  connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other 
equitable relief. In addition, each of the parties hereto  irrevocably agrees
that any legal Action with respect to this  Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or  for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of  this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder  brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, 
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware  Court of
Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that  such court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction over such  Action, in the United States
District Court for the District of  Delaware. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits  with regard to any such Action for itself and in
respect of its  property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal 
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not  bring any
Action relating to this Agreement or any of the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other  than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
parties hereto hereby  irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion,  as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with 
respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not  personally subject
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts  for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance  with this _Section 8.8_, (b) any claim that
it or  its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such  court
or from any legal process commenced in such courts  (whether through service
of notice, attachment prior to  judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution  of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest
extent  permitted by the Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the  Action in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,  (ii) the venue of such
Action is improper or  (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this 
Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  



  

  (b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby  consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set  forth in _Section 8.2_ and
agrees that service of any  process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail (return  receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid)
to the  respective addresses set forth in _Section 8.2_ shall  be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in  connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. 

  



  

  8.9. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF  THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL  BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO  THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS  AGREEMENT. 

  



  

  8.10. _Assignment._ Neither this  Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under  this Agreement shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto  (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior  written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the 
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the  parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

  



  

  8.11. _Amendment._ This Agreement may  be amended by the parties hereto at
any time before or after  approval of the First Merger by the Companys
Stockholders;  _provided, however_ , that after any such approval, no 
amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by  the
Companys Stockholders without such approval having  been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an  instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties  hereto. 

  



  

  8.12. _Extension; Waiver._ At any  time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may  (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the 
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive  any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained  in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto  or (c) subject to the proviso of _Section
8.11_,  waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions  contained
in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a  party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set  forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such  party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any  of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not  constitute a waiver of such rights and the single or partial 
exercise of any rights of this Agreement shall not preclude any  other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other  right, power or
privilege. 

  



  

  8.13. _Severability._ Any term or  provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in  any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective  to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without  rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and 
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any  provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable,  such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is  enforceable.
