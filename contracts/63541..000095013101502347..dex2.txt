arrangements,  and (y) determining vacation and severance benefits; provided,
however,  -------- -------  that subject to Section 5.13(c), Transferring

obligations under medical and other welfare benefit plans sponsored by 
Seller, Global or any Affiliate thereof as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA

Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Buyer  -----  Welfare Plans"), in accordance with
the terms of such plans. Buyer shall  -------------  not provide benefit

terms of the applicable Welfare Plan.   (iv) Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold Seller harmless from and  against any and all claims for severance with
respect to Transferring  Employees arising out of Buyer\'s termination of a
Transferring Employee  after the Closing Date.   (c) Bargaining Unit
Employees.  -------------------------   (i) Seller is a party to the
Collective Bargaining Agreements. On  and after the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees to perform all rights, duties, and  obligations imposed on an employer
by the Collective Bargaining Agreements  with respect to the performance of
services by Transferring Bargaining Unit  Employees on and after the Closing
Date and by the Amana Refrigeration,  Inc. Iowa Bargaining Unit Pension Plan
(the "Pension Plan") in accordance  ------------  with Section 5.13(c)(iii),
but only if the applicable union agrees to the  -------------------- 
continued application of such agreements pursuant to their terms after the 
Closing Date. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and 
against any claims made by any Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee or 
collective bargaining representative which arise out of or relate to the

Employees or their dependents prior to the Closing Date shall be covered 
under the Seller Welfare Plans; and claims by Transferring Bargaining Unit 
Employees or their dependents for life insurance, accidental death and 
dismemberment and disability benefits with respect to death, disability or 
other injury occurring on or after the Closing Date shall be covered under 
the Buyer Welfare Plans, subject to the limitations thereof (but in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and claims for such benefits 
with respect to death, disability or injury occurring prior to the Closing 
Date shall be covered under the Seller Welfare Plans. The amount and type  of

and (y) determining  vacation and severance benefits, provided, however,  
-54-    that except as provided in subsection (iii)(A) below,
Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employees shall not be credited for Past
Service for  purposes of any defined benefit plan of Buyer. Buyer will give
credit to  Transferring Bargaining Unit Employees for earned but unused
vacation and  accrued vacation determined as of the Closing Date and an
appropriate  accrual therefor will be set forth on the Closing Date Pro Forma
Balance  Sheet. Transferring Bargaining Unit Employees will also receive
credit  toward any deductible and co-payment obligation under Buyer\'s
Welfare Plans  for such expenses incurred under Seller\'s corresponding plans
during the  plan year in which Transferring Bargaining Unit Employees become
eligible  to participate in Buyer\'s Welfare Plans.   (iii) (A) The parties
shall take any and all necessary and advisable  actions in order to cause
sponsorship of the Pension Plan and its related  trust (or other funding
vehicle) to be transferred, effective as of the  Closing Date, from Seller to
Buyer, provided, that the applicable union  agrees to the continued
application of the Collective Bargaining Agreement  pursuant to which the
Pension Plan is maintained under its terms after the  Closing Date.   (B)
As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall  designate an
independent certified actuary ("Buyer\'s Actuary") to make a 
---------------  calculation of the "accumulated benefit obligation" (the
"ABO") of the  ---  Pension Plan as of June 30, 2001 (the "Valuation Date")
using the actuarial  --------------  methods and assumptions (including
interest and discount rates) adopted by  Seller for fiscal years beginning on
January 1, 2001. Buyer shall deliver  to Seller within thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date (or as soon as  practicable thereafter), a schedule of such
calculations with respect to  the Pension Plan. Seller shall have right to
appoint an independent  certified actuary ("Seller\'s Actuary") who shall
review the ABO calculated  ----------------  by Buyer\'s Actuary in this
paragraph (B) and the methods and assumptions  used in calculating such
amount. Such amount and such methods and  assumptions as certified by
Buyer\'s Actuary shall be final, conclusive and  binding on Seller and Buyer
unless, within 60 days after the delivery of  such certification by Buyer\'s
Actuary to Seller\'s Actuary, together with  such supporting information as
Seller\'s Actuary may reasonably request,  Seller\'s Actuary shall notify
Buyer\'s Actuary of its disagreement with such  amount or methods and
assumptions. If any such disagreement is not resolved  to the satisfaction of
Seller and Buyer within sixty (60) days of Buyer\'s  receipt of such
notification (or within such longer period as Buyer and  Seller shall
mutually agree), either Seller or Buyer may elect to have the  calculations
submitted for resolution to a third independent actuary  appointed mutually
by Seller and Buyer, whose determination shall be made  within sixty (60)
days and shall be conclusive, final and binding. Each  party shall bear the
expenses of its own actuary and the expenses of the  third actuary, if any,
shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.   (C) To the extent that the
ABO of the Pension Plan as  determined hereunder exceeds the fair market
value of the assets of the  Pension Plan as of the Closing Date, Seller
shall, within thirty (30) days  after notice thereof from Buyer contribute to
the Pension Plan the excess  of the ABO of the Pension Plan over such fair
market value, together with  interest on such amount at a rate of interest
per annum equal to the prime  rate in effect on the Closing Date as reported
in The Wall Street Journal  -----------------------  for the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date of such 
contribution.   -55-    (d) Retirement Plan Matters. 
-----------------------   (i) Seller shall cause the trustee of the
Goodman/Amana 401K Plan  (the "Goodman 401K Plan") and the Amana Company,
L.P. 401K Plan for  -----------------  Specified Hourly Employees, (the
"Amana 401K Plan") (as applicable) to  ---------------  transfer the account
balances (vested and unvested) of each Transferring  Employee and
Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee with an account balance  under the
Goodman 401K Plan and the Amana 401K Plan (as applicable) from  the Goodman
401K Plan or the Amana 401K Plan (as applicable) to one or more  new or
existing defined contribution plans maintained or established by  Buyer (the
"Buyer\'s Savings Plan") as follows. As soon as practicable after 
--------------------  the Closing Date, but no later than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the  Closing Date, Seller shall cause the account of each
Transferring Employee  and Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee to be valued
pursuant to the  terms of the Goodman 401K Plan and the Amana 401K Plan (as
applicable). As  of such valuation date, assets equal in value to the amount
credited each  such Transferring Employee\'s and Transferring Bargaining Unit
Employee\'s  account under the Goodman 401K Plan and the Amana 401K Plan (as
applicable)  shall be transferred to the trust maintained under Buyer\'s
Savings Plan.  Such transferred assets shall be in cash (except shall also
include any  promissory notes evidencing outstanding loan balances of the
Transferring  Employees and Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee), and shall
be in  accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code. Prior to, and as a
condition  of, any transfer of assets each party shall provide the other
with  satisfactory evidence that its plan is qualified under Section 401(a)
of  the Code. The liability for contributions to the above-described plans
on  behalf of the Transferring Employees and Transferring Bargaining Unit 
Employees with respect to their contributions to or compensation under such 
plans through the Closing Date shall be accrued on the Closing Date Pro 
Forma Balance Sheet. As of the transfer date, Buyer\'s Savings Plan will be 
liable for the payment of benefits accrued by and transferred in respect of 
the Transferring Employees and Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee from 
the Goodman 401K Plan and the Amana 401K Plan; provided, however, that 
-------- -------  neither Buyer nor Buyer\'s Savings Plan assumes any
liability for the  valuation of the accounts of the Transferring Employees
and Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employee under the Goodman 401K Plan or the
Amana 401K  Plan.   (ii) On or before December 31, 2001, Seller shall file
and Global  shall cause to have filed with the Internal Revenue Service a
request for a  determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that  the Amana 401K Plan and the Goodman 401K Plan are each a
qualified plan  within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code and their
related trusts  are exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Code.
Seller shall  take and Global shall cause to have taken such further actions,
including  the execution of such further instruments and amendments, as
required by  the Internal Revenue Service in order to obtain such
determination letter.   (e) Flexible Spending Accounts. Buyer shall
establish flexible spending  -------------------------- accounts for medical
and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or
maintained under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code ("Buyer\'s FSA"),
effective as of the Closing Date, for each Transferring 
----------- Employee and Transferring Bargaining Unit Employee who, on or
prior to the Closing Date, is a participant, and maintains a positive account
balance, in a flexible   -56-    spending account for medical or
dependent care expenses under a plan  maintained by Seller pursuant to
Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code  ("Seller\'s FSA"). Buyer shall
credit, effective as of the Closing Date, the  ------------  applicable
account of each such Transferring Employee and Transferring  Bargaining Unit
Employee under the Buyer FSA with an amount equal to the  balance of each
such Transferring Employee\'s and Transferring Bargaining  Unit Employee\'s
account under the Seller\'s FSA on the date immediately  prior to the Closing
Date; provided, however, that the aggregate amount  credited by Buyer under
the Buyer\'s FSA to all such Transferring Employees  and Transferring
Bargaining Unit Employees pursuant to this sentence is  accrued on the
Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet. Buyer and Seller  intend that the
actions to be taken pursuant to this subsection (e) be  treated as an
assumption by Buyer of that portion of the Seller\'s FSA and  the elections
made thereunder attributable to Transferring Employees and  Transferring
Bargaining Unit Employees.   (f) Cooperation. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate and provide such  -----------  information as may reasonably be
necessary with respect to each of the  actions contemplated in this Section
5.13, including the procurement of any  ------------  required government
approvals. Seller and Buyer shall also cooperate to  provide a means of
continuing the repayment of outstanding loans of  Transferring Employees from
the Goodman 401K Plan for the period of time  commencing after the Closing
Date and ending on the date of the transfer of  assets described in Section
5.13(d).  ---------------   (g) Obligations. It is intended by the parties
that the  -----------  responsibilities, liabilities, and covenants assumed
or agreed to by Buyer  pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall also bind any
Affiliate of Buyer to  ------------  which all or any portion of the
Business is transferred, and Buyer agrees  to cause any such Affiliate to
observe the provisions and covenants of this  Section 5.13. 
------------   (h) Reporting Requirements. Seller and Buyer hereby agree to
utilize  ----------------------  the "Alternate Procedure" set forth in
Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B.  399, or a corresponding future revenue
procedure or other administrative  pronouncement, with regard to the
reporting requirements attributable to  wages paid or to be paid to
Transferring Employees and Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employees.   (i)
Interim Welfare Coverage. Seller, Global and Buyer acknowledge 
------------------------  that Seller and Global will offer Transferring
Employees and Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employees extended health
coverage under Seller\'s or  Global\'s health plans as required by COBRA.
Seller shall also use its best  efforts in cooperating with Buyer in causing
the insurance carriers and  third party administrators of Seller\'s
accidental death and dismemberment  and life insurance plans to provide
Transferring Employees and Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employees extended
coverage under Seller\'s accidental death  and dismemberment and life
insurance plans until such time as Buyer\'s  accidental death and
dismemberment and life insurance plans are effective.  Buyer agrees that
Buyer\'s health, accidental death and dismemberment and  life insurance plans
covering Transferring Employees and Transferring  Bargaining Unit Employees
will be effective no later than one hundred  twenty (120) days following the
Closing Date and that it will indemnify and  hold Seller, Global and their
respective health, accidental death and  dismemberment and life insurance
plans harmless from any liability for  expenses which would have been covered
by Buyer\'s health, accidental death  and dismemberment and life insurance
plans had they been implemented as of  the Closing Date. The amount of
indemnifiable health, accidental death and  dismemberment and life insurance
expenses will equal the sum of (i) the   -57-   amount actually paid by
Seller\'s or Global\'s plans (as applicable) between the Closing Date and the
effective date of the applicable Buyer plan, less (ii) any contributions
actually paid by Buyer (or the Transferring Employees and the Transferring
Bargaining Unit Employees) after the Closing Date, provided that Seller shall
not refund any such contributions if the amount in clause (ii) exceeds the
amount in clause (i). Seller and Global agree that, if requested by Buyer,
Seller and Global shall use their best efforts to assist Buyer during such
120-day period in the transition from Seller to Buyer of providing
health, accidental death and dismemberment and life insurance coverage to
Transferring Employees and Transferring Bargaining Unit Employees for the
period extending beyond such 120-day period.   (j) No Third Party Rights.
No Transferring Employee or Transferring  --------------------- Bargaining
Unit Employee or other Former Employee or Employee of Seller including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person not a party to this
Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim hereunder.   (k) Costs.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.13, where this  -----
------------ Section 5.13 requires a party to take any action or perform any
task, the party ------------ obligated to take such action or perform such
task shall be responsible for all fees, costs and other expenses incurred
for, and related to, such actions or tasks.   Section 5.14 Right to
Update.  ---------------   From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller
shall have the right (but not any obligation) to update or amend in any
respect its disclosure of any matter set forth or permitted to be set forth
in the Disclosure Schedule. No such update or amendment shall be considered
or given effect for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article VI or the  ---------- right to terminate and
the effect of termination in Article VIII but, if the 
------------ transactions contemplated hereunder are consummated, the
Disclosure Schedule (as so updated or amended) shall be used for purposes of
determining whether the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under Section  ------- 7.2(a)(ii). ----------   Section
5.15 Tax Matters.  -----------   (a) Except as provided in Section 2.9 and
Section 5.15(f), Seller shall  ----------- --------------- be liable for and
pay, and pursuant to Article VII, Seller Group shall indemnify 
----------- and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Party against all Taxes
(including any amounts owed by a Buyer Indemnified Party relating to Taxes
pursuant to a contract or otherwise) applicable to the Business, the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, in each case attributable to
taxable years or periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Overlap Period, the portion of such Overlap Period ending on
and including the Closing Date. Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and
pursuant to Article VII shall indemnify  ----------- and hold harmless each
Seller Indemnified Party against, all Taxes applicable to the Business, the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities that are attributable to taxable
years or periods beginning after the Closing Date and, with respect to any
Overlap Period, the portion of such Overlap Period beginning after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be liable for or 
-------- ------- pay, and shall not indemnify and hold harmless any Seller
Indemnified Party against any Taxes for which Seller is liable under this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5.15, but except as otherwise
provided in Section 5.15(e) and  ------------
--------------- Section -------   -58-    5.15(f), any Overlap Period
shall be treated on a "closing of the books"  -------  basis as two partial
periods, one ending at the close of the Closing Date  and the other beginning
on the day after the Closing Date, except that  Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.     (b) Seller or Buyer, as the
case may be, shall provide reimbursement  for any Tax paid by one party all
or a portion of which is the  responsibility of the other party in accordance
with the terms of this  Section 5.15 without regard to the aggregate
indemnification limitations  ------------  set forth in Section 7.2(f).
Within a reasonable time prior to the payment  --------------  of any such
Tax, the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other  party of the
Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each  party, although
failure to do so will not relieve the other party from its  liability
hereunder.   (c) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article
VII,  -----------  shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from and  against (i) all Taxes imposed on AFSI pursuant to Treas.
Reg. (S) 1.1502-6  or similar provisions of state, local or foreign law, (ii)
all Taxes  imposed on AFSI, or for which AFSI may otherwise be liable, for
any taxable  year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with
respect to  any Overlap Period, that portion of such Overlap Period that ends
on and  includes the Closing Date.   (d) Buyer shall be liable for and pay,
and pursuant to Article VII  -----------  shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller Indemnified Parties from and  against, all Taxes imposed on AFSI for
any taxable year or period that  begins after the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Overlap Period, that  portion of such Overlap Period that
begins after the Closing Date.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 5.15(c) and  ---------------  Section 5.15(d), Seller
Group and Buyer shall be liable for and, pursuant  ---------------  to
Article VII, shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified Parties 
-----------  and Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, for any Taxes that
arise from  and relate solely to AFSI\'s distributive share of Amana
Finance\'s taxable  income for the Overlap Period. For purposes of this
Section 5.15(e), AFSI\'s  ---------------  distributive share of Amana
Finance\'s taxable income for the Overlap Period  shall be prorated between
Seller and Buyer on a daily basis except to the  extent such distributive
share relates to transactions or events occurring  outside the ordinary
course of Amana Finance\'s operations ("Extraordinary  ------------- 
Distributive Item"), in which case such Extraordinary Distributive Item(s) 
-----------------  shall be treated as being allocated to AFSI on the day(s)
the related  transaction or event occurs, and then allocated to either Seller
or Buyer,  as the case may be, on a "closing of the books basis" pursuant to
Section  -------  5.15(a).  -------   (f) Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Closing Date  Pro Forma Balance Sheet shall include an
accrual (as a current liability)  for, and Seller shall have no further
liability for, (x) employment Taxes  attributable to that portion of any
Overlap Period (prorated on a daily  basis) ending on the Closing Date, and
(y) any unpaid real and personal  property Taxes attributable to any taxable
period that begins before but  Taxes with respect to which are not payable
until after the Closing Date  (prorated, in the case of Overlap Periods, on a
daily basis); provided,  --------  however, that such real and personal
property taxes for any such taxable  -------  period, to the extent not
known as of the Closing Date, shall be deemed  (and, for purposes of
successive taxable periods for which this Section  -------  5.15(f) relates,
shall be treated as if such Taxes are known as of the  -------  Closing
Date) to equal 105 percent of the amount of Seller\'s real property  or
personal property Taxes, as the case may be, for the most recent taxable 
period for which real and   -59-    personal property Taxes are known as
of the Closing Date, and that such  deemed real or personal property Taxes
for such taxable period shall be  reasonably adjusted for any acquisitions or
dispositions of property  occurring after the close of the most recently
applicable taxable period.   (g) Prior to the Closing, Seller will: (i) file
or cause to be filed  all Tax returns required by governmental agencies due
on or before the  Closing Date (or timely obtain extensions with respect
thereto), and (ii)  fully pay or cause to be paid in a timely manner all
Taxes required to be  paid by it, except such Taxes as are being contested in
good faith and are  reflected in the Disclosure Schedule, upon or against the
Purchased Assets  so that no lien for Taxes (other than liens assumed by
Buyer hereunder)  shall attach to the Purchased Assets.   (h) After the
Closing Date, and upon reasonable written request of  the other party, Seller
and Buyer will provide each other with such  cooperation and information as
such parties reasonably may request in  filing any Tax return, amended Tax
return or claim for refund, determining  a liability for Taxes or a right to
a refund of Taxes or participating in  or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such  cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax  returns or portions thereof,
together with accompanying schedules and  related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other  determinations by taxing authorities, but in no
event shall the parties be  required to disclose to each other any
information relating to their  business operations other than the operation
of the Business prior to the  Closing Date. Each party shall make its
employees available on a mutually  convenient basis to provide explanations
of any documents or information  provided hereunder. Any information provided
or obtained under this Section  -------  5.15 shall be kept confidential,
except as may otherwise be necessary in  ----  connection with the filing of
returns or claims for refund or in conducting  an audit or other Tax
proceeding. In the event of any contest with a taxing  authority regarding
property Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets for any  tax or assessment
period which is subject to proration under Section 2.9,  -----------  Buyer
shall have the right to control the contest and reasonable out-of-  pocket
expenses with respect to such contest shall be borne by Buyer.   (i) Each
party shall provide the other with the requisite information  reasonably
requested by the other party to allow the preparation of any  federal,
foreign, state and local income tax returns for the period prior  to and
including the Closing Date. Such information shall be provided, in  the tax
information reporting format customarily used by Seller, on or  before sixty
(60) days, to the extent reasonably practicable, after the  Closing Date.  
(j) The parties shall promptly notify each other in writing upon  receipt of
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments  relating to
the Purchased Assets or to any member of Seller\'s or Buyer\'s  Affiliated
Group (as defined in Section 1504 of the Code) in each case for  periods
prior to the Closing or for Overlap Periods.   (k) Buyer shall timely file
all sales and use Tax or other such Tax  returns for any Overlap Period and
for periods ending on or prior to the  Closing Date where the due date for
such returns is a date after the  Closing Date, and Buyer shall pay the Taxes
shown as due on any such  returns. To the extent such returns are filed on
behalf of Seller, all such  returns shall be clearly designated as "Final
Return". Seller shall pay to  the Buyer Seller\'s share of any such Taxes (to
the extent not already paid  by Seller or by the partners of Seller) due
pursuant to the filing of any  such Tax returns under the provisions of this
subsection within thirty (30)  business   -60-   days of receipt of
notice of such filing and payment by Buyer, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the calculations determining Seller\'s share of such Taxes.
However, prior to filing such returns, Buyer will provide Seller the
opportunity to review any Tax returns that it files after the Closing
Date for which Seller is liable for any portion of Tax due on such
returns.   Section 5.16 Agreement Not to Compete.

Global\'s covenant as set forth above, it is understood and agreed that Buyer
shall be entitled to injunctive relief as well as any and all other
applicable remedies at law and in equity available to Buyer. If a court of
competent jurisdiction should declare this covenant unenforceable, in whole

geographical area, then Buyer, Seller and Global hereby acknowledge and agree
that such a court of law or equity shall have the express authority of the
parties to this Agreement to reform this covenant to a reasonable restriction
and/or to grant Buyer any and all other relief, at law or in equity,
reasonably necessary to protect the interests of Buyer. Seller and Global

delivered to Buyer not more than thirty days after the date of this

Each such Title Commitment and Survey shall be updated by Seller to a date

and no later than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date,
and Seller shall cause all such updated Surveys and Title Commitments to

notify ("Title  ----- Objection Notice") Seller of its objection to title
exceptions and/or survey ---------------- matters which: (i) arise after the
execution   -61-    date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date,
(ii) do not  constitute Permitted Exceptions and (iii) adversely affect the
use and  operation of the property (collectively "valid title/survey
objections").  -----------------------------  Upon receipt of any such Title
Objection Notice from Buyer, Seller shall  have the right, but not the
obligation, to cure the valid title/survey  objection(s) and to adjourn the
Closing to a date specified by Seller upon  five (5) days\' notice to Buyer
but not beyond the date which is thirty (30)  days after the then scheduled
Closing Date ("Adjourned Date"), provided,  --------------  Seller shall
have an affirmative obligation to cure any valid title/survey  objection

Seller\'s receipt of a Title Objection Notice, notify Buyer in  writing of
Seller\'s election to cure (and, as applicable, to adjourn the  Closing) or
not to cure such valid title/survey objection(s). If Seller  elects to
adjourn the Closing and cures the valid title/survey objections  on or before
the Adjourned Date, then (subject to satisfaction or waiver of  the
conditions contained in Article VI) the Closing shall occur on such 
----------  Adjourned Date specified by Seller in accordance with the
provisions of  this Agreement without any reduction in or abatement of the
Purchase Price  to Seller. It is acknowledged and agreed that Seller shall be
deemed to  have cured a valid title/survey objection if Seller obtains the
commitment  of the Title Company to insure or endorse over such valid
title/survey  objection and pays all premiums for such insurance or
endorsement over the  valid title/survey objection (to the extent charged by
the Title Company).  If Seller (I) fails to notify Buyer in writing of
Seller\'s election to cure  or not to cure any valid title/survey objection
within the time prescribed  above, (II) fails to cure a valid title/survey
objection which Seller has  elected to cure on or before the later of the
Closing Date and the  Adjourned Date, or (III) elects by notice at any time
not to cure any valid  title/survey objection, then Buyer shall have the
right to either (i) in  the event such valid title/survey objection has a
material and adverse  affect of the use and operation of such property,
terminate this Agreement  by written notice delivered to Seller or (ii)
complete the transactions  contemplated hereby in accordance with this
Agreement without reduction in  or abatement of the Purchase Price to Seller;
provided, however, that this  -------- -------  shall not relieve Buyer of
any of its obligations hereunder. At Closing,  Seller shall cause the Title

the Trademark License Agreement.   Section 5.19 Collection of Receivables. 
-------------------------   (a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall

collection practices presently applied by  the Business in the collection of
its accounts and notes receivable, except  that with respect to any
particular Closing Date Receivable, Buyer shall be  under no obligation to
commence or not to commence litigation to effect  collection and may make any
adjustment, concession or settlement which in  the good faith judgment of
Buyer is commercially reasonable.   -62-   In connection with the
collections by Buyer, if a payment is received from an account debtor who has
not designated the invoice being paid thereby, such payment shall be applied
to the earliest invoice outstanding with respect to indebtedness of such
account debtor, except for those invoices which are subject to a dispute to
the extent of such dispute.   (b) Buyer shall, on or before the tenth
business day of each calendar month commencing with the second complete
calendar month following the Closing Date, deliver to Seller a written report

the Closing Date  Receivables during the period from the Closing Date through
the date of the  Collection Report.   (c) If, after giving effect to all
adjustments, concessions and settlements made and collection fees incurred

within 120 days after the Closing ---------------- Date, an amount equal to
the excess of the Closing Date Receivables over the allowance for doubtful
accounts shown on the Closing Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet (such excess being
referred to herein as the "Net Amount of Receivables"), 
------------------------- then Buyer shall have the right to require Seller
to pay Buyer an amount (the "Uncollected Receivables Amount") equal to (i)
the Net Amount of Receivables  ------------------------------ minus (ii) the
amount collected in cash (after giving effect to the items set ----- forth
above) by Buyer during such 120 day period in respect of the Closing
Date Receivables; provided that Seller shall be required to pay Buyer the
Uncollected  -------- Receivables Amount only to the extent that the
aggregate amount of Buyer Indemnifiable Losses as of the date of payment
exceeds the General Basket Amount; and provided, further, that concurrently
with the payment by Seller of  -------- ------- such amount, Buyer shall
reassign to Seller all such uncollected Closing Date Receivables.   (d) If,
after the Closing Date, Seller shall receive any remittance from any account
debtors with respect to the Closing Date Receivables (excluding any Closing
Date Receivable reassigned to Seller), Seller shall endorse such remittance
to the order of Buyer and forward it to Buyer promptly following receipt
thereof, and any such amounts shall be deemed to have been collected by Buyer
for purposes of this Section 5.19.  ------------   (e) If Buyer shall

to any Closing Date Receivable after such Closing Date Receivable has been
reassigned to Seller, Buyer shall endorse such remittance to the order of
Seller and forward it to Seller promptly following receipt thereof.

Former   -71-    Owner or any of its Affiliates or predecessors and that
is not included in  the Purchased Assets; and   (F) except as provided in
Section 7.2(a)(ii)(E), any Product  ---------------------  Warranty Claims
relating to products of the Business that were manufactured  or purchased by
Seller or its predecessors on or prior to the Closing Date.   (c) Third-
Party Claims. (i) If any claim or demand is asserted against an 
------------------ indemnified party by a third party with respect to any
matter under the indemnities set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) (a "Third
Party Claim"), the  --------------- ------ ----------------- indemnified
party shall promptly give written notice and details thereof (the "Claim
Notice"), including copies of all pleadings and the pertinent documents, 
------------ to the indemnifying party or parties, as the case may be
("Indemnitor").  ----------   (ii) If any Third Party Claim is solely for
money damages or, where  the Seller Group is the Indemnitor, will have no
continuing effect in any  material respect on the Business or the Purchased
Assets, then the  Indemnitor shall have the right, exercisable upon written
notice given  within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, to
conduct and  control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise or  settlement of any such Third Party Claim as to which
indemnification will  be sought by any indemnified party from any Indemnitor
hereunder if the  Indemnitor has acknowledged and agreed in writing that, if
the same is  adversely determined, the Indemnitor has an obligation to
provide  indemnification to the indemnified party in respect thereof, and in
any  such case the indemnifie d party shall cooperate in connection
therewith  and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and
attend such  conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals
as may be  reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith;
provided,  --------  that the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in such  defense at its own expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the indemnified  party shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any such Third  Party Claim, provided that in such event the
indemnified party shall waive  --------  any right to indemnity therefor
hereunder.   (iii) If the Indemnitor does not assume control of the defense
of a  Third Party Claim pursuant to clause (ii) above, then the indemnified
party  shall have the right to pay, compromise or defend any Third Party
Claim and  to assert the amount of any payment on the Third Party Claim plus
the  expense of defense or settlement as an indemnity claim; provided,
however,  -------- -------  that the indemnified party shall not compromise
or settle any such Third  Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitor (which  shall not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnified
party shall also have  the right, exercisable in good faith, to take such
action as may be  necessary to avoid a default prior to the assumption of the
defense of any  Third Party Claim by the Indemnitor and any expenses incurred
by so acting  shall be paid by the Indemnitor; provided that such Third Party
Claim is a  --------  proper claim for indemnification hereunder.   (d)
Payment. Payment of Third Party Claims shall be made in accordance 
------- with Section 7.2(c). With respect to all claims other than Third
Party Claims,  -------------- the Indemnitor shall promptly pay or reimburse
the indemnified party in respect of any claim or liability for Indemnifiable
Damages to which the foregoing indemnities relate after receipt of written
notice   -72-   from the indemnified party outlining with reasonable
particularity the nature and amount of the claim(s). All claims for indemnity
hereunder must be submitted by the indemnified party to the Indemnitor within
the applicable time periods set forth in this Section 7.2. In the event the
Indemnitor fails or refuses to  ----------- make payment for such claims
within a period of twenty (20) days from the date of notice to the
Indemnitor, the indemnified party shall be entitled to exercise all legal
means of relief available.   (e) Access and Information. With respect to any
claim for indemnification  ---------------------- hereunder, the indemnified
party will give to the Indemnitor and its counsel, accountants and other
representatives full and free access, during normal business hours and upon
the giving of reasonable prior notice, to its books and records relating to
such claims, and to its employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, all without charge to the Indemnitor, except
for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. If a claim
for indemnification is made hereunder, the indemnified party agrees to
maintain any of its books and records then in its possession which may relate
to such claim for such period of time as may be necessary to enable the
Indemnitor to resolve such claim.   (f) Monetary Limitations on
Indemnification.  ---------------------------------------   (i) Seller
Group shall not be obligated hereunder to indemnify any  Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages as to  which such persons
are otherwise entitled to indemnification under this  Agreement based on a
breach of a representation or warranty (including  indemnification under
Section 7.3(a)(i) but excluding indemnification based  -----------------  on
Section 3.13) unless and until the aggregate amount of Buyer  ------------ 
Indemnifiable Losses exceeds the General Basket Amount, and thereafter  Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder only  with
respect to any such amounts in excess of the General Basket Amount.   (ii)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the  maximum
aggregate obligation of Seller Group pursuant to Section  ------- 
7.2(a)(ii)(A) and Section 7.2(a)(ii)(E) shall not exceed Fifty Million 
------------- ---------------------  Dollars ($50,000,000.00); provided that
such limitation shall not apply to  --------  the representations set forth
in Section 3.13.  ------------   (iii) The liability of either Seller Group
or Buyer under this  Section 7.2 shall be offset dollar for dollar by any
recovery actually  -----------  made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the  case may be, from any third party
(including insurers) on account of the  item of Indemnifiable Damages
involved (and no right of subrogation shall  accrue to any such third party)
and (ii) shall be net of any Tax benefit  inuring to the indemnified party
therefrom (after giving effect to the Tax  effect (using an assumed Tax rate
of 35% for each of the parties hereto) of  the receipt of the indemnification
payment). The parties hereto agree to  pursue diligently and in good faith
any recovery from any such third party  with respect to any item of
Indemnifiable Damages involved, but payments  for Indemnifiable Damages shall
not be postponed pending any such receipts  or recoveries. Any such receipts
or recoveries received by an indemnified  party after a payment for
Indemnifiable Damages shall be promptly paid over  to the Indemnitor.   (g)
Other Limitations on Indemnification. 
------------------------------------   -73-    (i) IN NO EVENT SHALL
SELLER GROUP BE LIABLE TO THE BUYER INDEMNIFIED  PARTIES FOR PUNITIVE,
SPECIAL EXEMPLARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND IN NO  EVENT SHALL BUYER
GROUP BE LIABLE TO THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR  PUNITIVE, SPECIAL
EXEMPLARY AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, PROVIDED, THAT THESE  LIMITATIONS SHALL
NOT APPLY TO (I) PUNITIVE, SPECIAL EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND  CONSEQUENTIAL
PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR  (II)
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM A SPECIFIC BREACH OF A 
PARTY\'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS HEREUNDER.

may be asserted nor any action commenced against Seller Group for  breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained  herein, unless
written notice of such claim or action is received by  Seller, describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with  respect to the subject
matter of such claim or action on or prior to the  date on which the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which  such claim or
action is based ceases to survive as set forth in this  Agreement
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or  action shall
have occurred before or after such date. Indemnification shall  continue
hereunder with respect to any matter of which a party has notified  the other
parties in accordance with the requirements of this Section 7.2 
-----------  on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise
terminate in  accordance with this Section 7.2(a), as to which the obligation
of such  --------------  other party shall continue until the liability of
such party shall have  been determined pursuant to this Article VII, and the
Indemnitor shall have  reimbursed all indemnified parties for the full amount
of such  Indemnifiable Damages in accordance with this Article VII.

the sole and exclusive indemnities by the --- ----------- Seller Group with
respect to Environmental Matters arising from or related to the Purchased
Assets or the Business.   (a) Seller Group agrees to indemnify, defend and

-74-   7.2(c) shall apply. For all other Environmental Matters covered by
the Seller ------ Group indemnity under Section 7.3(a), Buyer shall have the
right to conduct and  -------------- control, through counsel, consultant or
contractor of its choosing (which shall be reasonably acceptable to Seller)
any Claim of Environmental Liability. Buyer shall provide notice to the
Seller Group of any such Environmental Matter and agrees to reasonably
consult with the Seller Group regarding the scope of any remedial or other
corrective action, and to provide the Seller Group, whenever practicable,
with drafts of proposed submissions to relevant governmental authorities for
comment prior to any final submission. The parties agree that any remedial or
corrective action so controlled by Buyer shall employ measures that are cost
effective and designed to satisfy, rather than exceed, requirements of
applicable Environmental Law as appropriate. Subject to Section 
------- 7.2(f), the Seller Group shall promptly reimburse Buyer for
Indemnifiable ------ Damages incurred pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) upon
submission by Buyer of  -------------- documentation verifying its
costs.   (c) The Seller Group\'s indemnity obligations under Section 7.3(i)
shall  -------------- survive until the sixth (6/th/) anniversary of the

eighth (8/th/) anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that, the 
------------- Seller Group\'s obligation shall continue for any Environmental
Matter for which Buyer has provided notice on or prior to the applicable
anniversary date, until such time that the Seller Group shall have reimbursed
Buyer for the full amount of Indemnifiable Damages for such Environmental
Matter in accordance with this Section 7.3. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the ----------- maximum aggregate obligation of
Seller under Section 7.3(a) shall not exceed  -------------- the amount by
which (i) one-half of the Purchase Price exceeds (ii) the aggregate amount
paid by Seller Group pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(ii)(A). 
---------------------   (d) To the extent any Indemnifiable Damages arising
out of, or in connection with, any Undisclosed Claim of Environmental
Liability or any Environmental Exposure Claim made or asserted during the
Environmental Claims Period, Buyer and Seller Group shall contribute and
share in each item of Indemnifiable Damages as follows:   Period During
Which a Claim  for Indemnification is Made Relative Obligations   Beginning
with the Closing Date Seller Group shall bear ninety  through the day
immediately preceding percent (90%) and Buyer shall  the second anniversary
of the bear ten percent (10%) of each  Closing Date item of Indemnifiable
Damages   Beginning with the second anniversary Seller Group shall bear  of
the Closing Date through the day seventy-five percent (75%) and  immediately
preceding the fifth Buyer shall bear twenty-five  anniversary of the Closing
Date percent (25%) of each item of  Indemnifiable Damages   Beginning with

through the day percent (50%) and Buyer shall   -75-    immediately

party and shall not be subject to change thereafter. Seller Group\'s
indemnification obligations with respect to Undisclosed Claims of
Environmental Liability which involve remediation, rectification or clean-up
of any Environmental Matter shall be limited to those Indemnifiable Damages
which may be reasonably incurred to bring such Environmental Matter into
substantial compliance with the remediation levels or performance standards
imposed under Environmental Laws as in effect at the time the remediation is
commenced.   Section 7.4 Arbitration.  -----------   Except for disputes
resolved under Section 2.6 of this Agreement, all  ----------- controversies
and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof
shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial
Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"),  --- incorporated
herein by reference, by a single neutral arbitrator to be chosen
in accordance with the procedures of the AAA. The arbitration proceeding
shall be conducted in Chicago, Illinois. The parties acknowledge that this
Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the
arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.

supersede, as among the parties hereto, any finding of liability or
apportionment of damages resulting from the judicial resolution of any Third
Party Claim involving Undisclosed Claims of Environmental Liability or
Environmental Exposure Claims. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order
or grant, including the issuance of an injunction. Judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction
thereof. However, any of the parties may, without inconsistency with this
arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction hereof and seek
interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the
arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved.
Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this
arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim
relief, or as may be required by applicable law or regulation, including
applicable securities laws or regulations of an established national
securities exchange on which securities of Buyer or Seller are traded,

results of any arbitration hereunder to any other third party other than its
attorneys and auditors without the prior written consent of both parties.

acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims relating to the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the

either party may  ----------- exercise any and all remedies it may have at
law or in equity in   -76-   the event of a breach by the other party of

Section 7.4. In furtherance of the  ----------- -----------

Seller Group hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable

or local statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including any such
rights, claims or causes of action arising under or based upon common law or
otherwise) with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing
subsection (a), nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prevent any party
hereto from seeking and obtaining  ----------- specific performance by
another party hereto of any of its obligations under this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.10 or from seeking and obtaining 
------------ injunctive relief against another party\'s activities in breach
of this Agreement.   (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Buyer after the Closing to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 7.6 Adjustment to Purchase Price.  -----------------------------  
Any payment by Buyer or Seller Group under this Article VII shall, to the 
----------- extent such payment can be properly so characterized under

either Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred by the close
of business on September 30, 2001, so long as the failure to consummate
the transaction on or before such date did not result solely from the failure
by the party (or its Affiliate) seeking termination of this Agreement to
fulfill any undertaking or commitment on its part provided for herein prior
to Closing;   (c) by Seller, if neither it nor Global is then in material
breach of this Agreement, provided Buyer is in material breach of this

omitted from any preliminary prospectus if the final prospectus shall correct
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or such omission or
alleged omission, and a copy of the final prospectus has not been sent or
given to such person at or prior to the confirmation of sale to such person
if such underwriter was under an obligation to deliver such final prospectus
and failed to do so. Buyer shall also indemnify underwriters, selling
brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating in the distribution, their officers, directors, agents and
employees and each person who controls such persons (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20   of the Exchange Act) to
the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
Shareholders.   2. Each Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,
each of its directors, each of its officers who shall have signed the
registration statement, each person or entity, if any, who controls Buyer
within the meaning of the Securities Act, any other Shareholder, any
controlling person or entity of any such other Shareholder and each officer,
director, partner, and employee of such other Shareholder and such
controlling person or entity, against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (joint and several), including attorneys\' fees and
disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant
to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to
which any of the foregoing persons or entities may otherwise become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state laws,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out
of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to
the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished by such Shareholder expressly for use in
connection with such registration or any information provided by such
Shareholder regarding its proposed plan of distribution; provided, however,
that (x) the indemnification required by this  -------- ------- Section 2
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
claim, --------- damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected
without the consent of the relevant Shareholder, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and (y) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity
under this Section 2 exceed  --------- the gross proceeds from the
applicable offering received by such Shareholder.   3. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnified party under this Exhibit B of  --------- notice of
the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat
thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a
claim under this Exhibit B, such indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying  --------- party a written notice of the commencement thereof
and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to
the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its -------- ------- own
counsel, with the fees and disbursements and expenses to be paid by
the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the
counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and
any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure
to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time
following the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability
to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability
to the indemnified party under this Exhibit B but shall not relieve the
indemnifying  --------- party of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than pursuant to this Exhibit B. Any fees and
expenses incurred by the indemnified  --------- party (including any fees
and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend
such action or proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as
incurred, within thirty (30) days of written notice thereof to the
indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an
indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). Any such
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expenses of such
indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such
fees and expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed
to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim   or proceeding or
(iii) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and
the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which
are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying
party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a conflict of
interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party could not
faithfully represent the indemnified party (in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects
to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection
with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially
similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
(together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such
indemnified parties, unless in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified
party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any
other of such indemnified parties with respect to such action, claim or
proceeding, in which event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels).
No indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party for any
settlement of any action, proceeding or claim without the written consent of
the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
4. If the indemnification required by this Exhibit B from the 
--------- indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder
in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred
to in this Exhibit B: ---------   A. The indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified  party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified  party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses  in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the  indemnifying party and indemnified parties
in connection with the actions  which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses, as  well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of  such indemnifying party and
indemnified parties shall be determined by  reference to, among other things,
whether any Violation has been committed  by, or relates to information
supplied by, such indemnifying party or  indemnified parties, and the
parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to  information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such Violation. The  amount paid or payable by a party
as a result of the losses, claims,  damages, liabilities and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to  include, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 1 and Section 2,  --------- ---------  any legal or other
fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in  connection with any
investigation or proceeding.   B. The parties hereto agree that it would not
be just and equitable  if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were
determined by pro rata  ---------  allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take into  account the equitable considerations
referred to in Section 4(A). No person  ------------  or entity guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of  Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from  any person or entity
who was not guilty of such fraudulent  misrepresentation.    5. If
indemnification is available under this Exhibit B, the indemnifying 
--------- parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent
provided in this Exhibit B without regard to the relative fault of such
indemnifying party  --------- or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration referred to in Section  ------- 4. -   6. The obligations
of Buyer and the Shareholders under this Exhibit B  --------- shall survive
the completion of any offering of Maytag Shares pursuant to a Registration
Statement under this Agreement, and otherwise.   '
