this Agreement.

_ARTICLE IV_

TITLE MATTERS

4.1 _Defensible Title_.

(a) _Defensible Title  Definitions_. The term " _Defensible Title_ " means,
as to each Well or Well Location described on  _Exhibit B_ , such title held
by Seller that: (i) for each such Well or Well Location, entitles Seller (and
after Closing will entitle Buyer) to receive not less than the net revenue
interest (the " _NRI_ ") set forth in  _Exhibit B_ for such Well or Well
Location, without reduction, suspension or termination (except as set forth in
_Exhibit B_ ); (ii) obligates Seller (and after Closing will obligate Buyer)
to bear costs and expenses relating to the  



 

13  maintenance, development, operation and the production of Hydrocarbons from
the Well or Well Location in an amount not greater than the corresponding
working interest (the " _WI_ ") set forth in _Exhibit B_ without a
corresponding increase in the NRI (except as set forth in _Exhibit B_ ); (iii)
is reflected by appropriate documentation properly filed in the
official records of Mesa County or Garfield County, Colorado, and of the
United States Bureau of Land Management, as applicable; (iv) is not adversely
affected by any failure of Seller or others to have obtained any Permit or
other regulatory action from any Governmental Authority necessary or
desirable for the ownership or operation thereof in accordance with historical
practice or that are necessary to carry out the drilling of the Well Locations
described in _Schedule 8.1(a)(ii)_ ; and (v) subject to and except for the
Permitted Encumbrances, is free and clear of liens, security interests, title
defects and encumbrances of any kind or character. The term "Defensible Title"
means, as to each Other Asset, such title held by Seller that: (i) is good
and marketable, subject to and except only for the Permitted Encumbrances; and
(ii) is not adversely affected by any failure of Seller or others to have
obtained any Permit or other regulatory action from any Governmental
Authority necessary or desirable for the ownership or operation thereof in
accordance with historical practice or that are necessary to carry out the
drilling of the Well Locations described in _Schedule 8.1(a)(ii)_. 

(b) _Allocated Value_. If a Well, Well Location or any Other Asset has not
been given an Allocated Value by Buyer, or if the Allocated Value (prior to
any adjustments hereunder) of such Well, Well Location or Other Asset is
$20,000 or less, Seller shall be deemed to have Defensible Title to such Well,
Well Location or Other Asset.

4.2 _Purchase Price Adjustments for Defective Interests_.

(a) _Defective Interest_. " _Defective Interest_ " means a Well, Well Location
or Other Asset affected by a Title Defect that reduces the Allocated Value of
the affected Well, Well Location or Other Asset by more than $20,000 (the "
_Individual Title Defect Threshold_ "). For purposes hereof, a " _Title
Defect_ " means any lien, encumbrance, adverse claim, encroachment,
irregularity, defect in or objection to title, excluding Permitted
Encumbrances, that alone or in combination with other defects renders Sellers
title to a Well, Well Location or Other Asset less than Defensible Title.

(b) _Notice of Defective Interest_. Buyer shall give Seller written notice (a
" _Notice of Defective Interest_ ") as soon as Title Defects are discovered,
and in any event no later than the Closing Date (the " _Notice Deadline_ "). A
Notice of Defective Interest shall include all of the following: (i)
a description of each Defective Interest; (ii) the basis for each Defective
Interest, and, if the basis is derived from any document, a copy of such
document (or pertinent part thereof) shall be attached, or if the basis is
derived from any gap in the chain of title, the documents preceding and
following the gap shall be attached; (iii) the Allocated Value of such
affected Well, Well Location or Other Asset; and (iv) Buyers good faith
estimate of the Defect Value and the computations upon which Buyers estimate
is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title
Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before
the end of each calendar week prior to the Notice Deadline, a Notice of
Defective Interest covering all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Notice Deadline.



 

14 (c) _Defect Adjustments_.

(i) Subject to _Sections 4.2(a)_ and _(b)_ , if a Well, Well Location or Other
Asset is a Defective Interest, the Purchase Price will be reduced under
_Section 2.7(b)(iv)_ by the corresponding Defect Value (which reduction is
called a " _Defect Adjustment_ ") unless (A) the basis for treating such Well,
Well Location or Other Asset as a Defective Interest has been removed by
Seller at its sole cost and expense to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer
prior to Closing, (B) Buyer agrees to waive the relevant Title Defect, (C)
Seller elects not later than two business days prior to Closing to cure such
Title Defect no later than 90 days after Closing, or (D) Seller elects to
retain the entirety of the Well, Well Location or Other Asset that is subject
to such Title Defect and treat it as an Excluded Asset, in which case the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Well, Well Location or Other Asset. Any Purchase Price reduction under
clause (D) shall also constitute a Defect Adjustment for purposes of this
Agreement. If Seller and Buyer elect not to pursue any of the options in
clauses (A), (B), or (C) in the previous sentence with respect to any
Defective Interests, the Purchase Price shall be reduced pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)(iv)_.

(ii) In order to provide security for Title Defects to be cured after Closing,
for Environmental Defects resolved under _Section 5.5_, and for indemnity
claims under _Section 14.1_, at Closing (i) the Shares and (ii) $12,500,000
of the Purchase Price shall be deposited by Buyer into the Escrow Account (in
case of the Shares, by delivery of the certificate representing the Shares
accompanied by a properly completed undated stock power, duly executed in
blank by the record holder and in the case of the amount specified in clause
(ii), by wire transfer).

(A) If any Title Defect that Seller has elected to cure is cured to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer on or before 90 days after Closing, Buyer
shall so notify Seller within 15 days after receipt of such curative
materials. Within five days after Buyer has notified Seller that such Title
Defect has been cured to its reasonable satisfaction, the parties shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Seller out of the Escrow Account
the Defect Value for such Title Defect. If Buyer disputes the adequacy of
Sellers curative material with respect to, or that Seller has adequately
cured, any Title Defect, Buyer shall so notify Seller within 15 days after
receipt of such curative materials.

(B) If Seller provides no curative materials to cure a Title Defect within
the 90-day time period, subject to Sellers rights under _Section
4.2(c)(ii)(C)_ below, Buyer may elect to treat the affected Wells, Well
Locations or Other Assets as Excluded Assets, in which case Buyer will cause
the Excluded Asset to be assigned to Seller or Sellers designee effective as
of the Effective Time free of all liens, encumbrances and defects arising by,
through or under Buyer. Upon such election by Buyer, Buyer shall have the
option to either (1) receive the Allocated Value of the Excluded Asset as a
credit to Buyer in the Final Settlement Statement prepared pursuant to
_Section 13.1_, or (2) have the parties instruct the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Buyer, promptly after Buyers election to treat the affected
Property as an Excluded Asset, the Defect Value with respect to such Title
Defect.

(C) If Buyer disputes the adequacy of Sellers curative materials or that a
Title Defect has been cured by Seller, or if Seller disputes the Defect Value
 



 

15  asserted by Buyer for a Title Defect covered by _Section 4.2(c)(ii)(B)_,
the issue of the adequacy of the curative materials, the fact of the cure or
the amount of the Defect Value will be deemed submitted for resolution under
_Section 4.4_. The actual Defect Value for the Title Defect as determined
under _Section 4.4_ shall be distributed to Buyer on the Final
Settlement Date (or later determination of the Defect Value).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.2_, (A) in
no event shall there be any Defect Adjustment or other remedies provided by
Seller for any Title Defect for which the Defect Value does not exceed the
Individual Title Defect Threshold, and (B) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller
for any Defective Interest, unless the sum of the Defect Adjustments for all
Defective Interests and Environmental Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any
Title Defects cured by Seller, exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the
Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Defect Deductible_ "), after which point
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price only with respect
to aggregate Defect Adjustments and Environmental Defects in excess of the
Aggregate Defect Deductible.

(d) _Defect Value_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Defective
Interest has been reduced by a Title Defect (the " _Defect Value_ ") shall be
determined in accordance with this _Section 4.2(d)_. In determining which
portion of a Property is a Defective Interest pursuant to this _Section
4.2(d)_, it is the intent of the parties to include, to the extent possible,
only that portion of the Property adversely affected by the defect as a
Defective Interest. The Defect Value may not exceed the Allocated Value of
the Property, and shall be determined by the parties in good faith taking into
account all relevant factors, including, without limitation, the following:

(i) the Allocated Value of the affected Property;

(ii) in the case of Wells or Well Locations, the potential for, or actual
reduction in, the NRI of the Defective Interest, or the potential for, or
actual increase in, the WI to the extent such increase is not accompanied by a
corresponding increase in the NRI of the Defective Interest;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents only a possibility of title failure, the
probability that such failure will occur;

(iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; and

(v) if the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the Property, the cost of
removing such lien or encumbrance.

(e) _Waiver_. Subject to Sellers special warranty of title to be contained in
the Assignment and Bill of Sale referred to in  _Section 12.3(a)_, Buyer
shall be deemed to have conclusively waived all Title Defects (i) that do not
qualify as Defective Interests, or (ii) that are not disclosed to Seller in a
Notice of Defective Interests prior to the Notice Deadline. Any Title Defect
waived shall be deemed a Permitted Encumbrance.



 

16 4.3 _Interest Additions_.

Promptly on discovery and in any event no later than the Notice Deadline,
Seller may notify Buyer in writing of any interest that entitles a Seller
to receive more than the NRI set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto with respect to
a Well or Well Location listed thereon, to the extent the same does not cause
a greater than proportionate increase in Sellers WI therein above that shown
on  _Exhibit B_ , or obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses in an amount
less than the WI set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto, to the extent the same
causes a decrease in Sellers WI that is proportionately greater than the
decrease in Sellers NRI therein below that shown on _Exhibit B_
(collectively, " _Interest Additions_ "). Any notice of possible Interest
Additions must include (a) a description of each Interest Addition, (b) the
basis for each Interest Addition, (c) the Allocated Value of the Well or Well
Location affected by the Interest Addition, and (d) the value of the Interest
Addition or the amount by which Seller believes the Allocated Value of the
Well or Well Location has been increased by the Interest Addition (" _Value
of Interest Addition_ ") and the computations upon which Sellers belief is
based. The Value of the Interest Addition shall be determined by the parties
in good faith taking into account all relevant factors including those set
forth in _Section 4.2(d)_, and the Purchase Price will be increased in
accordance with _Section 2.7(a)(vi)_ by the amount by which the aggregate of
all Value of Interest Additions exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of
the Purchase Price (an " _Interest Addition Adjustment_ "). If Buyer disputes
the existence of an Interest Addition or the Value of an Interest Addition,
the issue will be deemed submitted for resolution under _Section 4.4_.
Seller shall be deemed to have conclusively waived all Interest Addition
Adjustments that are not disclosed to Buyer in writing by the Notice Deadline.

4.4 _Title Dispute Resolution_.

(a) The parties agree to resolve disputes concerning the following matters
pursuant to this _Section 4.4_: (i) the existence and scope of a Title
Defect, (ii) the Defect Value of that portion of the Properties affected by a
Title Defect, (iii) the adequacy of Sellers Title Defect curative materials
submitted pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_ or of the cure of a Title Defect, and
(iv) the existence or Value of an Interest Addition (collectively, the "
_Disputed Title Matters_ ").

(b) The parties agree to attempt to initially resolve all Disputed Title
Matters through good faith negotiations. If the parties cannot resolve any
such Disputed Title Matters on or before the Closing, then the Disputed Title
Matters will be finally determined by an independent arbitrator mutually
acceptable to the parties, who shall be a title attorney with at least 10
years experience in Colorado oil and gas titles or, if no such arbitrator is
mutually acceptable and selected by the parties within 10 days after Closing,
then as selected by the American Arbitration Association (in either event,
the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 4.4_. The Title
Arbitrators determination of the dispute shall be made within 20 days after
submission of the matters in dispute, and shall be final and binding upon
both parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall take into account the factors set forth in _Sections 4.1_
through _4.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Disputed Title Matters
arising with regard to Title Defects that Seller elects to cure after Closing,
the Title Arbitrator shall be selected by the parties not  



 

17  later than 100 days after Closing, and the Title Arbitrators determination
of the dispute shall be made within 20 days after submission of the
matters in dispute. The costs incurred in employing the Title Arbitrator
shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. After the Title Arbitrator
makes a determination as to any Disputed Title Matters, the Title Arbitrator
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller or Buyer the appropriate
funds from the Escrow Account.

4.5 _Casualty Loss and Condemnation_. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to
production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including watering out of
any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well) and the
depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case,
with respect to the Properties.

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Properties is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the Loss as a result of
such individual casualty or taking exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase
Price based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall elect by written notice to
Buyer prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by such
casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior
to such casualty or taking, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) to treat
such casualty or taking as basis for a downward adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ with respect to the affected Asset or
Assets under _Section 4.3_. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to
insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against third parties with
respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the parties otherwise
agree in writing.

(c) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Properties is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the Loss to the Assets
as a result of all such casualties or taking is 10 percent (10%) or less of
the Purchase Price based on the Allocated Value of the affected Properties,
Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at Closing, shall
pay to Buyer (i) all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of such
casualty or taking insofar as with respect to the Properties and shall assign,
transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right,
title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and
other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than
insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of
such casualty or taking insofar as with respect to the Properties and (ii) an
amount equal to any applicable deductible under Sellers insurance policies
covering such Loss; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall reserve and retain
(and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, title, interests and claims
against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses
incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance
claims or other rights against third parties or in defending or asserting

pending or threatened with respect to any Property or portion thereof after
the date of this  



 

18  Agreement, but no taking of such Property or portion thereof occurs prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller,
at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer
to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in such condemnation or
eminent domain action, including any future awards therein, insofar as they
are attributable to the Properties threatened to be taken, except that Seller
shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights,
titles, interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of

_ARTICLE V_

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

5.1  _Assertions of Environmental Defects_.

(a) Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of
this  _Section 5.1_ (collectively the " _Environmental Defect Notices_ " and
individually an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") not later than the Notice
Deadline setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion,
constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as
Environmental Defects pursuant to this _Section 5.1_. For purposes hereof, an
" _Environmental Defect_ " shall mean the existence as of the date of any
such notice with respect to the Assets or the operation thereof of any
environmental pollution, contamination, degradation, damage or injury as to
which remedial or corrective action is presently required (or if known, would
be presently required) under Environmental Laws or which, if left
unremediated, would reasonably be likely to require future Remediation under
Environmental Laws as in effect at the Closing Date.

(b) For all purposes of this Agreement (excluding _Section 14.1(c)_), Buyer
shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any Environmental Defect which
Buyer fails to properly assert as an Environmental Defect by an Environmental
Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Notice Deadline.

(c) Each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect,
(ii) a description of each Well, Well Location or other portion of the Assets
that Buyer believes in good faith is affected by the alleged Environmental
Defect, (iii) Buyers assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of the
Properties or other portion of the Assets affected by the alleged
Environmental Defect, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect, and (v) a
calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that
Buyer asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers
calculation of the Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect
Notice must describe in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the
Environmental Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect
and identify all assumptions used by the Buyer in calculating the Remediation
Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
cure any claimed Environmental Defect on or before Closing.



 

19 5.2 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_.

(a) Subject to Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of an
Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with
respect thereto, in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted
by Buyer in accordance with _Section 5.1_ is not waived in writing by Buyer
or cured by Seller on or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option,
elect to: 

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate Defect
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

(ii) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect;
or

(iii) retain the Well, Well Location or other portion of the Assets that is
subject to such Environmental Defect and treat it as an Excluded Asset,
in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Well, Well Location or other portion of the Assets. If
the portion of the Assets affected by the Environmental Defect is a field
facility that is not located on a Well or Well Location, then for purposes of
this clause (iii), in making the election provided in this clause (iii) with
regard to such Environmental Defect, Seller shall retain all of the Wells or
Well Locations that are or will be served by the affected facility.

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Environmental
Defect and such Environmental Defect and all liabilities with respect thereto
shall be deemed to constitute Assumed Obligations. If Seller elects the option
set forth in clause (ii) above, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of
Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and Buyer shall grant Seller
access to the affected Property after the Closing Date to implement and
complete such Remediation to the extent and as long as necessary to conduct
and complete such Remediation. Seller will be deemed to have adequately
completed the Remediation required in the immediately preceding sentence (A)
upon receipt of a certificate or approval from the applicable Governmental
Authority that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to
comply with existing regulatory requirements or (B) upon receipt of a
certificate from a mutually agreeable licensed professional engineer that the
Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to comply with
existing regulatory requirements.

5.3 _Exclusive Remedy_.

Subject to _Sections 5.4_ and _14.1(c)_ , _Section 5.2_ shall be the
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect.

5.4 _Environmental Deductibles_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, (a) in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any individual  



 

20  Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed
$50,000 per individual Well, Well Location or other portion of the Assets
affected by such Environmental Defect (" _Individual Environmental Threshold_
"); and (b) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect for which
the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless
the sum of (i) the Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold, in the aggregate, excluding any
Environmental Defects cured by Seller, plus (ii) the sum of the Defect
Adjustments for all Defective Interests exceeds the Aggregate Deductible,
after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price
only with respect to aggregate Environmental Defects and Defect Adjustments
in excess of the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

5.5 _Environmental Dispute Resolution_.

Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and
Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree
by Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute
shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an
environmental attorney with at least ten years experience in environmental
matters involving oil and gas producing properties in Colorado, as selected by
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the Closing Date,
and absent such agreement, by the American Arbitration Association (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 5.5_. The Environmental
Arbitrators determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties,
without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 5.5_
and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award the
Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by
Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the
specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted
by either party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either
party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.
To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to
any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price in the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to _Section 13.1_,
then within ten days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount,
and subject to _Article V_ , the Environmental Arbitrator shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay to Seller or Buyer the appropriate funds from the Escrow
Account.



 

21 5.6 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_.

Buyer acknowledges that the Properties have been used for exploration,
development, and production of oil and gas and that there may be
petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located
in, on or under the Properties or associated with the Properties. Equipment
and sites included in the Properties may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials,
and equipment located on the Properties or included in the Properties may
contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing
material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact
with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils
or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media,
wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Properties.

Agreement to the Closing Date, Seller will not:

(i) sell, transfer or abandon any part of the Assets, or voluntarily permit
any of the Assets or any material rights with respect thereto to expire, or

in paying quantities);

(ii) except for activities in connection with the drilling of the Well
Locations described in _Schedule 8.1(a)(ii)_ , which has been approved by

$200,000 per activity net to direct or indirect interest of Seller (except
for emergency operations, operations required under presently existing
contractual obligations and ongoing commitments under existing AFEs as
described in _Schedule 8.1(a)(ii)_ ). All expenditures (from the first
dollar) incurred by Seller for operations consented to by Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ which are anticipated to exceed such $200,000 limit
are herein called " _Approved Expenditures_ " and the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all Approved
Expenditures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any expenditures incurred for
what Seller reasonably deems to be an emergency operation, yet conducted
without Buyers consent, shall be Approved Expenditures;

(iii) enter into any new marketing contracts or agreements providing for the
sale or disposition of Hydrocarbons produced from the Properties for a term in
excess of 30 days;

(iv) modify, amend or terminate any of the Material Contracts or Leases;

(v) encumber any of the Properties, or acquire any additional interests in
any of the Properties other than non-consent interests; or

(vi) convey or dispose of any material part of the Assets (other than
replacement of equipment or sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Assets in
the regular course of business) or enter into any farmout, or enter into any
farmin or other similar contract affecting the Properties.

(b) _Operation in Ordinary Course_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Seller will continue or, with respect to Properties operated by
other Persons, to the extent within Sellers reasonable control cause to be
continued the operation of the Properties in the ordinary course of its
business, in accordance with past practices.



 

31 (c) _Notices of Claims_. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer, if, between the
date of execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller receives
written notice of any claim, suit, action or other proceeding of the type
referred to in _Section 6.6_ or written notice of any default under any
Material Contract.

(d) _Consents of Others_ ; Conditions. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations and consents

covering the Properties and Sellers operations in full force and effect
through the Closing Date.

(f) _Burdens_. Seller shall ensure that all expenses, burdens and obligations

the Closing Date are properly and fully paid prior to the Closing Date.

(g) _Financial Statements_. Seller will deliver (i) upon execution hereof,
consolidated financial statements of Seller for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2006, together with the audit report thereon of Sellers independent
public accountants and (ii) within 40 days after the end of each fiscal
quarter ending prior to the Closing Date, unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Seller, in each case meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the Commission. In the event audited financial statements on
the Properties are required, Seller agrees to have such carve-out audit
prepared by its auditors within 60 days after the Closing Date, at
Buyers expense. Seller will cause its auditors to issue in favor of, or as
requested by, Buyer, any consents, reports, opinions and comfort letters with
respect to such financial statements that would be required by Buyer to issue
and sell securities in one or more public offerings (through underwriters or
otherwise), or otherwise as required by Buyer to comply with its continuous
reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or the requirements of any stock exchange on which Buyers securities are
listed or admitted for trading.

8.2 _Covenants and Agreements of Buyer_. 

Buyer covenants and agrees with Seller that:

(a) _Status_. Buyer shall maintain its entity status from the date hereof
until the Final Settlement Date, and use all reasonable efforts to assure that
as of the Closing Date it will not be under any material corporate, legal or
contractual restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation
of the transaction contemplated hereby.

(b) _Consents of Others; Conditions_. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents and
permits from Third Parties, if any, required of Buyer to permit it to
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



 

32 (c) _Bonds and Other Documents_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds,
letters of credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates
with Governmental Authorities or other Third Parties and relating to the
Assets or the Material Contracts (all of which bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees are described in _Schedule 8.2(c)_ ) are transferable to Buyer. On
or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the
name of Buyer or its designee, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit
and guarantees, to the extent such replacements are necessary to permit the
cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by Seller
and/or its Affiliates. In addition, at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of bonds or other security with all
applicable Governmental Authorities meeting the requirements of such
authorities to own and, where appropriate, operate, the Assets, and meeting
the requirements of Third Parties under the Material Contracts.

8.3 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_.

and Buyer dated March 19, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall be

other party has breached the terms of this Agreement, the party who believes
the breach has occurred may give written notice to the breaching party of the
nature of the breach and give that party five business days to cure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall not apply to
breach of the parties obligations at Closing and shall not operate to delay
Closing unless the non-breaching party agrees to extend the Closing to allow
the other party to cure.

(c) _Like-Kind Exchange_. Each party consents to the other partys assignment
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to its Qualified
Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the
Treasury Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service), or to
its Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined
in Rev. Proc. 2000-37), in connection with effectuation of a like-kind
exchange. However, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment
of this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary or to a Qualified Exchange
Accommodation Titleholder does not release either party from any of its
liabilities and obligations under this Agreement. If requested to do so, each
party agrees to cooperate with the other to attempt structure the transaction
as a like-kind exchange; _provided, however_ , that neither party shall be
required to assume any additional liabilities or obligations in connection
with such like-kind exchange.

8.4 _Personnel_.

Attached hereto as _Schedule 8.4_ is a list of employees who are directly
engaged in the operation, maintenance, administration and similar functions
for the Properties and who may be available for employment after Closing.
Buyer will evaluate its personnel needs and consider offering employment to
these certain employees on a case-by-case basis; however, the Buyer  



 

33  will have no obligation to hire any such employees. Any offers of employment
made by Buyer will be effective as of the Closing Date. Buyer will not
have access to personnel records relating to individual performance or other
working history, unless the applicable employee provides Seller with a signed
release permitting the disclosure of said information.

8.5 _HSR Act_.

Within five business days following the execution by Buyer and Seller of this
Agreement, Buyer and Seller will each prepare and simultaneously file with the
DOJ and the FTC the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the HSR Act, and request early termination
of the waiting period thereunder. The fees required for such filings shall be
the responsibility of Buyer. Buyer and Seller agree to respond promptly to any
inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in
all material respects with the filing requirements of the HSR Act. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall promptly furnish all information to the
other party that is necessary in connection with Buyers and Sellers
compliance with the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall keep each other fully
advised with respect to any requests from or communications with the DOJ
or FTC concerning such filings and shall consult with each other with respect
to all responses thereto. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its reasonable
efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection
with any HSR Act filing to consummate the transactions consummated hereby.

_ARTICLE IX_

TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Apportionment of Tax Liability_. 

All Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Time
for all taxable periods that include the Effective Time. Based on the best
current information available as of Closing, the proration shall be made
between the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.7(b)(iii)_, and shall be subject to adjustment in the
Final Settlement Statement based on then-current information, which shall
then constitute a final settlement of Taxes between the parties. Taxes based
on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons or the value thereof shall be
deemed attributable to the period when such Taxes are assessed (even if the
same are based on production or other activities occurring in prior periods).
Accordingly, after Closing, and subject to adjustment in the Final Settlement
Statement, Buyer expressly assumes its proportionate share of all obligations
and liabilities for all Taxes payable by Seller that are assessed after the
Effective Time, regardless of whether such Taxes are attributable to the
period of time before or after the Effective Time. 

9.2 _Tax Returns and Reports_.

For the tax period in which the Effective Time occurs, Seller agrees to
immediately forward to Buyer any tax returns and reports relating to the
Assets received by Seller after Closing and provide Buyer with
any information Seller has in its possession that is necessary for Buyer to
file any required tax returns and reports relating to the Assets. Buyer agrees
to file all  



 

34  tax returns and reports applicable to the Assets and required to be filed
after the Closing, pay all required Taxes payable with respect to the Assets
for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement, and indemnify Seller
against liability for the payment of such Taxes and the filing of such tax
returns or reports. This indemnity shall survive Closing.

showing the calculation of such adjustment, and (ii) the resulting final
purchase price for the  



 

38  Assets equal to the Closing Amount adjusted by the amounts in the foregoing
clause (i) (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). As soon as practicable after
receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, but in no event later than on or
before 30 days after receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes that
Buyer proposes to make to the Final Settlement Statement. Buyers failure to
deliver to Seller a written report detailing proposed changes to the Final
Settlement Statement by that date shall be deemed an acceptance by Buyer of
the Final Settlement Statement as submitted by Seller. The parties shall
agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, no later than 45
days after receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement. The date
upon which such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price
is established shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Settlement Date_."
If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Closing Amount, Buyer shall pay
Seller the amount of such difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less

accounting firm selected by the parties (the " _Accountants_ "). No later than
20 days after initiating the arbitration procedure, the Accountants shall
conduct a hearing, at which time the parties shall present such evidence and
witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal
rules of evidence shall not be required, but the Accountants shall consider
any evidence and testimony that they determine to be relevant, in accordance
with procedures that they determine to be appropriate. The Accountants shall
render their written decision specifically establishing the Final Purchase
Price within 30 days after the hearing, which decision shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer. A decision may be filed in any
court of competent jurisdiction and may be enforced by any party as a final
judgment of such court. Without the consent of Seller and Buyer, the
arbitration shall not determine any issues other than adjustments to be made
pursuant to _Sections 2.7_ and _13.1(a)_ ; all other disputes shall be handled
pursuant to the provisions of _Sections 4.5_ , _5.5_ and _15.16_. The costs of

or affected thereby, originals of the Records (at Sellers option). In the
event that Seller does not retain originals or copies of certain Records,
Seller shall have the right to review and copy the Records during
standard business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains
the Records. Buyer agrees that the Records will be maintained in compliance
with all applicable Laws governing document retention.

13.4 _Suspense Accounts_.

Seller shall transfer to Buyer only those monies held in suspense by Seller at
Closing that relate to royalties and overriding royalties as to which Buyer
shall be responsible for distribution after Closing. In addition to the
information set forth on _Schedule 6.16_ , Seller agrees to provide to Buyer
any information reasonably requested by Buyer regarding all of Sellers
accounts holding monies in suspense that will be transferred to Buyer together
with a written explanation (as contained in Sellers files) of why such
monies are held in suspense or other information identifying the proper
disposition of such monies. Buyer agrees to take and apply such monies in a
manner consistent with applicable Law and with prudent oil and gas business
practices and to indemnify Seller against any claim relating to the failure to
pay such funds after the Closing in accordance with the instructions or
information delivered to Buyer by Seller.

14.1(a)_ , _(b)_ , 14.1(c) and (e) (which expiration is on February 28, 2008
pursuant to _Sections 14.6(a)_ and _(b)_ ), Seller shall be entitled to
receive all amounts and/or Shares remaining in the Escrow Account except for
those amounts subject to a timely Claim Notice by Buyer under _ Section
14.8(a)_. If at such time such a Claim Notice is pending but only Shares
remain on deposit with the Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller, acting reasonably,
will agree to a number of Shares to be retained by the Escrow Agent as
would provide reasonable adequate security for Buyers claim.



 

40 13.8 _Removal of Name_.

As promptly as practicable, but in any case within 30 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall eliminate the name "Laramie Energy, LLC" and any variants
thereof from the Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement and, except with

of its Affiliates.

for which Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
hereunder.

14.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

(a) The indemnity, defense and hold harmless obligations set forth in
_Sections 14.1_ and _14.3_ shall not apply to (i) any amount that was taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions
hereof, and (ii) any partys costs and expenses with respect to the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the purchase and sale of
the Assets.



 

42 (b) Seller shall have no liability or obligation for any Losses under this
_Article XIV_ (excluding  _Section 14.1(d))_ unless the aggregate Losses
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover under this
_Article XIV_ exceed one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the "
_Indemnity Deductible_ ").

(c) In addition, in no event shall Seller be obligated under this Agreement to
indemnify Buyer for an aggregate amount of Losses (excluding Losses under
_Section 14.1(d)_) in excess of the $12,500,000 of the Purchase Price plus
the aggregate Current Market Value of the Shares retained in the Escrow
Account after Closing.

(d) Except with respect to Sellers indemnification obligations under Section
14.1(d), Buyers sole recourse (absent fraud) for indemnification claims
shall be to the Escrow Account, _first_ to the cash on deposit therein until
no such cash remains and _second_ to the Shares. With respect to Buyer
indemnification claims that are satisfied by delivery of Shares, such Shares
shall be valued at their Current Market Value calculated as of the date such
Shares are released from the Escrow Account for delivery to Buyer in
satisfaction of the applicable claim(s).

14.6 _Survival Provisions_.

in _Sections 7.1_ through _7.8_ , and Sellers and Buyers respective
indemnities with respect thereto, shall survive Closing indefinitely.

_Section 14.1(b)_ shall survive Closing until February 28, 2008. The
covenants, agreements, or obligations of Seller and Buyer in  _Section 13.7_

VIII_ , _Article XIII_ (other than _Section 13.7_) and _Section 15.18_ of
this Agreement, and the parties indemnities with respect thereto, shall
survive Closing until May 31, 2008.

(c) _Other Obligations_. The indemnifications and releases of Seller and Buyer
contained in _Sections 3.2_ , _5.1(b)_ , _5.3_ , _9.2_ , _13.5_ , _14.1(d)_ ,

ARE "CONSPICUOUS" DISCLAIMERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE OR
ORDER. THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND  



 

43  WARRANTIES OF SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TITLE WARRANTIES
IN THE CONVEYANCES OF THE PROPERTIES, THE LLC INTERESTS AND THE OTHER ASSETS
TO BE DELIVERED AT CLOSING, (COLLECTIVELY " _SELLER S WARRANTIES_") ARE
EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND
ALL SUCH OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE
FOREGOING AND EXCEPT FOR SELLERS WARRANTIES, THE ASSETS SHALL BE CONVEYED
PURSUANT HERETO WITHOUT (A) ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO (I) TITLE TO THE ASSETS, THE
CONDITION, QUANTITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMITY TO
THE MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OR MERCHANTABILITY OF ANY EQUIPMENT OR ITS

HEREAFTER FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, (III) PRICING ASSUMPTIONS, OR QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF HYDROCARBON
RESERVES (IF ANY) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROPERTIES OR THE ABILITY OR POTENTIAL
OF THE PROPERTIES TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS, (IV) THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF
THE PROPERTIES, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, (V) ANY IMPLIED OR
EXPRESS WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR (VI) ANY OTHER MATTERS CONTAINED IN
ANY MATERIALS FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER BY SELLER OR BY SELLERS
AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES, OR (B) ANY OTHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
OTHER WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WHATSOEVER. BUYER SHALL HAVE INSPECTED, OR
WAIVED (AND UPON CLOSING SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED) ITS RIGHT TO INSPECT,
THE ASSETS FOR ALL PURPOSES, AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THEIR PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, BOTH
SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY
RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, SOLID
WASTES, ASBESTOS AND OTHER MAN MADE FIBERS, OR NORM. BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY
UPON THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE ASSETS, AND
BUYER, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN
THEIR "AS IS, WHERE IS" CONDITION.

14.8 _Procedure_.

The indemnifications contained in _Sections 14.1_ and _14.3_ shall be
implemented as follows:

(a) _Claim Notice_. The party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall submit a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") which, to
be effective, must state: (i) the amount of each payment claimed by an
Indemnified Party to be owing, to the extent then quantifiable; (ii) the basis
for such claim, with supporting documentation; and (iii) a list identifying
to the extent  



 

44  reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for which payment is so
claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party as and
to, and only to, the extent required herein within 30 days after receipt of
the Claim Notice or after the amount of such payment has been finally
established, whichever last occurs.

(b) _Information_. Within 60 days after notification to an Indemnified Party
with respect to any claim or legal action or other matter that may result in
a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this _Article XIV_ , but
in any event in time sufficient for the Indemnifying Party to contest any
action, claim, proceeding or other matter that has become the subject
of proceedings before any court or tribunal, such Indemnified Party shall
give written notice of such claim, legal action or other matter to the
Indemnifying Party and, at the request of such Indemnifying Party, shall
furnish the Indemnifying Party or its counsel with copies of all pleadings
and other information with respect to such claim, legal action or other matter
and shall, at the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60 days after
receipt of such notice, permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of
such claim, legal action or other matter (to the extent only that such claim,
legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying
Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the
negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct
of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; _provided,
however,_ that no such settlement can result in any liability or cost to the
Indemnified Party for which it is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder, or
subject the Indemnified Party to any declaratory, injunctive or other
equitable relief or to regulatory sanctions or restrictions, without its
consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control: (i) any expense
incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of
the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party; and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than
pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such claim, legal action, or other matter. In the absence of such
an election, the Indemnified Party will use reasonable efforts to defend, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, any claim, legal action or other matter to
which the Indemnifying Partys indemnification under this _Article XIV_
applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense.

(c) _Dispute_. If the existence of a valid claim or amount to be paid by an
Indemnifying Party is in dispute, the parties agree to submit determination
of the existence of a valid claim or the amount to be paid pursuant to the
Claim Notice to the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in _Section
15.16_.

14.9 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_.

Nothing herein is intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer may
have against any Person other than the Seller Indemnified Parties, or which
Seller may have against any Person other than Buyer, for any obligations
or liabilities which may be incurred with respect to the Assets.



 

45 14.10 _Exclusive Remedy_.

The sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to the Assets shall be
pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement. Without limitation of
the foregoing, if the Closing occurs the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer,
for any and all (a) claims relating to any representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements that are contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered at Closing, (b) other claims pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement, and (c) other claims relating to the Assets
and the purchase and sale thereof, shall be any right to indemnification from
such claims that is expressly provided in this _Article XIV_ , and if no such
right of indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims are hereby
waived to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the Closing occurs, Buyer
shall also be deemed to have waived, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, any right to contribution against Seller (including, without
limitation, any contribution claim arising under any applicable Environmental
Law) and any and all other rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against Seller arising under or based on any federal, state or local statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation or common law or otherwise.

14.11 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_.

Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the payment of money, as limited by the
terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any
other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate
compensation, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
