submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;5.5</U> and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award the Buyer a greater Remediation
Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or

in the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;13.1</U>, then within ten days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount, and subject to <U>Article
