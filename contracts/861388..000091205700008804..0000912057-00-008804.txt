ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

      On February 27, 2000, LG&E Energy Corp., a Kentucky corporation (the
"Company"), PowerGen plc, an English public limited company ("PowerGen"), a
Delaware corporation to be formed as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
PowerGen ("US Subholdco 2") and a Kentucky corporation to be formed as a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of US Subholdco 2 ("Merger Sub"), entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company (the "Merger") with the Company surviving the Merger,
and the Company will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PowerGen.
In the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of the common stock, without
par value, of the Company will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive $24.85 in cash.

      In connection with the Merger, the Company has amended the terms of the
Rights Agreement, dated as of December 5, 1990, as amended as of May 20, 1997,
by and between the Company and Louisville Gas and Electric Company, as rights
agent (the "Rights Agreement"), so that the execution, delivery and performance
of the Merger Agreement will not cause any "Rights" (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) to become exercisable, cause PowerGen to become an "Acquiring Person"
(as defined in the Rights Agreement) or give rise to a "Distribution Date,"
"Stock Acquisition Date" or "Triggering Event" (as each such term is defined in
the Rights Agreement). The Merger Agreement, a press release relating thereto
and presentation materials relating to the analysts' meeting of February 28,
2000 are attached as exhibits and are incorporated by reference herein.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this "AGREEMENT"), dated as
of February 27, 2000, among LG&E Energy Corp., a Kentucky corporation (the
"COMPANY"), PowerGen plc, an English public limited company ("PARENT"), a
Delaware corporation to be formed as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("US SUBHOLDCO 2") and a Kentucky corporation to be formed as a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of US Subholdco 2 ("MERGER SUB," the Company and Merger
Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS").

                                    RECITALS

    WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and the
Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"MERGER") and approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

    WHEREAS, the Company and Parent desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement.

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                      THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

    1.1. MERGER SUB; THE MERGER.

    (a) Prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Parent shall
cause US Subholdco 2 to be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware,
Merger Sub to be incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and
shall cause such other intermediate companies or partnerships to be organized
under the laws of appropriate jurisdictions, substantially in accordance with
the diagram set forth in Section 1.1 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (as defined
in Section 5.2); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall be permitted to utilize
alternative structural arrangements to consummate the merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (in which case Parent shall promptly inform the
Company of such structural changes) so long as none of the effects described in
clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.22 could reasonably be expected to occur as
a result of the use of any such alternative arrangement. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause each of US Subholdco 2 and Merger Sub to authorize,
execute and deliver this Agreement and assume its obligations as a party
hereunder.

    (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company with all its liabilities, title to real
estate and other property and pending proceedings shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in Article II and Article III. The Merger shall
have the effects specified in the Kentucky Business Corporation Act of 1988, as
amended (the "KBCA").

    1.2. CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
(i) at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York
at 9:00 A.M. on the fifth Business Day (as defined below) after the last of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE"). As used in this
Agreement, the term "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday or a day on which banks in either New York City or the City of London,
England are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

    1.3. EFFECTIVE TIME. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause Articles of Merger (the "KENTUCKY ARTICLES OF
MERGER") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
<PAGE>
Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky as provided in
Section 271B.11-050 of the KBCA. The Merger shall become effective on the date
when the Kentucky Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

                                   ARTICLE II
                     ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS
                          OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

    2.1. THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. The amended and restated articles of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the
"ARTICLES"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law,
except that Article Fourth of the Articles shall be amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

    "The aggregate number of shares that the Company shall have the authority to
    issue is one thousand (1,000) shares of common stock without par value."

    2.2. THE BY-LAWS. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "BY-LAWS"), until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
                          OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

    3.1. DIRECTORS. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Articles and the By-Laws; provided that the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall, for the three years following the Effective Time, be
comprised of three directors, of which one shall be an individual who was either
an officer or a director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

    3.2. OFFICERS. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles and
the By-Laws.

    3.3. SURVIVING CORPORATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE. Mr. Roger W. Hale shall, if he
is willing and able, serve as an officer and director of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employment
Agreement between Mr. Roger W. Hale and Parent or the Company attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                     EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

    4.1. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of
the Company:

    (a) MERGER CONSIDERATION. Each share of the common stock, without par value,
of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK"), including the associated right to purchase
one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, without par value, of
the Company ("SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK"), or, in certain circumstances, Common
Stock or to receive other securities (each a "RIGHT" and, together with the
Common Stock, a "SHARE" and, collectively, the "Shares") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of

                                       2
<PAGE>
December 5, 1990, as amended as of May 20, 1997, by and between the Company and
Louisville Gas and Electric Company, as Rights Agent (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary
(as defined in Section 5.1(a)) of Parent (collectively, the "PARENT COMPANIES")
or Shares that are owned by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
the Company and in each case not held on behalf of third parties or Shares
("DISSENTING SHARES") that are owned by shareholders ("DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS")
who are entitled to dissent from corporate action under Section 271B.13-020 of
the KBCA and who exercise that right when and in the manner required by Sections
271B.13-020 through 271B.13-280 of the KBCA (each, an "EXCLUDED SHARE" and
collectively, "EXCLUDED SHARES")) shall be converted into the right to receive
$24.85 in cash (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). At the Effective Time, all Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate (a "CERTIFICATE") formerly representing any of
such Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

    (b) CANCELLATION OF SHARES. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Parent Companies or owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company (other than
Shares that are in each case owned on behalf of third parties), shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

    (c) MERGER SUB. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

    4.2. EXCHANGE OF CASH FOR SHARES.

    (a) PAYING AGENT. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause US
Subholdco 2 to deposit with a bank or trust company having a branch in New York
City selected by Parent with the Company's prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "PAYING AGENT"), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in
exchange for Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares) upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). The funds deposited with
the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as Parent and US
Subholdco 2 reasonably direct, PROVIDED that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, and any net profit resulting from,
or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or US Subholdco 2, as Parent directs.

    (b) PAYMENT PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of the number
of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records

                                       3
<PAGE>
of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

    For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "PERSON" shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or
other entity of any kind or nature organized or existing under the laws of any
jurisdiction.

    (c) TRANSFERS. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant
to this Article IV.

    (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent. Any holders of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings) the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, US Subholdco 2, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

    (e) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificates, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) of the number of Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger
Consideration upon due surrender of, and deliverable in respect of, the Shares
represented by such Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

    (f) WITHHOLDING OF TAX. US Subholdco 2 shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any former holder of Shares such amounts as US Subholdco 2 (or any affiliate
thereof) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code (as hereinafter defined) or any provision of state,
local, or foreign tax law, including the tax laws of the United Kingdom. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by US Subholdco 2, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by US Subholdco 2.

    4.3. DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive any of the Merger Consideration unless and until the holder thereof
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's right to dissent from the Merger under the KBCA, and any Dissenting
Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Sections
271B.13-010 through 271B.13-310 of the KBCA (the "DISSENTERS' RIGHTS STATUTE")
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. If any Person who
otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to properly
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent with
respect to any Shares, such Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such
Shares had been converted pursuant to Section 4.1(a) hereof. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for payment under the
Dissenters' Rights Statute, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable law received by the Company relating
to shareholders' right to

                                       4
<PAGE>
dissent or to receive payment under the Dissenters' Rights Statute and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand
for payment under the Dissenters' Rights Statute. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for payment under the Dissenters' Rights Statute with
respect to Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

    4.4. ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT DILUTION. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    5.1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as set forth in
the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter, dated the
date hereof, delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to entering into
this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

    (a) ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION. Each of the Company and
its subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or
to have such power or authority when taken together with all other such
failures, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the
Company's and its subsidiaries' articles of incorporation and by-laws, each as
amended to date. The Company's and its subsidiaries' articles of incorporation
and by-laws as so made available are in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each
jurisdiction where the Company and each of its subsidiaries is organized and
qualified to do business.

    As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "SUBSIDIARY" means, with respect to
the Company, any entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at
least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other
persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by the Company or by one or more of its subsidiaries or by the
Company and any one or more of its subsidiaries, and means, with respect to
Parent, any body corporate which is a subsidiary within the meaning of the
United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 (the "COMPANIES ACT"); (ii) "SUBSIDIARY"
means, with respect to Parent only, those subsidiaries or partnership interests
of the Parent identified as Parent Subsidiaries in Section 5.1(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter; (iii) "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means a material
adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business,
operations or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole, or any effect which prevents, materially delays or materially impairs
the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than (x) losses resulting from any increase in the Company's
reserves or other losses arising out of the contracts that were the subject of
the arbitration proceeding between Oglethorpe Power Corporation ("OPC") and the
Company for which an order was issued in December 1999 or (y) any effect from
the electric rate cases currently pending with the Kentucky Public Service
Commission (the "KPSC"), including, without limitation, the order issued by the

similar formulation of knowledge, including "known by it," shall mean, with
respect to Parent and its subsidiaries or the Company and its subsidiaries, as
applicable, the actual knowledge (after a reasonable investigation) of the
persons designated by Parent or the Company and set forth in Section 5.1(a) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter or Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
respectively; and (v) "JOINT VENTURE" shall mean with respect to Parent or its
subsidiaries only, those joint ventures of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
identified as a Parent Joint Venture in Section 5.1 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter.

    (b) CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 300,000,000 Shares, of which 129,677,030 Shares were outstanding as of the
close of business on February 25, 2000, and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
without par value, of which no shares are outstanding. All of the outstanding
Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Other than 750,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock reserved
for issuance and shares of Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, the Company has no Shares subject to issuance, except that, as
of February 25, 2000, there were 3,867,718 Shares subject to issuance pursuant
to the Company's Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company's
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Company's Deferred Stock
Compensation Plan (collectively, the "STOCK PLANS"). Section 5.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of each
outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans (each a "COMPANY
OPTION"), including the holder, date of grant, exercise price, expiration date
and number of Shares subject thereto. Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other securities of each of the Company's subsidiaries has been duly
authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is owned by a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. Except as set forth
above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company does
not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
the Company on any matter ("VOTING DEBT"). The Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth a true and complete list of each Person in which the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, any voting interest that may require a filing by Parent
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR ACT").

    (c) CORPORATE AUTHORITY; APPROVAL AND FAIRNESS. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate, subject only to approval of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares (the "COMPANY REQUISITE VOTE"),
the Merger. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement is a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles (the "BANKRUPTCY AND EQUITY
EXCEPTION").

    (ii) The board of directors of the Company (A) has adopted this Agreement
and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) has
received the opinion of its financial advisors, The Blackstone Group LP, to the
effect that, as of the date of the Agreement, the consideration to be received
by the holders of Shares in the Merger is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent.

Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

    (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach
or violation of, or a default under, the Company's articles of incorporation or
by-laws or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries or,

subsidiaries or joint ventures is subject or (C) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party pursuant to any of the Contracts binding upon the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or joint ventures, except, in the case of
clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration,
creation or change that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company (for purposes
of this Section 5.1(d)(ii) only, without any obligation to conduct any
investigation), Section 5.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list of material Contracts of the Company and its
subsidiaries and joint ventures pursuant to which consents or waivers (the
"COMPANY REQUIRED CONSENTS") are or may be required prior to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (collectively, including any
such reports filed subsequent to the date hereof and as amended, the "COMPANY
REPORTS"). As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of such
amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with the
SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or

material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income
and of changes in shareholders' equity and in cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes
and schedules) presents fairly, or will present fairly, the results of
operations and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that
will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance with

consistently applied during the periods indicated, except as may be noted
therein and except, with respect to unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC.

    (f) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, from the Audit Date through the date hereof, the
Company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures have conducted their respective
businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than
according to, the ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not
been (i) any change in the condition (financial or otherwise), properties,
business, operations or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any development or combination of
developments of which the Company has knowledge that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any
material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any material
asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; (iii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend, or other distribution in cash, stock

capital stock, combination, subdivision or reclassification of any of the
Company's capital stock or issuance or authorization of any issuance of any
other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of its

Company or its subsidiaries in accounting principles, practices or methods.
Since the Audit Date, except as provided for herein or as disclosed in the
Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there has not been any increase
in the compensation payable by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
officers or key employees or any amendment of any of the Compensation and
Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(h)(i)) except for increases or
amendments in the ordinary and usual course.

    (g) LITIGATION AND LIABILITIES. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports
filed prior to the date hereof, there are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Affiliates (as defined below), (ii) orders, judgments, decrees,
injunctions or rules of any Governmental Entity to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or joint ventures is subject, (iii) to the knowledge of the
Company, obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed, of the Company or any of
its Affiliates or (iv) developments since the date of such Company Reports with
respect to such disclosed actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or
proceedings, except, in each case, for those that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company

                                       8
<PAGE>
Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, the term "AFFILIATE" shall have the
meaning ascribed to such term in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

    (h) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

    (i) A copy of each material bonus, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, employment, termination,
severance, compensation, medical, health or other plan, agreement, policy or
arrangement that covers current or former employees or current or former
directors of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT
PLANS") and any trust agreement or insurance contract forming a part of any such
Compensation and Benefit Plans has been made available to Parent prior to the
date hereof. The Compensation and Benefit Plans are listed in Section 5.1(h) of
the Company Disclosure Letter and any "change of control" or similar provisions
therein are specifically identified in Section 5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

    (ii) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (A) each Compensation and Benefit Plan is in
substantial compliance with all applicable law, including the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "CODE") and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA") and (B) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in
a transaction with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that, assuming
the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would
subject the Company or any of its subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Each Compensation and
Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "PENSION PLAN") and that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and the Company is not aware of
any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no material pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened litigation relating to the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

    (iii) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (A) no liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of
ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
"single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of
any entity which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001
of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") and (B) the Company
and its subsidiaries have not incurred in the last five years and do not
reasonably expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E to Title IV of ERISA regardless of whether
based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate. To the knowledge of the Company,
no notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the
12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    (iv) Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within
the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

    (v) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer
plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date
hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities,"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis
of the actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension Plan's most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial
condition of such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

                                       9

    (vi) Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan. The
Company or its subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan under the terms
of such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

    (vii) The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not (x) entitle any employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries to severance pay or (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

    (viii) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) all Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering current or former non-U.S. employees or former employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries comply with applicable local law and
(B) the Company and its subsidiaries have no unfunded liabilities with respect
to any Pension Plan that covers such non-U.S. employees in any foreign
jurisdiction where funding of such plan is required by applicable law.

    (i) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS; PERMITS. Except as set
forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the businesses of
each of the Company and its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company,
of each of its joint ventures have not been, and are not being, conducted in
violation of, default under or non-compliance with any federal, state, local or
foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction,
decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, writ, franchise, variance,
exemption, approval, license or permit of any Governmental Entity (each, a "Law"
and collectively, "Laws"), except for violations, defaults or non-compliance
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or joint ventures is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company, (i) no material change is required
in the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' or joint ventures' processes,
properties or procedures in connection with any Laws in effect on the date
hereof or enacted as of the date hereof and scheduled to be effective after the
date hereof, and (ii) the Company has not received any notice or communication
of any material noncompliance with any Laws that has not been cured as of the
date hereof, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for those changes or
failures to cure, that individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries and
joint ventures has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions,
orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals necessary
to conduct its business as presently conducted, except for those the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2(f) is true and correct, no "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation in the
United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (each a "TAKEOVER
STATUTE") or any anti-takeover provision in the Company's articles of
incorporation or by-laws is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the
Shares, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

hereof, delivered to the Company by Parent on or prior to entering into this
Agreement (the "PARENT DISCLOSURE LETTER"), Parent hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that:

    (a)  CAPITALIZATION OF MERGER SUB AND US SUBHOLDCO 2.  The authorized
capital stock of each of Merger Sub and US Subholdco 2 at the Effective Time
will consist only of shares of common stock, without par value, all of which
shall be validly issued, fully paid and outstanding. At the Effective Time, all

shares of capital stock or voting securities of Merger Sub or US Subholdco 2,

arrangements therefor and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    (b)  ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION.  Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated or organized, validly existing
and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept
of good standing) under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own and operate its assets or properties and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so incorporated or organized, qualified or in such good
standing, or to have such power or authority when taken together with all other
such failures, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of
the Parent's memorandum and articles of association, each as currently in full
force and effect.

    As used in this Agreement, the term "PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), properties,
business, operations or results of operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole or any effect which prevents, materially delays or materially
impairs the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

    (c)  CORPORATE AUTHORITY.  Parent has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger subject only to the approval of (i) the Merger, and (ii) any increase in
Parent's borrowing powers as set out in its articles of association required in
connection with the Merger or the Financing Plan (as defined in

shareholders of Parent (the "PARENT REQUISITE VOTE"). Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, this

Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the Effective Time, Merger Sub will have all requisite
corporate power and authority and will have taken all corporate action necessary
in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger.

of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that
the failure to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent
does not (and by Merger Sub will not), and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,
constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
articles of incorporation or by-laws of Merger Sub or, subject to the Parent
Requisite Vote, the articles of association and memorandum of association of
Parent or the comparable governing instruments of any of its subsidiaries or, to
Parent's knowledge, joint ventures, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default

<PAGE>
Kentucky Utilities Company, Louisville Gas and Electric Company or LG&E Capital
Corp. (in each case, determined on a consolidated basis) or any substantial
portion of the equity securities of any of the Company, Kentucky Utilities
Company, Louisville Gas and Electric Company or LG&E Capital Corp. (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL").
The Company further agrees that (i) it and its officers and directors shall not,
(ii) its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries' officers and directors shall not,
and (iii) that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any confidential information

facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or its Board of Directors from (A) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
(B) providing access to its properties, books and records and providing
information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors

confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7)(except for such
changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement); (C) engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal; or (D) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders of the Company or withdrawing or modifying in any adverse manner
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, if and only to the extent
that, in each case referred to in clauses (B), (C) or (D), (i) the Company
Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained and (ii) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with
their fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal
counsel and financial advisors that, (x) in the case of clause (D) above only,
such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
similar aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to
in this Agreement as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") and (y) in the case of clauses
(B) and (C) above only, such actions could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (iv) such actions do not continue for more than twenty
business days with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (or amendment thereto).
The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it
will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities
referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.3 and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company agrees that it
will notify Parent promptly if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, on the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its subsidiaries to
return all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries.

    (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company's board of
directors determines in good faith, on the basis of the advice of its financial
advisors and outside counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was
unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 6.3(a),
that such proposal is a

                                       23
<PAGE>
Superior Proposal, the Company or its board of directors may terminate this
Agreement if, and only if, the Company shall concurrently with such termination
enter into a definitive agreement containing the terms of a Superior Proposal;
PROVIDED HOWEVER, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence, shall
be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have complied with
(i) all the provisions of this Section 6.3, including the notification
provisions in this Section 6.3, (ii) the following proviso, and (iii) all
applicable requirements of Section 8.3, including the payment of the termination
fee described in Section 8.5(b) prior to such termination; and PROVIDED,

this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.3 until after five business days

Proposal and that such board of directors will, subject to any action taken by
Parent pursuant to this sentence, cause the Company to accept such Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal

and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material term of a
Superior Proposal shall require an additional Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new five business day period).

make all necessary arrangements with respect to the Stock Plans to permit the
assumption of the unexercised Company Options by Parent pursuant to this
Section. For purposes of this Section, the term "CONVERSION RATIO" means a
fraction, the numerator of which is the average of the high and low sales price
of one Share on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective
Time and the denominator of which is the average of the high and low sales price
of one ADS on the NYSE on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder of such Company Option, if such
holder elects in writing delivered to the Company at least three business days
prior to the Effective Time, may at the Effective Time exchange each such
Company Option, whether or not then exercisable, for an amount in cash to be
paid by the Company, equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess of the difference between the
Merger Consideration over the per Share exercise price of such Company Option,
less any amount the Company is required to deduct or withhold with respect to
such payment. Each such Company Option so exchanged shall be immediately
canceled.

    (ii) Effective at the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each Company
Option still outstanding in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan under
which it was issued and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares for
delivery upon exercise of Company Options assumed by it in accordance with this
Section. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form F-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form with respect
to the ADS's subject to such Company Options, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding.

    (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
ADS's or options to acquire ADS's pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
("SECTION 16").

    (iv) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Share awarded as a restricted
Share shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 4.1(a) of this Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the restricted Shares shall not vest and the restrictions thereon
shall not lapse on and until the first day immediately following the Effective
Time, and the Merger Consideration shall thereafter be paid to each holder of
such formerly restricted Shares at the same time and on the same terms as
provided in Section 4.2 of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all necessary actions in order to effectuate the foregoing.

                                       27
<PAGE>
    (b)  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary thereof, the employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") will continue to
be provided with benefits under employee benefit plans (other than plans
involving the issuance of Shares) that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those currently provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to such
employees as of the date hereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor all employee benefit obligations to current and former
employees under the Compensation and Benefit Plans and all employee severance
plans (or policies) in existence on the date hereof and all employment or
severance agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by the board of
directors of the Company prior to the date hereof and disclosed to Parent.

    (c)  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN.  Notwithstanding anything set forth in
Section 6.11(b) to the contrary, in the event that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation fails to maintain equity-based employee benefit plans for the
benefit of the Company Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide for a period of at least twenty-four months following
the Effective Time, a long-term incentive plan for the benefit of the Company
Employees, which plan would provide such Company Employees with bonuses or other
payments, upon the achievement of reasonable performance criteria, which are no
less favorable than the value of the equity-based compensation otherwise
provided for under the long-term incentive Compensation and Benefit Plans as in
existence immediately prior to the date hereof.

    (d)  ELECTION TO PARENT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  At the Effective Time of the
Merger, Parent shall promptly increase the size of its Board of Directors in
order to cause Roger W. Hale to be appointed to Parent's Board of Directors.
Roger W. Hale shall be entitled to serve on Parent's board of directors in
accordance with Roger W. Hale's Employment Agreement.

    (e)  ADVISORY BOARD.  The directors of the Company at the Effective Time
shall, after the Effective Time, serve as members of a U.S. advisory board to
provide advice with respect to operations of the Company and its subsidiaries,
businesses and regulatory developments in the United States generally and such
other matters as the members of the advisory board, Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree.

    6.12.  EXPENSES.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring
such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with printing and
mailing the Proxy Statement and the Circular shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company.

    6.13.  INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE.  (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and its subsidiaries
(when acting in such capacity) determined as of the Effective Time (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "COSTS") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including all liabilities to the extent they are
based in whole or in part on or arise in whole or in part out of or pertain to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company or, if applicable, such subsidiary, would have been permitted under the
KBCA or other relevant state statute and the Company's or, if applicable, such
subsidiary's, articles of incorporation and its by-laws in effect on the date
hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification).

                                       28
<PAGE>
    (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.13, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure prejudices Parent. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor
are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request,
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Parent will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under applicable law and the articles of incorporation or
bylaws shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and
the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm or counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, except to the extent there is, in the
opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions
of such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Parties, in which case each Indemnified Party with a conflicting position on a
significant issue shall be entitled to retain separate counsel satisfactory to
it (subject to the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld),
(ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter
and (iii) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and PROVIDED FURTHER that Parent shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable Law. In the event any Indemnified Party is required
to bring any action to enforce rights against, or to collect moneys due from,
Parent under this Agreement and is successful in such action, Parent shall
reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its reasonable expenses in bringing
and pursuing such action.

    (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O INSURANCE") for a period of
six years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not
in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the
"CURRENT PREMIUM"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies (which may be "tail" policies) containing terms
with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable in any material respect to
such directors and officers; (ii) if the existing D&O Insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation
will use its best efforts to obtain as much D&O Insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized
basis) of 200% of the Current Premium; and (iii) if the annual premiums for the
existing D&O Insurance exceeds 200% of the Current Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the best coverage available for the
remainder of such period, for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis)
of 200% of the Current Premium.

    (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.13. The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

    (e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, from and after the Effective
Time, all rights to indemnification as of the date hereof in favor of the
employees, agents, directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
with respect to their activities as such prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in their

                                       29
<PAGE>
respective articles of incorporation and by-laws or comparable documents (or any
other document containing such rights) in effect on the date hereof, or
otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from
the Effective Time, provided that in the event any claim or claims are asserted
or made within such six-year period (provided that nothing herein shall be
deemed to extend or otherwise modify any statute of limitations with respect to
any claim), all such rights to the indemnification in respect of such claim or
claims shall continue until the final disposition thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may amend or modify the terms of the articles of incorporation
or by-laws or comparable documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
after the Effective Time so long as the modification or amendment does not
adversely affect the indemnification rights provided for in the last preceding
sentence.

    6.14.  TAKEOVER STATUTES.  If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions consistent with their
fiduciary duties and applicable law as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

    6.15.  FINANCING.  Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the financing contemplated by the Financing Plan or alternative financing
therefor on substantially similar terms sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger.

    6.16.  TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.  The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its subsidiaries to, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, take any action that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize the
qualification of any outstanding revenue bonds which qualify on the date hereof
under Section 142(a) of the Code as "exempt facility bonds" or as tax-exempt
industrial development bonds under Section 103(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended, prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

    6.17.  PUHCA; REGULATORY STATUS.  Except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries
to, take any action that would cause a change in the Company's status as an
exempt public utility holding company under the PUHCA.

    6.18.  DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS.  The Company shall enter into transactions in
Derivative Products only in a manner consistent with the operating practices
described to Parent and employed by the Company during the previous 18 months.
From and after the date hereof, all transactions in Derivative Products (related
to continuing operations) entered into, and all open positions in and portfolios
of Derivative Products maintained, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
shall at all times be in compliance with the Trading Policies (as defined below)
in all material respects. In addition, the Company shall not (a) maintain an
overall short position without the approval of Parent; (b) maintain an overall
long position over the budgeted amount of forecasted excess generation capacity
without the approval of Parent; (c) write call options exceeding adequate excess
generation capacity without the approval of Parent; and (d) write put options
unless load is forecasted to exceed economic generation without the approval of
Parent. From and after the date hereof, all transactions in Derivative Products
(related to discontinued operations) entered into, and all open positions in and
portfolios of Derivative Products maintained, by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, shall at all times be used only in mitigation of existing risk in
the discontinued merchant portfolios.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.18, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries may enter into a transaction or maintain a position in a
Derivative Product that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 6.18 with the prior approval of Parent. Parent and the Company agree to
promptly cause employees of their respective energy trading businesses to meet
and revise the Trading Policies to conform to the Company's current practices in
energy trading and further to reflect the parties' views of the best practice
across energy trading policies worldwide, with such modifications from such

                                       30
<PAGE>
practices as Parent and the Company may agree. The Company agrees to provide
Parent with copies of daily and other periodic or special credit or other risk
management reports relating to the Company's positions in Derivative Products in
a timely manner (in the case of daily reports, they shall be made available no
later than one day after production) together with such other information as
Parent may reasonably request and to consult with Parent regarding the contents
of such on at least a weekly basis as Parent requests and to give reasonable
consideration to any views of Parent.

    As used in this Agreement, (i) "APPROVED COMMODITIES" means those
commodities approved within the Trading Policies and (ii) "TRADING POLICIES"
shall mean the Company's Statement of Trading, dated March 22, 1999.

    6.19.  POST-MERGER OPERATIONS.  Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall conduct its operations in accordance with the following:

    (a) Principal Corporate Offices. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain
its principal corporate offices in the city of Louisville, in the State of
Kentucky.

    (b) Maintenance of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky
Utilities Company. Louisville Gas and Electric Company on the one hand, and
Kentucky Utilities Company on the other hand, shall continue their separate
corporate existences, operating under the names of "Louisville Gas and Electric
Company" and "Kentucky Utilities Company," respectively. The respective
corporate officers of Louisville Gas and Electric Company, on the one hand, and
Kentucky Utilities Company on the other hand, shall be entitled to maintain
their current titles and responsibilities as officers of Louisville Gas and
Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, respectively, unless and until
otherwise determined by the board of directors of Louisville Gas and Electric
Company and the board of directors of Kentucky Utilities Company, respectively,
and the respective headquarters of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and
Kentucky Utilities Company shall be maintained as the headquarters of Louisville
Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company.

    (c) Charities. After the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to continue to, make annual charitable and community
contributions to the communities served by the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise maintain a substantial level of involvement in community activities in
the State of Kentucky that is comparable to, or greater than, the normal annual
aggregate level of charitable contributions, community development and related
activities carried on by the Company prior to the date hereof. Parent
acknowledges that the primary purpose of the LG&E Energy Foundation Inc. is to
support charitable causes in the service territories of Louisville Gas and
Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, respectively, and shall cause,
and shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation causes, the LG&E Energy
Foundation Inc. to continue to support charitable causes in such service
territories, with such Foundation remaining under the control of the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation, it being agreed that a majority of such
Foundation's board members shall consist of individuals who reside within the
Surviving Corporation's service territory.

    (d) Name. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "LG&E Energy Corp."

    6.20.  CONTROL OF OTHER PARTY'S BUSINESS.  Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct Parent's operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over their respective operations.

    6.21.  THIRD PARTY STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS.  During the period from the date
of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of or release
any of its rights under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it
is a party; PROVIDED, that if, prior to the date on which the Company Requisite
Vote is obtained, such

                                       31
<PAGE>
action is required in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply
with its fiduciary duties, the Company may take such action to the extent
necessary to comply with such fiduciary obligation. During such period, the
Company shall, except as aforesaid, take all steps necessary to enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including, but not limited to, by obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction.

    6.22.  CERTAIN MERGERS.  Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall
not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to (i) acquire or agree to
acquire any assets or (ii) acquire or agree to acquire, whether by merger,
consolidation, by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity
in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (A) impose
any material delay in the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period or impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or significantly
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders,
declarations or approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
Merger, (B) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering
an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (C) significantly increase
the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or
(D) materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger.

    6.23.  NECESSARY ACTION.  Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective subsidiaries, shall take or fail to take any action that is
reasonably likely to result in any failure of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VII, or is reasonably likely to make any representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent contained herein inaccurate in any material
respect at, or as of any time prior to, the Effective Time, or that is
reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

    6.24.  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  The parties expressly acknowledge and agree
that, although it is their current intention to effect a business combination
among themselves in the form contemplated by this Agreement, it may be
preferable to effectuate such a business combination by means of an alternative
structure in light of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and 7.2(c).
Accordingly, if the only conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate
the Merger which are not satisfied or waived are the receipt of any one or more
of the Company Required Statutory Approvals, Parent Required Statutory
Approvals, Parent Required Consents, Company Required Consents or Governmental
Consents (as defined in Section 7.1(b)), and the adoption of an alternative
structure (that does not result in a substantial diminution for Parent or the
Company of the economic benefits expected to be realized from the Merger or from
the utilization of the structure set forth in Section 1.1 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter) would result in such conditions being satisfied or waived,
then the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to effect a
business combination among themselves by means of a mutually agreed upon
structure other than the Merger that does not result in such diminution;
PROVIDED that, prior to closing any such restructured transaction, all material
third party and Governmental Entity declarations, filings, registrations,
notices, authorizations, consents or approvals necessary for the effectuation of
such alternative business combination shall have been obtained and all other
conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth in
Article VII, as applied to such alternative business combination, shall have
been satisfied or waived.

    6.25.  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF MERGER SUB AND US SUBHOLDCO 2.  Prior to the
Effective Time, except as may be required by applicable Law and subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub and US
Subholdco 2 (i) to perform each of their respective obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) not to engage directly or
indirectly in any business or activities of any type or kind and not to enter
into any agreements or arrangements with any Person (other than such agreements
or arrangements as may be necessary or advisable in connection with obtaining
the financing for the Merger), or be subject to or bound by any obligation or
undertaking (other than such obligations or undertakings as may be necessary or
advisable in connection with obtaining the financing for the Merger) which is a
breach of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                   CONDITIONS

satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of each of the
following conditions:

    (a)  STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.  This Agreement shall have been duly approved by
holders of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote in accordance with
applicable law and the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, and
the Merger and the matter set forth in Section 5.2(c)(ii) with respect to which
the approval of Parent's shareholders is required shall have been approved by

thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall
have expired or been terminated, (ii) review and investigation of the Merger
under Exon-Florio shall have been terminated and the President of the United
States shall have taken no action authorized under Exon-Florio with respect to
the Merger (iii) the Company Required Statutory Approvals and the Parent
Required Statutory Approvals shall have been made or obtained and shall have
become a Final Order, and (iv) all other consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations required to be obtained in order to lawfully
consummate the Merger prior to the Effective Time by the Company or Parent or
any of their respective subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS") in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
have been made or obtained (as the case may be) and shall have become a Final
Order, except for those that the failure to make or to obtain, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. A "FINAL ORDER" means action by the
relevant Governmental Entity which has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set
aside, annulled or suspended, with respect to which any waiting period
prescribed by law before the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
has expired, and as to which all conditions to the consummation of such
transactions prescribed by law, regulation or order have been satisfied.

    (c)  LITIGATION.  No court or Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains,
enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, an "ORDER").

    7.2.  CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB.  The obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:

    (a)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Sections 5.1(b), 5.1(c)(i), 5.1(f)(iii), (iv) and (v),

true and correct in all material respects (a) on the date hereof and (b) on and
as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though such representations and
warranties had been made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly speak only as of a specific date
or time other than the date hereof or the Closing Date, which need only be true
and correct in all material respects as of such date or time), and all other
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall
be true and correct (i) on the date hereof and (ii) on and as of the Closing
Date with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties
that expressly speak only as of a specific date or time other than the date
hereof or the Closing Date, which need only be true and correct as of such date
or

                                       33
<PAGE>
time) except in each of cases (i) and (ii) for such failures to be true and
correct (considered for this purpose only, and not for purposes of determining
whether they are true and correct in the first instance, without regard to any
Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar qualifications contained
therein) which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and Parent shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the
Company to such effect.

    (b)  PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer
of the Company to such effect.

    (c)  CONSENTS UNDER AGREEMENTS.  The Company shall have obtained the Company
Required Consents, except to the extent the failure to obtain any consent or
approval, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

    (d)  PUHCA APPROVAL.  The SEC shall have issued an order or orders under the
PUHCA authorizing the Merger, the financing of the Merger and other matters
related thereto, which order or orders do not contain any terms or conditions
that (i) adversely affect in any material respect the financing or capital
raising activities of any subsidiary of Parent that qualifies as a "foreign
utility company" (as such term is defined under PUHCA), excluding for this
purpose any effects on such financing or capital raising activities that arise
from (A) Parent's obligation under such order or orders to maintain or achieve a
debt to equity ratio (on a consolidated basis) of not less than 70 percent to
30 percent (but not excluding any effects on such financing or capital raising
that arise from any order or orders imposing a lesser debt to equity ratio),
(B) investment limits applicable to Parent pursuant to Rule 58 under PUHCA,
(C) limitations on Parent's ability to provide guarantees, equity contributions
or other credit support to such "foreign utility companies" without the SEC's
prior approval under PUHCA, or (D) any financial or other commitments agreed to
by Parent in its application to register as a registered holding company or in
any other application under PUHCA associated with the Merger, or (ii) provide
for SEC jurisdiction under PUHCA with respect to any subsidiary of Parent that
qualifies as a "foreign utility company" (as such term is defined under PUHCA)

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                  TERMINATION

    8.1.  TERMINATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT.  This Agreement may be terminated and

approval by the shareholders of the Company or Parent (the "TERMINATION DATE");
PROVIDED that the Termination Date shall be automatically extended for 6 months
(the "EXTENDED DATE") if, on August 31, 2001: (i) any of the

<PAGE>
Governmental Consents described in Section 7.1(b), 7.2(d), 7.2(f), 7.2(g) or

(b) the approval of the Company's shareholders required by Section 7.1(a) shall
not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof, (c) the approval of Parent's shareholders as required
by Section 7.1(a) shall not have been obtained at a meeting duly convened
therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or (d) (i) any Order
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Merger shall become final and non-appealable (whether before or after the
approval by the shareholders of the Company or Parent), or (ii) any Law is in
effect or is adopted or issued, which has the effect of prohibiting the Merger;
PROVIDED that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (a) above
shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated.

    8.3.  TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY.  This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the approval by shareholders of the Company referred to in
Section 7.1(a), by action of the board of directors of the Company and written
notice to Parent if: (a) the board of directors of Parent shall have withdrawn
or adversely modified its approval or recommendation of the Merger, (b) there
has been a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is not curable
and such breach would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), (c) in accordance with, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, Section 6.3(b), or (d) Parent shall fail to deliver or
cause to be delivered the amount of cash to the Paying Agent required pursuant

Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the approval by the shareholders of Parent referred to in
Section 7.1(a), by action of the Board of Directors of Parent and written notice

withdrawn or adversely modified its adoption or recommendation of this Agreement
or shall have approved or recommended a Superior Proposal, or (b) there has been
a material breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement that is not curable and such breach would
give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) or (c) Shares or other securities or assets are issued or
delivered pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement upon or following the
occurrence of a Distribution Date, a Stock Acquisition Date or a Triggering
Event (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) or an Acquiring Person (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) becoming such.

    8.5.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT.  (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this
Article VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall
become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto
(or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial
advisors or other representatives); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any
willful and material breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination. The parties agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.5 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. The parties further
agree that if any party is or becomes obligated to pay a termination fee
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c), the right to receive such
termination fee shall be the sole remedy for damages of the other party with
respect to the facts and circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation
except for any willful and material breach of this Agreement. No party may
assert a claim for damages for any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement (whether by

                                       36
<PAGE>
direct claim or counterclaim) except in connection with the termination of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be deemed willfully and materially breached
by Parent or Merger Sub with regard to any failure to deliver to the Paying
Agent funds pursuant to Section 4.2(a) so long as the covenant in Section 6.15
is not willfully and materially breached.

    (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4(a) or 8.4(c), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(c), then the Company shall, promptly, but in no event
later than two business days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a
termination fee of $90,000,000 and shall promptly, but in no event later than
two business days after being notified of the amount of all documented
out-of-pocket charges and expenses ("OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES") by Parent, pay all
of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a
maximum amount of $10,000,000, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to 8.4(b), then (A) the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than two business days after being notified of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses
by Parent, pay all of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred by Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000, payable by wire transfer of
same day funds (but only if, in the case of clause (i), the Parent Requisite
Vote shall have been received) and (B) if, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have, in the case of clause (i), become public prior to the date of the
Shareholders Meeting or, in the case of clause (ii), been made to the Company or
become public prior to the date of termination, and within 18 months from the
date of termination, the Company executes and delivers an agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being
understood that in the event the board of directors of the Company recommends
the acceptance by the shareholders of the Company of a third-party tender offer
or exchange offer for the Shares, such recommendation shall be treated as though
an agreement had been executed), the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than two business days after the date of such execution and delivery, or
consummation, as the case may be, pay Parent a termination fee of $90,000,000.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
the fee set forth in this paragraph (b), the Company shall pay to Parent or
Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

    (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(d), then Parent shall, promptly, but in no event later
than two business days after the date of such termination, pay the Company a
termination fee of $90,000,000 and shall promptly, but in no event later than
two business days after being notified of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses by the
Company, pay all of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000, in each case payable by wire
transfer of same day funds. In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(c) or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then (A) Parent shall
promptly, but in no event later than two business days after being notified of
the Out-of-Pocket Expenses by the Company, pay all of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $10,000,000, payable by
wire transfer of same day funds (but only if, in the case of clause (i), the
Company Requisite Vote shall have been received) and (B) if, a bona fide Parent
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) shall have, in the case of clause (i),
become public prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting or, in the
case of clause (ii), been made to Parent or become public prior to the date

                                       37
<PAGE>
of termination, and within 18 months from the date of termination, Parent
executes and delivers an agreement with respect to a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase
of all or any substantial portion of the assets or equity securities of, Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (a "PARENT ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") or a Parent
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being understood that in the event the
board of directors of Parent recommends the acceptance by the shareholders of
Parent of a third-party tender offer or exchange offer for Parent Ordinary
Shares, such recommendation shall be treated as though an agreement had been
executed), Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days
after the date of such execution and delivery, or consummation, as the case may
be, pay the Company a termination fee of $90,000,000. Parent acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements,
the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(c), and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a judgment
against Parent for the fee set forth in this paragraph (c), Parent shall pay to
the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

    9.11.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed

invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or

                                       40
<PAGE>
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the
application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

    9.12.  INTERPRETATION.  The table of contents and headings herein are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the singular
shall include the plural, the use of the masculine shall include the feminine,
and vice versa. As used in this Agreement, the antecedent of any personal
pronoun shall be deemed to be only the next preceding proper noun or nouns, as
appropriate for such pronoun. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any
law, rule or regulation shall be deemed to include a reference to any
amendments, revisions or successor provisions to such law, rule or regulation.

    9.13.  ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be
a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub so long as such designation
would not reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the
obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv) materially delay the consummation of
the Merger. If the requirements of the previous sentence are met and Parent
wishes to designate another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, then, all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with
respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation. Subject to
this Section 9.13, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

    9.14.  SUCCESSORS.  In the event that (a) any scheme of arrangement pursuant
to Section 425 of the Companies Act between Parent and the holders of the Parent
Ordinary Shares becomes effective as a result of which the Parent Ordinary
Shares cease to be listed on the LSE, or (b) Parent or any of its successors or

                        LG&E ENERGY/POWERGEN TRANSACTION
                       LG&E ENERGY ANALYST CONFERENCE CALL
                                FEBRUARY 28, 2000
                                  9 A.M. (EST)


- -        Good morning. Thank you for joining us today on such short notice. We
         are here to discuss this morning's announcement that PowerGen will
         acquire LG&E Energy - a transaction that will provide tremendous value
         for LG&E Energy shareholders.

- -        Joining me on the call today are: Foster Duncan, our chief financial
         officer; John McCall, our general counsel; Charlie Markel, our vice
         president of finance and treasurer; and Steve Cave, our investor
         relations manager. Peter Hickson, group finance director of PowerGen,
         is joining us from London.

- -        By now, I'm sure you have seen the announcement and know the details of
         the transaction. To make the best use of your time, I'll make a few
         brief comments about the deal, then we will take any questions you may
         have.

- -        The combination of these two financially strong, well-managed companies
         will result in significant benefits for our investors, our customers,
         our employees and the communities we serve worldwide. It provides both
         companies with a unique opportunity to achieve the size, scale and
         geographic reach necessary to succeed in a competitive market.

- -        The transaction is an all-cash deal resulting in a 58 percent premium
         to investors (over Friday's closing price). LG&E Energy will become the
         U.S. headquarters for PowerGen and serve as PowerGen's growth vehicle
         to expand its operations here in the future.

- -        The senior management team at LG&E Energy will remain in place. I will
         continue as chairman and chief executive officer of LG&E Energy, and
         will join PowerGen's board of directors in London.

- -        We will move aggressively to obtain all of the necessary approvals,
         including shareholders of both companies and the federal and state
         regulatory agencies. The Kentucky Public Service Commission, by
         statutory requirement, must rule on the merger application within 60
         days, and we believe the benefits this deal brings to the Commonwealth
         of Kentucky will be evident to the Commission. We expect to complete
         the transaction within nine to 12 months from today.

- -        Let me briefly tell you why we are doing this transaction at this time.

- -        The evolving competitive nature of our industry has clearly demanded
         creative and unique growth strategies. As you know, for most of the
         past 10 years, LG&E Energy has been a successful industry innovator in
         many areas and has delivered overall returns to its shareholders well
         above industry averages until 1999.

- -        However, today the state and nature of the industry has changed. Size
         and scale have become a significant prerequisite for developing and
         executing on any viable growth strategy. Most of the major utility
         players today started with large size and have gotten even bigger and
         far more aggressive.

- -        Even though LG&E Energy is now nearly five times its size of 10 years
         ago, we are limited in our ability to continually make a significant
         impact on the current market, and then deliver the year-over-year
         increasing growth rates now demanded by investors.

- -        Consequently, the merger with PowerGen is an immediate opportunity to
         provide significant value to shareholders now - while at the same time,
         maintaining our first

         mover status in the industry as the platform to help PowerGen grow
         throughout the U.S.

- -        As an integral part of this transaction, we will maintain our respected
         name, operations and efficient corporate structure. As a result,
         Kentucky will continue to enjoy the nation's highest quality of service
         and some of its lowest rates. We will enhance our corporate presence as
         one of Kentucky's major sponsors of educational, civic and cultural
         initiatives, and provide for our employees an opportunity to continue
         their rewarding careers with a major global energy corporation.

- -        Now, we would be happy to answer any questions you have at this time.
