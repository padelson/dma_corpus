2.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
Company Charter and Bylaws, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation and
as a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser.

  


 

  

2.2 _The Closing and the Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place remotely,
via the exchange of documents, signatures and deliveries effective as of 12:01
a.m. Eastern time on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than the conditions with respect to
actions the respective parties will take at the Closing itself), or at such
other place or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Purchaser and
the Company. The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ " _._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated on the Closing Date by
filing the Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, as required by, and executed in accordance
with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be
agreed upon in writing by Purchaser and the Company and specified in the
Certificate of Merger, shall be referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_
").

  


 

  

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
parties hereto, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be

effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be changed to the current name of the Company,
until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

 

17  

  

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise
agreed by the parties hereto prior to the Effective Time, the directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become

certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

2.6 _Effect of the Merger on the Company Stock, Stock Awards and Merger Sub_.

  


 

  

(a) _Effect on the Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
Company Stockholders, each class, series and subclass of Company Stock (other
than Dissenting Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
_Section 2.6_ and elsewhere in this Agreement, will be cancelled and
extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to receive that
portion of the Final Merger Consideration as set forth herein and shall no
longer be outstanding.

  


 

  

(i) Each class, series and subclass of Company Stock (other than Dissenting
Stock) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive a portion of the Final Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall, upon surrender of
a Certificate or a lost stock affidavit in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.7(f)_.

  


 

  

(ii) Each share of Dissenting Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto in
accordance with _Section 2.12_.

  


 

  

(iii) Solely for purposes of calculating the amount to be paid to each Company
Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Stock) at the Effective Time,
the amounts described in this _Section 2.6(a)_ shall be calculated assuming
that the Final Merger Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Initial
Consideration plus the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, and shall be adjusted following the Closing as set forth
herein. The amount to be paid to each Company Stockholder for each class,
series and subclass of Company Stock (other than Dissenting Stock) held shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

  


 

  

(iv) All classes, series and subclasses of Company Stock, when cancelled,
extinguished, and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.6(a)_ , shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and
each former holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration provided for in this
_Section 2.6(a)_.

  

  

 

18  

  

(v) None of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries) will have any Liability
to the Sellers' Representative, any Seller or any other Person with respect to
the Distribution Waterfall and the calculation or allocation of the Final
Merger Consideration (other than for Purchaser's obligation to make payment of
the Final Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement).

  


 

  

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub 's Capital Stock_. At and as of the Effective
Time, each share of Merger Sub's capital stock shall be converted into one
share of Surviving Corporation's capital stock. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of any such capital stock of Merger Sub shall automatically be
deemed to evidence ownership of such interests of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Any Company Stock that is owned by the
Company and not issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(d) _Stock Awards_.

  


 

  

(i) At the Closing, each then outstanding Stock Award will, by virtue of the
Closing and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and each outstanding Stock Award will be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (collectively, the " _Award Payments_ ") equal to,
(A) in the case of an Option, the product of (x) the number of shares of
Common Shares for which such Option is exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) and (y) the excess, if any, of the
portion of the Final Merger Consideration each share of Common Stock is to
receive in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall over the per share
exercise price of such Option, as calculated pursuant to the formula set forth
on the Award Payments schedule prepared by the Company, as set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall, and (B) in the case of an Cash Settled Award, the
product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock referenced in the Cash
Settled Award and (y) the portion of the Final Merger Consideration each such
referenced share of Common Stock is to receive in accordance with the
Distribution Waterfall, as calculated pursuant to the formula set forth on the
Award Payments schedule prepared by the Company, as set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall, in all cases to be paid in accordance with the
original vesting schedule (including any acceleration terms) of each
applicable Stock Award. At the Effective Time all Stock Awards shall terminate
and the holders thereof shall be entitled only to payment of the Award
Payments on the original vesting dates applicable to the Stock Awards, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to continued service
of the Company Awardholder with the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser
on each applicable vesting date, had such Stock Award not been canceled and
extinguished at the Effective Time in accordance with this _Section 2.6(d)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the Award Payments payable at the
Effective Time shall be included in Aggregate Initial Consideration and all
Award Payments shall be included in the Final Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

19  

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (A) deliver, or (with respect to
payments to an employing Subsidiary) cause the Company to deliver, to the
Company or the applicable employing Subsidiary thereof, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company or the
applicable employing Subsidiary, an amount equal to the respective portion of
the Award Payments payable at Closing calculated pursuant to the original
vesting schedule (including any acceleration terms) of such Stock Awards less
the Company Awardholders' Pro Rata Share of each of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund; and (B) deliver, or cause the Company to deliver, to the Escrow
Agent, the portion of Award Payments payable after Closing (such amount,
together with any interest and income earned thereon, the " _Award Escrow
Fund_ "). Purchaser shall cause the Company and the applicable employing
Subsidiary to distribute the Award Payments payable at Closing to the holders
of Stock Awards through the Company's or the applicable Subsidiaries' payroll
systems as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, upon delivery of a
Letter of Transmittal in a form to be agreed between Purchaser and the Company
by the Closing (an " _Awardholder Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such portion of the Award Payments payable with respect to Section
102 Options and Section 3(i) Options at Closing shall be transferred at the
Effective Time to the Section 102 Trustee, on behalf of the holders thereof,
and will be held in trust and released by the Section 102 Trustee pursuant to
the applicable provisions of Section 102 and the Israeli Options Tax Ruling
(or the Interim Options Tax Ruling, as applicable), subject to the surrender
by the holder thereof of a duly executed Awardholder Letter of Transmittal.
Any payment or delivery of cash by the Company (at the direction of Purchaser)
in satisfaction of Purchaser's obligation to pay the Aggregate Initial
Consideration (whether Award Payments or otherwise) shall be treated as if
such payments were made immediately after the Effective Time for purposes of
(x) calculation of Aggregate Initial Consideration and (y) determination of
Sellers' liability hereunder.

  


 

  

(iii) On each scheduled vesting date to occur after the Closing pursuant to
the original vesting schedule (including any acceleration terms) of the Stock
Award, (A) the Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Company, the applicable
employing Subsidiary or the 102 Trustee (with respect to Section 102 Options
and Section 3(i) Options), from the Award Escrow Fund for payment to the
holder of such Stock Award, and the (B) subject to the provisions of the
Israeli Options Tax Ruling, the Section 102 Trustee shall make payment with
respect to Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options of, in each case, in
an amount equal to the Award Payment for the portion of such unvested Option
that has vested on such date, as set forth in the Distribution Waterfall.

  


 

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Award
Escrow Fund or Award Payments held by the Escrow Agent shall only be used to
make payment to holders of unvested Stock Awards on the applicable scheduled
vesting date with respect to such Stock Awards subject to continued service of
the Company Awardholder with the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser on
such scheduled vesting date in accordance with the terms of such Stock Award
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, had such Stock Award not
been canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time in accordance with
_Section 2.6(d)_. Any portion of the Award Payments held by the Escrow Agent
remaining immediately after the last scheduled vesting date of the Stock
Awards shall be within five (5) Business Days thereafter transferred to the
Payments Administrator, and the Payments Administrator shall disburse such
amount to the holders of Common Stock (other than Dissenting Stock) that was
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and to the
Company, the applicable employing Subsidiary or the 102 Trustee, for further
distribution to the holders of Stock Awards that are vested as of the last
vesting date of the Stock Awards (assuming the Stock Awards would not have
been canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time in accordance with
_Section 2.6(d)_ ), pro rata, based on the numbers of shares held by each and
underlying such holder's Stock Award, as set forth in the Distribution
Waterfall, which amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the allocation of
the Final Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

  

  

 

20  

  

(v) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Closing, the Company Board shall adopt all
resolutions and take all other actions (as may be necessary or required in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Stock Plan or otherwise to
terminate each Stock Award effective as of the Closing, to effectuate all of
the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.6(d)_ and to ensure that, from and
after the Closing, each outstanding Stock Award canceled pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(d)_ shall have no rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Award Payments in accordance with this _Section 2.6(d)_ ,
without interest.

  


 

  

2.7 _Mechanism of Payment and Delivery of Certificates; Notice to Company
Stockholders_.

  


 

  

(a) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall appoint Acquiom Clearinghouse LLC or another Person reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the payments administrator (the "
_Payments Administrator_ ") and enter into a payments administrator agreement
with such Payments Administrator and with the Sellers\' Representative, as the
representative of the Sellers, in a form to be agreed between Purchaser, the
Company and the Sellers' Representative by the Closing (the " _Payments
Agreement_ ") for the purpose of paying the Final Merger Consideration in
accordance with the Distribution Waterfall. At the Effective Time, Purchaser
or Merger Sub shall deliver, or Purchaser or Merger Sub shall otherwise take
all steps necessary to cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Payments Administrator, solely for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders (other than the holders of Dissenting Stock), cash in an
aggregate amount equal to the Aggregate Initial Consideration (less the
Sellers' Representative Expense Fund and the Award Payments payable at Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)(ii)_ ) (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall be used solely and exclusively for purposes of paying the consideration
specified in _Section 2.6(a)_ (including as contemplated by _Section 2.7(c)_ )
and shall not be used to satisfy any other obligations of any member of the
Company Group. The Payments Administrator shall make the payments provided for
in _Section 2.6_ (including as contemplated by _Section 2.7(c)_ ) out of the
Payment Fund.

  


 

  

(b) To the extent required, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after such date), mail or otherwise deliver to each Company Stockholder
(i) a letter from the Company with respect to each Company Stockholder who did
not execute the Stockholders Consent, (I) providing the notification required
by Section 228(e) of the DGCL with respect to the Stockholders Consent and
(II) if the right is not waived in the Support Agreement, providing such
Company Stockholder with a brief information statement regarding the Company
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and a notice in the manner
contemplated in Section 262 of the DGCL of such Company Stockholder's right to
dissent to the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) the
Stockholder Letter of Transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and payments contemplated by this _Section 2.7_.
The Company shall afford Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the documents described in this _Section 2.7(b)_ prior to such
mailing or delivery and shall consider in good faith Purchaser's comments
thereto.

  

  

 

21  

  

(c) To the extent that a Company Stockholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Stock) delivers a Letter of Transmittal in the form of _Exhibit G_
hereto (a " _Stockholder Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and a certificate
representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") or a lost stock affidavit and indemnity (as described in
_Section 2.7(f)_ ) to the Company prior to the Closing, the Payments
Administrator shall pay to such Company Stockholder promptly upon the Closing
cash in an amount set forth for such Company Stockholder in the Distribution
Waterfall, which amounts shall be paid by the Payments Administrator in
accordance with the instructions provided by such Company Stockholder, subject
to applicable Tax withholding in accordance with _Section_ 2.8 below.
Following the Closing, upon surrender by a Company Stockholder (other than a
holder of Dissenting Stock) to the Payment Administrator of a Certificate,
together with a Stockholder Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, such Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive, as soon as practicable but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after such surrender, in exchange therefor, cash in an
amount set forth for such Company Stockholder in the Distribution Waterfall,
which amounts shall be paid by the Payments Administrator by check or wire
transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such Company
Stockholder, subject to applicable Tax withholding in accordance with _Section
2.8_ below. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate. If
the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate was surrendered, it
shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(c)_ , each
Certificate (other than those representing Dissenting Stock or Company Stock
to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ ) shall represent, for all
purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the portion of
the Final Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.6(a)_ in respect of the Company Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, without any interest or dividends thereon.

  


 

  

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (i) which relates to any Dissenting Stock
or (ii) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock as of the
date that is the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, shall be
delivered to Purchaser upon demand by Purchaser. Any holders of Company Stock
(other than Dissenting Stock) who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_ shall thereafter look only to
Purchaser for satisfaction of their claims for the Final Merger Consideration
payable with respect to the shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Certificates, without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

(e) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a
holder of Certificates or any other Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered or
transferred by the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Final Merger Consideration, dividends
(whether in cash, stock or property) or other distributions with respect to
Company Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any foreign, federal, state or local governments or
governmental agency), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 

22  

  

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity (in the form attached to
the Stockholders Letter of Transmittal) of that fact by the Person (who shall
be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Final Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

2.8 _Tax Withholding_.

  


 

  

(a) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, the Payments
Administrator and the Escrow Agent (each a " _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Seller, or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law
(including Israeli Tax Laws, as set forth in _Sections 2.8(b)_ , _2.8(c)_ ,
_2.8(d)_ and _2.8(e)_ below) as reasonably determined by Purchaser; _provided_
, that Purchaser shall provide three (3) Business Days' advance written notice
to any affected Seller prior to deducting or withholding any such amounts. For
the purposes of this _Section 2.8_ , "Business Day" shall mean any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks in the U.S.
or Israel are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain
closed.

  

  

 

23  

  

(b) With respect to Israeli Tax to be withheld pursuant to applicable Laws,
the Aggregate Initial Consideration payable to each of such Company
Stockholders (each a " _Payee_ ") hereunder at the Closing (excluding amounts
held in the Escrow Funds or the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund) and any
additional amounts paid under _Section 2.11_ , shall be paid to and retained
by the Payments Administrator for the benefit of each such Payee for a period
of 180 days from Closing, or an earlier date requested in writing by such
Payee or as otherwise requested in writing by the ITA (the Payor shall
promptly notify the applicable Payee of such written request by the ITA) (the
" _Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during which time no Payor shall withhold any
Israeli Tax on such consideration, except as provided below or as requested in
writing by the ITA), and during which time each Payee may (i) obtain a
certification or ruling issued by the ITA in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include,
except with respect to payments to employees or to payments outside of Israel,
a certification pursuant to the Israeli Income Tax Regulations (Withholding
from Payments for Services or Assets), 5737 - 1977, not specifically referring
to the transaction under this Agreement, if applicable to the relevant
payments), (x) exempting Payor from the duty to withhold Israeli Taxes with
respect to the applicable consideration of such Payee, (y) determining the
applicable rate of Israeli Tax to be withheld from the applicable
consideration of such Payee or (z) providing any other instructions regarding
the payment or withholding with respect to the applicable consideration of
such Payee (including transfer of the withholding Tax amount to a trustee) or
(ii) solely with respect to the Persons listed in _Schedule 2.8(b)_ , provide
such other documentation and evidence described in _Schedule 2.8(b)_ (the "
_Qualified Withholding Certificate_ "). In the event that no later than three
(3) Business Day prior to a Withholding Drop Date, a Payee submits a Qualified
Withholding Certificate, the Payments Administrator shall act in accordance
with the provisions of such Qualified Withholding Certificate, subject to any
deduction and withholding as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code, or any provision of any other state, local or foreign Tax Law (other
than Israeli Tax Law). If any Payee (A) does not provide Purchaser and the
Payments Administrator with a Qualified Withholding Certificate, no later than
three (3) Business Day prior to a Withholding Drop Date, or (B) submits a
written request to Purchaser and the Payments Administrator to release his,
her or its portion of the applicable Aggregate Initial Consideration and any
additional amounts paid under _Section 2.11_ held by the Payments
Administrator prior to the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a
Qualified Withholding Certificate at or before such time then the amount to be
withheld from such Payee's portion of the Aggregate Initial Consideration and
any additional amounts paid under _Section 2.11_ shall be calculated according
to the applicable withholding rate (increased by interest and Israeli Consumer
Price Index adjustments, as defined in Section 159A of the Israeli Tax
Ordinance, for the period between the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar
month following the month during which the Closing occurs and the time the
relevant payment is made, and calculated in NIS based on a USD:NIS exchange
rate not lower than the representative rate of exchange on the Closing Date)
as reasonably determined by Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
absence of a Qualified Withholding Certificate that also applies to the
applicable portion of the Escrow Funds and the Sellers' Representative Expense
Fund, the calculation of the applicable amount to be withheld from the amount
to be paid to a Payee at Closing will also include the applicable amount to be
withheld from such Payee's portion of the Escrow Funds and the Sellers'
Representative Expense Fund. It is hereby clarified that with respect to
Company Stock held in trust in accordance with that certain ruling issued by
the ITA dated November 13, 2014 (the " _Restructuring Ruling_ "), no Israeli
Tax will be withheld by any Payor upon payment of the respective portion of
the Aggregate Initial Consideration or the Final Merger Consideration to the
trustee holdings such Company Stock and such Restructuring Ruling shall be
deemed to be a Qualified Withholding Certificate for the purpose of this
_Section 2.8_.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any payments made to
holders of Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options will be subject to
deduction or withholding of Israeli Tax under the Israeli Tax Ordinance on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month following the month during which the
Closing occurs, unless the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or the Interim Options
Tax Ruling shall have been obtained before the fifteenth day of the calendar
month following the month during which the Closing occurs.

  

  

 

24  

  

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
cause its Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the ITA an application for
a ruling in relation to the Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options,
confirming, among others, that: (i) the payment of the Award Payments for
Section 102 Options, which remain subject to the statutory minimum trust
period under such Section 102 will not constitute a violation of the
requirements of Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Ordinance; (ii) Purchaser and
anyone acting on its behalf, shall be exempt from withholding Tax in relation
to any payments or consideration transferred to the Section 102 Trustee in
relation to Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options; and (iii) that the
Escrow Funds and the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund distributions in
respect of Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options shall not be subject
to Israeli Tax until actually received by the holder thereof; which ruling may
be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling
(the " _Israeli Options Tax Ruling_ "). If the Israeli Options Tax Ruling is
not granted prior to the Closing, the Company shall seek to receive prior to
the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among others, that Purchaser and
anyone acting on its behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding Tax in
relation to any payments made to the Section 102 Trustee with respect to
Section 102 Options and Section 3(i) Options (which ruling may be subject to
customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the " _Interim
Options Tax Ruling_ "). The Company shall cause its Israeli counsel,
accountants and other advisors, to coordinate all activities in relation to
obtaining the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (and Interim Options Tax Ruling) with
Purchaser and its Israeli counsel and to coordinate any activities with
Purchaser and its Israeli counsel, including any written or oral submissions,
and meetings with the ITA. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
parties shall cooperate to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
commercially reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
commercially reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Israeli Options Tax Ruling (and Interim Options Tax Ruling) as promptly as
practicable. The language of the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (and Interim
Options Tax Ruling) shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Purchaser or its counsel, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Should any meeting be held with the ITA at which
Purchaser's counsel does not attend, Company's counsel shall provide Purchaser
and its counsel with a complete update and summary of such meeting or
discussion within one (1) Business Day of such meeting or discussion.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, solely with respect to
any payments made to non-Israeli tax residents holders of Stock Awards or
Company Stock issued upon exercise of Stock Awards, which holders (i) were
granted such awards in consideration for work or services performed outside of
Israel for the Company or for a non-Israeli Subsidiary of the Company, and
(ii) will provide the Payor, at least three (3) Business Days prior to any
payment to them a validly executed declaration, in a form attached to the
Awardholders Letter of Transmittal, confirming their non-Israeli tax residence
and that they were granted such awards in consideration for work or services
performed solely outside of Israel for the Company or for a non-Israeli
subsidiary of the Company, such payments shall not be subject to any
withholding or deduction of Israeli Tax and shall be made through the payroll
processing service or system of the relevant employing company, without
advanced notice for withholding.

  


 

  

(f) To the extent that any amounts are deducted or withheld in accordance with
this _Section 2.8_ , such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid and shall be timely remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Stock_. The portion of the
Final Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock, and, upon
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Stock which was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

25  

  

2.10 _Repaid Indebtedness; Sellers ' Transaction Expenses_. It is contemplated
by the parties that, upon the Closing, all Indebtedness which is listed on the
" _Repaid Indebtedness Schedule_ " attached hereto as _Schedule 2.10_ , will
be fully repaid (the " _Repaid Indebtedness_ ") and that Purchaser shall make
such repayment on behalf of the Company Group at the Closing (to the extent
not paid by the Company Group prior to the Closing). In order to facilitate
such repayment, prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and deliver to
Purchaser executed and effective payoff letters for all Repaid Indebtedness of
the Company Group, which payoff letters shall acknowledge the aggregate
principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest constituting the Repaid
Indebtedness. In addition, it is contemplated by the parties hereto that, upon
the Closing, all of the Sellers' Transaction Expenses (to the extent not paid
by the Company Group prior to the Closing) will be fully paid, and that such
payment will be funded by Purchaser. Subject to the satisfaction of the
Company Group's conditions, covenants and obligations to be satisfied prior to
the Closing, in connection with the Closing, Purchaser shall make payment of
the unpaid Sellers' Transaction Expenses at the Closing in order to discharge
the amounts payable thereunder.

  


 

  

2.11 _Working Capital and Cash Adjustment_.

  


 

  

(a) _Determination of Closing Adjustment_. No later than four (4) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide Purchaser with (i) a good
faith estimate of Working Capital as of the Closing (" _Estimated Working
Capital_ "), a good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Cash of the
Company Group as of the Closing (" _Estimated Cash_ "), a good faith estimate
of Indebtedness of the Company Group as of the Closing, on a consolidated
basis (and, for clarity, without duplications of amounts or items included in
Working Capital or excluded from Cash) (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), a
good faith estimate of the Sellers' Transaction Expenses as of the Closing
(the " _Estimated Sellers ' Transaction Expenses_") and the amount by which
the Aggregate Initial Consideration is to be adjusted on account thereof
(together with reasonable detail for such estimates and calculations), in each
case, prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth on _Schedule
1.1(C)_ and (ii) the Distribution Waterfall reflecting the Aggregate Initial
Consideration and any changes in the Company Stock and Stock Awards since the
date hereof. Purchaser shall have an opportunity to provide any comments it
may have to the Estimated Working Capital and the Aggregate Initial
Consideration to the Company, and the Company shall consider in good faith
(unless there is a reasonable basis not to do so) any revisions to the
Estimated Working Capital and the Aggregate Initial Consideration as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than seventy-five
(75) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representative the calculation of the actual Working Capital as of the Closing
(" _Actual Working Capital_ ") (prepared in accordance with the " _Working
Capital Schedule_ " attached hereto), a calculation of the actual Indebtedness
of the Company Group as of the Closing Date (" _Actual Indebtedness_ "), a
calculation of the actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses as of the Closing ("
_Actual Sellers ' Transaction Expenses_") and a calculation of the actual Cash
of the Company Group as of the Closing (" _Actual Cash_ ").

  

  

 

26  

  

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

  


 

  

(i) No later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses and Actual Cash, the Sellers' Representative shall notify
Purchaser in writing whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses and Actual Cash. During such thirty (30) day period, the
Sellers' Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access to
the financial books and records of Purchaser and the Company Group as well as
any relevant work papers as it may reasonably request to enable it to evaluate
the Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses and Actual Cash; _provided_ , that such access shall be in a manner
that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation. If the Sellers' Representative accepts the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses and Actual Cash determined pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_
, or if the Sellers' Representative fails within such thirty (30) day period
to notify Purchaser of any dispute with respect thereto, then the calculation
of Actual Working Capital determined pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ shall be
the " _Final Working Capital_ ", the calculation of Actual Indebtedness
determined pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ shall be the " _Final Indebtedness_
", the calculation of Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses determined pursuant
to _Section 2.11(b)_ shall be the " _Final Sellers ' Transaction Expenses_"
and the calculation of Actual Cash determined pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_
shall be the " _Final Cash_ " which, in each case, shall be deemed final and
conclusive and binding.

  


 

  

(ii) If the Sellers' Representative disputes the accuracy of the calculation
of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses or Actual Cash, the Sellers' Representative shall provide written
notice to Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by
Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative of the calculation of Actual Working
Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Actual
Cash (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), setting forth each item that the Sellers'
Representative disputes and the basis for its disagreement therewith. During
the thirty (30) day period following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith with a view to
resolving their disagreements over the disputed items. During such thirty (30)
day period and until the final determination of Actual Working Capital, Actual
Indebtedness, Actual Sellers' Transaction Expenses and/or Actual Cash in
accordance with this _Section 2.11(c)(ii)_ or _Section 2.11(c)(iii)_ , as the
case may be (as so determined, or as determined pursuant to _Section
2.11(c)(i)_ above, " _Final Working Capital_ ", " _Final Indebtedness_ ," "
_Final Sellers ' Transaction Expenses_" and " _Final Cash,_ " respectively),
the Sellers' Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access
to the financial books and records of Purchaser and the Company Group as it
may reasonably request; _provided_ , that such access shall be in a manner
that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation. If the parties resolve their differences over the
disputed items in accordance with the foregoing procedure, Final Working
Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Final
Cash shall be the amounts agreed upon by them. If the parties fail to resolve
their differences over the disputed items within such thirty (30) day period,
then Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall forthwith jointly request
that an accountant, to be mutually agreed to at the time (and if not agreed,
such accountant will be a partner of a reputable U.S. national independent
certified public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by a partner of each of
the respective accounting firms representing Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative in such dispute) (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") make a
binding determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement.

  

  

 

27  

  

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will under the terms of its engagement have no
more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than ten (10)
Business Days from the final submission of information and testimony by
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative within which to render its written
decision with respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any
unresolved disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and the final
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses and Actual Cash shall be based solely on the resolution
of such disputed items. The Accounting Arbitrator shall review such
submissions and base its determination solely on such submissions. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value
to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either
party or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either party.
The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final and binding
upon the parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction and
the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Working Capital shall
be deemed the " _Final Working Capital_ ", the Accounting Arbitrator's final
calculation of Actual Indebtedness shall be deemed the " _Final Indebtedness_
", the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Sellers'
Transaction Expenses shall be deemed the " _Final Sellers ' Transaction
Expenses_" and the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Cash
shall be deemed the " _Final Cash_ ". The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be allocated to be paid by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers, severally and not
jointly, in proportion to their pro rata share of the Final Merger
Consideration set forth on the Distribution Waterfall (the " _Pro Rata Share_
")), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

  


 

  

(d) _Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital and Final Cash_.

  


 

  

(i) Following the determination of Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness,
Final Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Final Cash, the Aggregate Initial
Consideration shall be recalculated by substituting the Final Working Capital
for the Estimated Working Capital in _Section 1.1_ , the Final Indebtedness
for the Estimated Indebtedness in _Section 1.1_ , the Final Sellers'
Transaction Expenses for the Estimated Sellers' Transaction Expenses in
_Section 1.1_ and the Final Cash for the Estimated Cash in _Section 1.1_ (the
" _Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration_ ") and if (after taking into
account any Upward Closing Working Capital Adjustment or Downward Closing
Working Capital Adjustment at the Closing) (A) the Adjusted Aggregate Initial
Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Initial Consideration at the
Closing, then such difference shall be promptly paid by Purchaser to the
Payments Administrator (for further distribution to the Company Stockholders
in accordance with their Pro Rata Share) and to the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or the Section 102 Trustee, as applicable (for the further
distribution to the Company Awardholders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share); or (B) the Aggregate Initial Consideration on the Closing Date is
greater than the Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration, then Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative shall promptly deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to Purchaser out of
the Purchase Price Escrow Fund the lesser of (x) such difference and (y) the
entire amount of the Purchase Price Escrow Fund.

  

  

 

28  

  

(ii) In the event that the full amount (if any) by which the Aggregate Initial
Consideration on the Closing Date exceeds the Adjusted Aggregate Initial
Consideration is greater than the Purchase Price Escrow Fund (such excess, the
" _Shortfall Amount_ "), Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release to Purchaser, from the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the
Shortfall Amount and to the extent that the Shortfall Amount is greater than
the Indemnification Escrow Fund, Purchaser shall have no recourse against the
Sellers' Representative, the Sellers or any other Person with respect to such
amount that exceeds the Indemnification Escrow Fund. If there are funds
remaining in the Purchase Price Escrow Fund following payment pursuant to this
clause (d), Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay all
such remaining funds to the Payments Administrator (for further distribution
to the Company Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share) and to
the Surviving Corporation or the Section 102 Trustee, as applicable (for the
further distribution to the Company Awardholders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share).

  


 

  

(iii) All payments pursuant to this _Section 2.11(d)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance by
the Sellers' Representative, the Company, the Section 102 Trustee or
Purchaser, as applicable, and all such payments and releases from the Purchase
Price Escrow Fund or the Indemnification Escrow Fund, as applicable, shall be
made on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following: (A) the thirty
(30) day period following Purchaser's delivery of the calculation of the
Actual Working Capital, Actual Indebtedness, Actual Sellers' Transaction
Expenses and Actual Cash pursuant to _Section 2.11(b)_ if the Sellers'
Representative does not timely dispute any such amounts pursuant to _Section
2.11(c)(i)_ ; (B) the date of the Sellers' Representative's and Purchaser's
mutual determination of Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final
Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Final Cash in the event the Sellers'
Representative timely disputes any such amounts pursuant to _Section
2.11(c)(i)_ and the Sellers' Representative's and Purchaser's differences are
resolved without the engagement of an Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to
_Section 2.11(c)(ii)_ ; and (C) the date of the Accounting Arbitrator's
determination of Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Sellers'
Transaction Expenses and/or Final Cash pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)(iii)_ in
the event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes any such amounts
pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)(i)_ and the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser
are unable to resolve their differences pursuant to _Section 2.11(c)(ii)_.

  


 

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.11_ to the contrary, if prior
to the determination of the Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final
Sellers' Transaction Expenses and Final Cash, the amounts that are in dispute
in accordance with _Section 2.11(c)_ may only result in an increase to the
Final Merger Consideration or in a decrease to the Final Merger Consideration
in an amount that is less than the Purchase Price Escrow Fund, then Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to pay the remaining Purchase Price Escrow Fund, less such
disputed amounts which may result in a decrease of the Final Merger
Consideration, to the Payments Administrator (for further distribution to the
Company Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share) and to the
Surviving Corporation or the Section 102 Trustee, as applicable (for the
further distribution to the Company Awardholders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share).

  

  

 

29  

  

2.12 _Dissenting Stock_.

  


 

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including
_Section 2.6_ , shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by Company Stockholders (other than
shares of Company Stock that are canceled pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ) who
shall not have voted in favor of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly exercised appraisal
rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Stock_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, any portion of the Aggregate Initial
Consideration or Final Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Such holders of Company Stock shall be entitled to receive
payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Stock held by the holders of Company Stock who shall have failed to
perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive any portion of the Aggregate Initial
Consideration and Final Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided herein, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced
such shares or the execution and delivery of a lost stock affidavit to the
Company as set forth in _Section 2.7(c)_. Purchaser shall be entitled to
retain any Aggregate Initial Consideration or Final Merger Consideration not
paid on account of the Dissenting Stock pending resolution of the claims of
such holders, and the remaining Company Stockholders shall not be entitled to
any portion of such retained Aggregate Initial Consideration or Final Merger
Consideration.

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall provide (i) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
any withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) Purchaser the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  


 

  

2.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares; Closing of Transfer Books_. At
the Effective Time, the transfer books of the Company Stock shall be closed
and no transfer of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date as of or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered shares of Company Stock, including shares of Dissenting
Stock.

action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Purchaser hereby consents
to the taking of such action by the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require any party hereto to take or agree to take, or cause to be taken, any
action with respect to its assets, business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

Contract by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated

whatsoever to Purchaser (and Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any
claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that
may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of or loss of right under any such Contract or other agreement as
a result thereof.

transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser intends to obtain, and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser prior to the Closing in order to obtain a purchaser-side

to Losses suffered or incurred from claims under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and
_Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ subject to the other provisions in _Article 9_
applicable to such Losses and claims; _provided_ , _that_ the failure by
Purchaser to obtain such a Representation and Warranty Policy by the Closing

otherwise applicable under the provisions in _Article 9_ hereof and, in the
event of such failure to obtain the Representation and Warranty Policy, the
cost of the insurance policy (or any portion thereof) shall not be considered
a Sellers' Transaction Expense.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

  

 _REGARDING THE COMPANY GROUP_

  


 

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub,
subject to the disclosures set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered to
Purchaser concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (with specific reference to the Section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure relates except to
the extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure relates to another section or schedule) as follows:

  


 

  

5.1 _Organization and Power; Subsidiaries and Investments_.

  


 

  

(a) Each member of the Company Group is duly organized, validly existing, and
where applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Each member of the Company Group has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. Except as set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule

stock, partnership interest, joint venture interest, equity participation or
other security or interest in any other Person.

  


 

  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, each
member of the Company Group is qualified to do business as a foreign entity
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction listed in _Section 5.1(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule _,_ which jurisdictions constitute all of the
jurisdictions in which the ownership of properties or the conduct of the
Business requires such member of the Company Group to be so qualified, except
where the failure to be so qualified or authorized and in good standing is not
material to the Business. Each member of the Company Group has all requisite
corporate power, authority and legal capacity to carry on its business as now
conducted. The Organizational Documents of each member of the Company Group,
which have previously been furnished to Purchaser, reflect all amendments
thereto, and are correct and complete in all respects. No member of the

validly authorized by the members of the Company Group, as the case may be,
and no other act or proceeding on the part of any member of the Company Group,
their respective governing bodies or stockholders is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery or performance by the Company Group of this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby to which it is a party or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming
the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby by the other parties hereto and thereto, this Agreement
constitutes, and the other agreements contemplated hereby to which it is a
party upon execution and delivery by the members of the Company Group, as
applicable, will each constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
such member of the Company Group, enforceable against such Person in
accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (i) applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity.

  


 

  

(b) The affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of (i) a majority
of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and (ii) a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, are the only votes or consents of any
class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary (under the Company
Charter and Bylaws, the DGCL or otherwise) for the adoption and approval of

actions taken by any member of the Company Group relating to the solicitation
and obtaining of written consents from holders of Company Stock with respect
to the Merger have been and will be taken in compliance with all Laws and in
accordance with the fiduciary duties of the Company's directors.

rights by other parties to purchase any shares of Company Stock required in

the Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Payments Administrator Agreement, with full power of substitution or re-
substitution and authority on each Seller's behalf, notwithstanding any
dispute or disagreement among the Sellers after the Closing (i) to consummate
the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) to pay such Seller's expenses
(whether incurred on or after the date hereof) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement to the extent funds are
available in the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund, (iii) to receive, give
receipt and disburse the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund received
hereunder on behalf of or to such Seller and each other Seller and to holdback
from disbursement any such funds to the extent it reasonably determines may be
necessary, (iv) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller all documents
contemplated herein and any amendment or waiver hereto after the Closing, (v)
to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Seller in
connection herewith, (vi) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise
handle all disputes under this Agreement, including without limitation,
disputes regarding Estimated Working Capital and any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.11_ , (vii) to give and receive notices on behalf of the Sellers
and (viii) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Seller is, or the Sellers collectively are, permitted or required to do or
exercise under this Agreement. The Sellers, by approving the Merger and/or
accepting the consideration payable to them hereunder, irrevocably grant unto
said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform
each and every act and thing necessary or desirable to be done in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents
and purposes as the Sellers might or could do in person. Each of the Sellers
agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Sellers' Representative and shall
survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of any Seller.

  

  

 

67  

  

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to conclusively rely on all decisions,
actions, consents, instructions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers'
Representative, all of which decisions, actions, consents, instructions or
omissions shall be legally binding upon the Sellers. Solely as between the
Sellers' Representative and the Sellers, all decisions, actions, consents and
instructions taken or omitted to be taken by the Sellers' Representative shall
be final and binding upon all the Sellers and no Seller shall have any right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same without derogating
from any other agreement that the Sellers have with the Sellers'
Representative. Neither the Sellers' Representative nor any agent employed by
Sellers' Representative shall incur any Liability with respect to any action
or omission of the Sellers' Representative in connection with the Sellers'
Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto except for actions or omissions constituting fraud, bad faith
or willful misconduct. The Sellers' Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller. The Sellers'
Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) The Sellers shall cooperate with the Sellers' Representative and any
accountants, attorneys or other agents whom the Sellers' Representative may
retain to assist in carrying out Sellers' Representative's duties hereunder.
The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the Sellers'
Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers'
Representative shall reimburse the Sellers the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Sellers' Representative by the
Sellers, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Sellers'
Representative from (i) the funds in the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund,
and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Funds at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers; _provided_ , that while this
section allows the Sellers' Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Sellers from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Sellers' Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event shall the Sellers'
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers
or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the
Sellers set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Sellers' Representative under
this Section. The foregoing indemnities shall survive the Closing and the
resignation or removal of the Sellers' Representative or the termination of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that the Sellers' Representative becomes unable to perform
the Sellers' Representative's responsibilities or resigns from such position,
the Company Stockholders holding, prior to the Closing, at least 70% of the
Company Stock shall select another representative to fill such vacancy and
such substituted representative shall (i) be deemed to be the Sellers'
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise the rights
and powers of, and be entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and other
benefits of, the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

 

68  

  

(e) At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representative an amount equal to $250,000 (the " _Sellers ' Representative
Expense Fund_") to be held in a segregated client account to cover and
reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative for
its obligations in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein. The Sellers shall not receive any interest or earnings on
the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Sellers' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Sellers' Representative shall
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Sellers' Representative Expense
Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Sellers' Representative shall hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, shall not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and shall not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the
completion of the Sellers' Representative's responsibilities, the Sellers'
Representative shall distribute any remaining balance of the Sellers'
Representative Expense Fund to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Share. For Tax purposes, the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund shall be
treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Sellers at
the time of Closing.

have retained Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem, Tal (" _Sellers ' Counsel_") to
act as their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that Sellers' Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that no other party
or Person has the status of a client of the Sellers' Counsel for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The parties hereby agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates and Sellers' Representative or any of its
Affiliates, Sellers' Counsel may represent Sellers' Representative in such
dispute even though the interests of Sellers' Representative may be directly
adverse to Purchaser, any member of the Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates and even though Sellers' Counsel may have represented a
member of the Company Group in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
and Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates hereby waive, on
behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any conflict of interest in
connection with such representation by Sellers' Counsel. Each of the parties
further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing communications among Sellers'
Counsel, any member of the Company Group, and any Seller in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the
Sellers' Representative, and may be controlled by Sellers' Representative and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company Group or any of
their respective Affiliates. Purchaser and the Company agree to take, and to
cause their respective Affiliates to take, all steps reasonably necessary to
implement the intent of this _Section 8.5(f)_.

Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving

provisions contained in the Organizational Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and during such six (6)-year period, such
provision shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each
case, except as required by applicable Law; _provided_ , that there shall be
no obligation of any successor or permitted assign of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend any of its Organizational
Documents to comply with this _Section 8.6(b)_.

expend more than 200% of the annual premium amount currently expended by the
Company for coverage as of the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) If Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the surviving corporation or entity
shall assume all of the obligations of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
set forth in this _Section 8.6_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be
no obligation of any successor or assign to amend its Organizational
Documents.

  


 

  

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 8.6_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 8.6(c)_ (and their
heirs and Representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 8.6(c)_ (and their
heirs and Representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 8.6(c)_ (and their heirs and Representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.6_ , with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 8.6(c)_ (and their heirs and Representatives))
under this _Section 8.6_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights that such persons may have under the Organizational
Documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or applicable Law (whether at Law or in
equity).

  

  

 

70  

  

(f) The Liability of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries under this _Section 8.6_ shall be joint and several.

  


 

  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 8.6_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  


 

  

8.7 _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans
(other than equity incentive arrangements, but, for clarity, without
derogating from any payments due pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ ) in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating, or from causing the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide to each continuing employee of the Company Group, to the extent such
employee was employed immediately prior to the Effective Time and continues to
be employed by the Surviving Corporation (" _Continuing Employee_ "),
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits) to each such employee that, taken as a whole, and subject to such
employee's consent (if such consent is required under applicable law), that
are not less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits
(including allocations to provident funds and education funds) and severance
payments (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) operate all Employee Plans that are cash incentive and other
annual bonus arrangements (other than equity incentive arrangements)
(collectively, " _Bonus Plans_ "), as applicable, for 2017 in accordance with
the terms of such incentive and other annual bonus arrangements; _provided_
that performance goals under such Bonus Plans may be reasonably adjusted by
the Surviving Corporation in good faith to reflect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

71  

  

(d) To the extent that a plan that is comparable to an Employee Plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) cause to be granted to such employee credit for all service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where
length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation and sick
leave accrual and severance pay entitlement but not for accruals under any
defined benefit pension plans) to the extent such credit was recognized by a
comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time or is
required to be recognized by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) unless prohibited by the applicable plan, each such Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time
(other than the employee benefit plans or other compensation arrangements of
the Surviving Corporation) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to
the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such employee participates immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving
Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting
periods, preâ€‘existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and activelyâ€‘atâ€‘work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and the
Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins in the
year of the Closing to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum outâ€‘ofâ€‘pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment or
services for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Company Group employee or service
provider for any reason, (ii) require Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time, (iii) constitute the adoption,
amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan, including the Employee
Plans or (iv) create any third party rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever in any employees of any member of the Company Group (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or any other Person that is not a party
to this Agreement.

  


 

  

(f) Upon the request of Purchaser, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to
make available to Purchaser access to the Continuing Employees, on reasonable
notice and at reasonable times, for the purpose of discussing, in consultation
with the Company's management, post-Closing employment and retention
arrangements between the Company and such Continuing Employees; _provided_ ,
that any failure of such Continuing Employees to engage in such discussions or
to reach any agreement with respect to post-Closing employment and retention
arrangements shall not be deemed a breach of any provision of this Agreement
or a failure of a condition contained herein.

  

  

 

72  

  

8.8 _Tax Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company Group which are required by applicable
Law to be filed after the Closing Date for any taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and for any taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "). Each such Tax Return
(including any such Tax Return in respect of sales and use Taxes in New York
and Maryland (the " _Filing States_ "), but excluding any such Tax Return in
respect of sales and use Taxes in any other state of the United States (the "
_Non-Filing States_ ")) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_
, that all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be claimed as deductions on each
such Tax Return that is an income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. No
later than thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return (other than in
respect of sales and use Taxes in the Non-Filing States), Purchaser shall
submit such Tax Return to the Sellers' Representative for its review, and
shall consider in good faith any reasonable revisions requested by the
Sellers' Representative. Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification for
all Taxes shown due on each such Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
excess of the amount, if any, of such Taxes taken into account in calculating
Working Capital, in accordance with _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ and the terms of
Article 9 (except that the Sellers shall have no Liability under _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ or otherwise relating to or arising from sales and use Taxes
other than sales and use Taxes in the Filing States for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) that includes the Closing Date, which (for the avoidance of
doubt) will be taken into account in calculating the Working Capital or
payable in accordance with this _Section 8.8(a))_.

  


 

  

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser
will not (i) file (except for Tax Returns that are filed pursuant to _Section
8.8(a)_ ) or amend or permit the Company Group to file or amend any Tax Return
relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) with respect to Tax
Returns filed pursuant to _Section 8.8(a)_ , after the date such Tax Returns
are filed pursuant to _Section 8.8(a)_ , amend or permit the Company Group to
amend any such Tax Return, (iii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or
waived, or permit the Company Group to extend or waive, any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) make or change any Tax election or
accounting method that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of
the Company Group, including any election under Section 338 of the Code or
similar election, or (v) initiate any communication with any Governmental
Authority to voluntarily disclose any failure to pay any Tax, file any Tax
Return or otherwise comply with any Tax Laws with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period of the Company Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time
any action described in this _Section 8.8(b)_ is proposed to be taken, no
amounts remain in the Indemnification Escrow Fund or such action relates
solely to sales and use Taxes, Purchaser may take any such action in its sole
direction; _provided_ that Sellers shall have no Liability in respect of any
of the foregoing actions.

  

  

 

73  

  

(c) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax
Returns, (ii) any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes
and Tax Returns, (iii) the preparation of any financial statements to the
extent related to Taxes and (iv) matters relating to any escheat or unclaimed
property Laws. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the
other party's request) the provision, of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;
_provided_ , that the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance;
_provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to provide assistance at
times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the business and
operations of such party.

  


 

  

(d) Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative with notice of any
written inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by the
Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, which relate to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice;
_provided_ that failure to give such notification on a timely basis shall not
affect the indemnification provided in _ARTICLE 9_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Purchaser shall have the right to control any such audit, litigation
or other proceeding at its own expense, provided that (x) the Sellers'
Representative shall have the right to participate in any such matter at the
Sellers' sole expense, (y) Purchaser shall keep the Sellers' Representative
reasonably informed of the status of such matter (including providing the
Sellers' Representative with copies of all written correspondence regarding
such matter), and (z) Purchaser shall not settle any such proceedings without
the Sellers' Representative's written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if at the time of receipt of any such written inquiry, audit, examination or
proposed adjustment, (i) no amounts remain in the Indemnification Escrow Fund
or (ii) such written inquiry, audit, examination or proposed adjustment
relates solely to sales and use Taxes, then in the case of clause (i), the
provisions in (x), (y) and (z) shall not apply and, in the case of clause
(ii), this _Section 8.8(d)_ shall not apply; _provided_ , that Sellers shall
have no Liability in respect of any of the foregoing inquiries, audits,
examinations or proposed adjustments.

  


 

  

(e) The parties hereto agree that, for all income Tax reporting purposes, (i)
Purchaser will be the owner of the Escrow Funds and all income earned thereon
shall, as of the end of each of Purchaser's taxable years be reported as
having been earned by Purchaser, whether or not such income was disbursed
during such calendar year and (ii) the right of Sellers to distributions from
the Escrow Funds shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price
eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any
corresponding provision of state or local Law. Purchaser shall be entitled to
distributions with respect to the calendar quarter ending March 31, June 30,
September 30, and December 31, respectively, from the Escrow Funds in an
amount equal to the product of (x) 15% and (y) the income earned by the Escrow
Funds in the applicable calendar quarter.

  

  

 

74  

  

8.9 _Transfer Taxes; Recording Charges_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other
similar fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne equally by Purchaser and the Sellers when due, and
Purchaser will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if
required by applicable Law, the Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  


 

  

8.10 _280G_. To the extent necessary to avoid the application of Code Section
280G, the Company shall (i) obtain waivers from each Person who has a right to
any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) (such waived amounts, the
" _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining payments and/or benefits
applicable to such Person shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G), and (ii) following the
execution of the waivers described in clause (i), obtain approval by the
Company Stockholders of the Waived 280G Benefits by a vote intended to meet
the requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and the regulations thereunder.
Prior to, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to
soliciting such waivers and approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and approval materials to Purchaser for its reasonable review and the
Company shall reflect in such waivers and approval materials any changes
reasonably requested by Purchaser or its Representatives. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, and no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Purchaser with the
calculations and related documentation required to determine whether the vote
described in this _Section 8.10_ is necessary in order to avoid the imposition
of Taxes under Code Section 4999. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser evidence that a vote of
the Company Stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and
that the requisite number of votes of the Company Stockholders was obtained
with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits.

  


 

  

8.11 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. On or before the Closing Date,
except as set forth on _Section 8.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all
Liabilities between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and one or more of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, including any and all Contracts
(other than this Agreement) between any of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or more of its Affiliates (other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be settled
(in the case of any Indebtedness) or terminated, without any Liability on the
part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, from and after the Closing.

  


 

  

8.12 _Guarantee_. Purchaser Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not as surety, the due and punctual payment
by Purchaser (including any permitted assignee) of its current and future
monetary obligations pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Payments_
"). The foregoing sentence is an absolute, unconditional and continuing
guaranty of the full and punctual discharge of the Guaranteed Payment. Should
Purchaser default in the full and punctual discharge or performance of all or
any portion of the Guaranteed Payment, the obligations of Purchaser Parent
hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to or for the benefit of
the Sellers or (prior to the Closing) to the Company. This provision shall
remain in full force and effect until satisfaction of the Guaranteed Payments
at which time it will terminate.

ARTICLE 9

  


 

  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  


 

  

9.1 _Survival; Escrow Release_.

  


 

  

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties, and covenants of the
parties which require performance on or prior to the Closing Date, set forth
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _ARTICLE 3_ of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of _ARTICLE 9_
and shall terminate on the close of business on the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date (the " _Limitation Date_ "); _provided_ , that
Purchaser's obligations to pay the Final Merger Consideration and the other
amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder and _Section 8.12_ shall survive the
Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that each of the representations
and warranties set forth in (i) _Section 5.1_ (Organization and Power;
Subsidiaries and Investments), _Section 5.2_ (Authorization), _Section 5.3_
(Capitalization), _Section 5.4_ (Absence of Conflicts) and _Section 5.18_
(Brokerage) (collectively, the " _Company Fundamental Representations_ ") and
(ii) clause (a) of _Section 6.1_ (Organization and Power), _Section 6.2_
(Authorization), _Section 6.3_ (Absence of Conflicts) and _Section 6.5_
(Brokerage) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable to such representation (as such statute of
limitations pertains to the subject matter of such representation, or the
ability of Purchaser or any third party to make a claim relating to breach of
such representation, including all periods of extension and/or tolling,
whether automatic or permissive). The Company Fundamental Representations and
the Purchaser Fundamental Representations together shall be referred to herein
as the " _Fundamental Representations_." The covenants of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement which require performance after the Closing shall
survive the Closing indefinitely or in accordance with the period expressly
specified the terms of the relevant covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, any representation and warranty arising out of fraud or willful
misconduct on the part of any party hereto shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect indefinitely.

  


 

  

(b) Within two (2) Business Days after the Limitation Date, Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent (including by delivering
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent) to release to the Payments
Administrator (for further distribution to the Company Stockholders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share) and to the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or the Section 102 Trustee, as applicable (for the further
distribution to the Company Awardholders as of the date of the Closing in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share), an amount equal to the excess of (i)
all remaining amounts in the Indemnification Escrow Fund minus (ii) the
aggregate amount (the " _Claim Amount_ ") for which valid claims for
indemnification were made against the Indemnification Escrow Fund prior to the
Limitation Date in accordance with the provisions of this _Article 9_ and
remain not yet resolved, including the amount of all claims for recovery under
the Timeless APA with concurrent notice to the Sellers' Representative of a
claim under this _Article 9_ and any Losses arising from a Third Party Claim
for which notice was given pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)_ (and in the case of
Losses not yet actually paid or incurred, a reasonable estimate of the amount
thereof determined in good faith by the Purchaser Indemnified Party and based
on information available to the Purchaser Indemnified Party at the time),
which were made prior to the Limitation Date, which remain not resolved and
which could reasonably be expected to be a valid claim for indemnification
against the Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of
this _Article 9_. Furthermore, within two (2) Business Days after it is
determined that all or any portion of the Claim Amount is not owed to
Purchaser hereunder, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall direct
the Escrow Agent (including by delivering joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent) to release to the Payments Administrator (for further
distribution to the Company Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share) and to the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or the Section 102
Trustee, as applicable (for the further distribution to the Company
Awardholders as of the date of the Closing in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share) such portion of the Claim Amount. In the event that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties have a right of recovery under the Timeless APA, the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue such
recovery under the Timeless APA prior to seeking recovery from the Sellers
under this _Article 9_ to the extent any such claim is duplicative of the
claim under the Timeless APA; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties to successfully recover amounts claimed under
the Timeless APA shall not release the Sellers from or otherwise diminish the
Sellers' obligations under the provisions of this _Article 9_.

  

  

 

76  

  

9.2 _Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ , the Sellers shall,
severally (and not jointly) in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Share,
indemnify and defend each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against, and
shall hold each of them harmless from and against, and pay and reimburse each
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses incurred or

as of the date hereof or to be true and correct as of the Closing Date as if
such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except
for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date,
the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date);

  


 

  

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or other agreement or
obligation to be performed on or prior to Closing by the Company or the
Sellers' Representative under this Agreement;

  


 

  

(iii) Taxes of each member of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent such Taxes have been taken into account in
calculating Working Capital, and Losses arising from any failure of any of the
representations or warranties in _Section 5.17_ to be true and correct as of
the date hereof or to be true and correct as of the Closing Date as if such
representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the
inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided
in the last sentence of _Section 8.8(a)_ , this _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall
not apply to any sales or use Taxes of any member of the Company Group and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall have no
Liability under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ , this _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or otherwise
in respect of such sales and use Taxes;

  

  

 

77  

  

(iv) any claim made by any Seller, former stockholder or optionholder or other
Person relating to such Person's rights with respect to the Final Merger
Consideration or the calculations and determinations set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall;

  


 

  

(v) the breach on the part of the Company prior to the Closing, in connection
with the consummation of the Merger, of any provision of the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

  


 

  

(vi) any Sellers' Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness to the extent not taken
into account in determining the Final Merger Consideration or the adjustment
contemplated in _Section 2.11_ , and to the extent not known by Purchaser
prior to the date that Purchaser delivers to the Sellers' Representative the
calculations referred to in _Section 2.11(b)_.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ , Purchaser shall indemnify
and defend each of the Company Indemnified Parties against, and shall hold
each of them harmless from and against, and pay and reimburse each of the
Company Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, the Company Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of,
resulting from, related to or by reason of:

  


 

  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
instrument delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement, as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date as if such
representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the
inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with reference to such
specified date); or

  


 

  

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or other agreement or
obligation to be performed by Purchaser under this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge
acquired, capable of being acquired, or which it is alleged the other party
should have known, at any time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

  

  

 

78  

  

9.3 _Claims against the Indemnification Escrow Amount; Limitations on
Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) (i) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall assert any claim under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ and no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification, where the Loss relating to such claim (or series of similar
claims) is less than $40,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ "), and no claims
shall be aggregated for purposes of this clause (i); (ii) no Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall assert any claim under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification, unless and until the
aggregate amount of all Losses indemnifiable under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceeds
on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $3,300,000 (the " _Basket_ "), and
then Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
to the extent of any such excess subject to the other provisions of this
_ARTICLE 9_ ; (iii) the aggregate Liability in respect of any claims under
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and/or _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall in no event exceed the
amount then remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund (other than, with
respect to such claims, its remedies against the insurer(s) or underwriter(s)
of the Representation and Warranty Policy) and such claims shall be asserted
solely and exclusively against the Indemnification Escrow Fund; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no such claim by any Purchaser Indemnified Party under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ and/or _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall be asserted against, and no
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification from, any of
the Sellers or any other Person (other than the insurer(s) or underwriter(s)
of the Representation and Warranty Policy). The foregoing restrictions in this
_Section 9.3(a)_ shall not apply to (1) claims under clauses (ii), (iv), (v)
and (vi) of _Section 9.2(a)_ or (2) Losses based upon, arising out of,
resulting from, related to or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Company Fundamental Representation; _provided_ , that the aggregate Liability
for Losses based upon, arising out of, resulting from, related to or by reason
of any inaccuracy in or breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or
claims under clauses (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of _Section 9.2(a)_ shall in no
event exceed, with respect to each Seller, its Pro Rata Share of the Final
Merger Consideration actually paid to such Seller (after taking into account
all other claims for indemnification from the Indemnification Escrow Fund made
by Purchaser Indemnified Parties).

  


 

  

(b) Any Losses payable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any
claim under _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund; and (ii) to the extent the Indemnification Escrow
Fund has been exhausted (and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
9.3(a)_ ), from the Sellers severally and not jointly (in accordance with
their Pro Rata Shares).

  


 

  

(c) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants and agreements,
and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be disregarded.

9.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 10.8_ , each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing (except for disputes
under _Section 2.11_ , which disputes will be resolved in accordance with the
dispute mechanism set forth in _Section 2.11_ ), its sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud or
willful misconduct on the part of any party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement and the Schedules attached hereto and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE 9_ and, in the case of Purchaser, its
remedies against the insurer(s) or underwriter(s) of the Representation and
Warranty Policy. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party entitled to
indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any
indemnifying party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") (other than claims arising
from fraud or willful misconduct on the part of any party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the Schedules attached hereto and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether arising under or based
upon any Law or otherwise, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _ARTICLE 9_. Nothing in this _Section 9.4_ shall limit any
Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled in accordance with _Section 10.8_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein is intended to, or shall
limit any Person's rights or remedies on account of any party's fraud or
willful misconduct.

  


 

  

9.5 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or warranty
or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 9.1_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless with respect to Losses shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period as set forth in _Section 9.1_ , previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice (to the extent known at such time stating in reasonable detail
the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this
Agreement.

  


 

  

9.6 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to _Section 9.1_ , a claim or demand made by any Person for any
matter not including a Third Party Claim may be asserted by reasonably prompt
written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (it being
understood that any notice to the Sellers' Representative shall serve as a
notice to any Seller), setting forth in reasonable detail (to the extent known
at such time) the nature of the claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure
to give such prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not
preclude the Indemnified Party from any indemnification which it may claim in
accordance with this _ARTICLE 9_ , except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow
the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter
or circumstance alleged to give rise to the claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the claim and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to the Company's premises and personnel and
the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day
period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

 

80  

  

(b) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure
to give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure; _provided_
_further_ that, for purposes of making claims (or making other deliverable
hereunder), written notice to the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed
written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 9.6(b)_.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, or earlier, to the extent an immediate action is required to be
taken, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.6(c)_ and _Section 9.6(d)_ ,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party, and to exclusively defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the Indemnified Party its
liability for all obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim (subject
to the terms and limitations of Article _9_ ) within fifteen (15) days after
such Indemnified Party's notice of the Third Party Claim has been given to the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , further, however, that in connection with any
claim for indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)_ for which there is a right of recovery by such party under
the Timeless APA, the right to defend such Third Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section 9.6(c)_ shall include pursuing recovery under the Timeless APA. If
the Indemnifying Party complies with the foregoing provision of this _Section
9.6(c)_ and elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder,
it shall within fifteen (15) days of the Indemnified Party's written notice of
the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third
Party Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense
of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to
preserve its rights in this regard.

  


 

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim that relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, or (ii) fails to comply with the terms of
_Section 9.6(c)_ which are required in order to defend a Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with such Third Party Claim on the terms set forth in this _Section 9.6_.
If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall, to the extent that the Losses thereunder are indemnifiable hereunder,
reimburse the Indemnified Party for the fees and expenses of defending such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if based on the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third
Party Claim. The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to the
other to such documents and information as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim.

  

  

 

81  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.6_ to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, admit any Liability, permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment, or settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any Third
Party Claim on a basis that would not include an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities with respect to such claim and would
result in (A) the imposition of an Order that would restrict future activity
or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) a finding or
admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person or
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (C) a finding
or admission that would be materially adverse to other claims made or
threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any Liability, permit a default
or consent to entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise, or offer to settle
or compromise, the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.6_ to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend any Third
Party Claim nor any right to consent to any settlement or compromise of a
Third Party Claim if (I) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction, other
equitable remedies or otherwise involves relief other than monetary damages in
respect of the Indemnified Party or its business, (II) such Third Party Claim
involves as a counterparty, a customer, supplier or other partner of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, the loss of the commercial
relationship with whom would be materially adverse to the Indemnified Party,
(III) such Third Party Claim involves a criminal or regulatory proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation or (IV) such Third Party Claim
involves an investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Authority.

  


 

  

(f) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case, with respect to any
claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnifying Party
notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall pay,
and/or instruct the Escrow Agent to pay on its behalf, as applicable, to the
extent that indemnification is available for such amounts pursuant to this
Agreement, all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the Indemnified
Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
as applicable.

  

  

 

82  

  

(g) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 9.6_ , on the one
hand, and _Section 8.8_ , on the other hand, _Section 8.8_ shall control as to
Tax matters.

  


 

  

9.7 _No Circular Recovery_. The Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, hereby agrees that if any payment is required to be made pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ , the Sellers shall have no rights against the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates, Representatives, assigns or successors, whether
by reason of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement or otherwise, in respect
of any such payments or Liabilities, and shall not take any action against the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates, Representatives, assigns or
successors with respect thereto. For clarification, nothing in this _Section
9.7_ shall limit the right of any Seller to indemnification resulting from the
fact that such Seller was an employee, consultant, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any acts or omissions that
occurred prior to the Closing (other than any claim for indemnification to
recover Losses incurred as a result of any claim for indemnification by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ ).

  


 

  

9.8 _Certain Additional Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) The amount of any and all Losses under this _ARTICLE 9_ shall be
determined (i) net of any amounts actually recovered by an Indemnified Party
or any of such Indemnified Party's Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or contract pursuant to which or under which such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnified Party's Affiliates is a party or has rights (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Representation and Warranty Policy, but only from and
after such time as the retention thereunder has been fully eroded) net of the
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in making
such recovery, including any premium increases under insurance policies
(collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), (ii) net of the amount of any
Tax refunds of estimated Taxes paid in respect of the taxable period or
portion thereof ending on the Closing Date or (in lieu of such refunds)
credits against Taxes payable that are actually received by the Company Group
at or after Closing, and (iii) net of any Tax benefits actually realized in
the year in which the Loss was incurred. Purchaser shall have no right to
assert any claims, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification,
with respect to any Losses that would have been covered by an Alternative
Arrangement had Purchaser maintained for its benefit and the benefit of the
Company Group the same rights or coverage under an Alternative Arrangement
following the Closing that was in effect for the Company Group immediately
prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a
claim pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ for any amounts in respect of, and in no
event shall "Losses" be deemed to include, (i) consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages (other than any consequential, special or
indirect damages to the extent reasonably foreseeable to result from a breach
of this Agreement or an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth
in this Agreement) except to the extent such damages (1) are required to be
paid to a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or (2) involve a party's
fraud or willful misconduct or (ii) in the case of Purchaser, any Loss to the
extent included as a Liability or expense on the Financial Statements or to
the extent included in the calculation of Final Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

83  

  

(c) Purchaser shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement
from and against any Losses or Taxes of any Person that are due to the
unavailability in any taxable period (or portion hereof) beginning after the
Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from
a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(d) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

  


 

  

(e) Each Indemnified Party agrees that in the event of any breach giving rise
to an indemnification obligation under this _ARTICLE 9_ , such Indemnified
Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party (including the Sellers' Representative) if so requested by
the Indemnifying Party (or the Sellers' Representative), in order to take, all
reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the related breach
(including taking steps to prevent any contingent Liability from becoming an
actual Liability).

  


 

  

(f) Except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 9.8(f)_ , to the
extent permitted by the relevant insurance policies, each Indemnified Party
hereby waives any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to
any indemnifiable Losses. After any indemnification payment is made to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ , the Indemnifying Party shall,
to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the
Indemnified Party against any third party (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, the insurer(s) or underwriter(s) of the Representation and Warranty
Policy) in connection with the Losses to which such payment relates. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any Indemnified Party
receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
execute, upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party, any instrument
reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation rights. The insurer(s) or
underwriter(s) under the Representation and Warranty Policy shall have no
right of subrogation against any Seller, except in the event of fraud or
willful misconduct of such Seller, in which case no such subrogation rights
shall be deemed to violate _Section 10.3_ hereof.

10.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of Purchaser and the Company,
or, if following the Closing, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative, any
attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be void;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving

their respective rights or obligations hereunder (including Purchaser, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation's rights to seek indemnification hereunder)
to any Affiliate of Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, but no
such assignment shall relieve Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation of any Liability hereunder.

  


 

  

10.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each term and provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any term or provision of this Agreement is held
to be prohibited by, invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law,
such term or provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such term or
provision or the remaining terms or provisions of this Agreement. Upon
determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  


 

  

10.5 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and the parties intend that no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any Person. The use of the words " _includes_ " or "
_including_ " in this Agreement or in any of the agreements contemplated
hereby shall be by way of example rather than by limitation. Unless the
context otherwise requires, any reference to a " _Section,_ " " _Exhibit,_ "
or " _Schedule_ " shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement,
exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The
words " _hereof,_ " " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement
to $ shall mean U.S. dollars. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day. The Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits referred to herein shall be
construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

  

  

 

86  

  

10.6 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement (including as set forth in _Section 8.6_ above), nothing
herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon
or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
rights of each party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are unique and agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would be an inadequate remedy for any such non-performance or
breach. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall
have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their
favor at Law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's
obligations hereunder and the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chosen Courts, without proof of damages or otherwise not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.9 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule
and Exhibits) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the sole and
entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior
and contemporaneous understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the parties, both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof in any way.

  


 

  

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which may be by portable document format (.pdf), by
electronic means (including docusign or the like) or facsimile, and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A signed
copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of
electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as
delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

  

  

 

87  

  

10.11 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
personal jurisdiction of any state court sitting in the State of Delaware or
United States federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware (the " _Chosen
Courts_ "), over any suit, action or other proceeding brought by any party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to
any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. In the event of any litigation
regarding or arising from this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable expenses,
attorneys' fees and costs incurred therein or in enforcement or collection of
any judgment or award rendered therein.

  


 

  

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  


 

  

EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
