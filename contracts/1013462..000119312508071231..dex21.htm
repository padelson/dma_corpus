Exhibits

 |  | 
  Exhibit A |  | Form of Voting Agreement AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March 31,
2008, by and among ANSYS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Evgeni,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer (" _Merger
Sub_ "), Sidney LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Merger LLC_ "), and Ansoft Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ ").

WHEREAS, Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and Seller intend to effect a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into Seller in accordance with this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), with Seller to be the surviving corporation of the Merger, which
Merger will be followed immediately by a merger of the Surviving Corporation
(as defined below) with and into Merger LLC (the " _Upstream Merger_ "), with
the Merger LLC to be the surviving entity in the Upstream Merger (the "
_Surviving Entity_ "). It is intended that the Merger be mutually
interdependent with and a condition precedent to the Upstream Merger and that
the Upstream Merger shall, through the binding commitment evidenced by this
Agreement, be effected immediately following the Effective Time (as defined
below) without further approval, authorization or direction from or by any of
the parties hereto.

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Merger Sub, Seller and
the managing member of Merger LLC have declared that it is advisable and in
the best respective interests of Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and Seller and
their respective stockholders or sole member, as applicable, to consummate,
and have approved this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein,
pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Merger and the Upstream Merger shall occur.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as an
inducement to Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC to enter into this Agreement,
Buyer and certain stockholders have entered into voting agreements, dated as
of the date hereof, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each a "
_Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant
to which such stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote
or cause to be voted, at Sellers Stockholder Meeting (as defined below) all
of the shares of the Seller Common Stock (as defined below) beneficially owned
by such stockholder in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement.

WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered
together as a single integrated transaction, will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ").

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties, and agreements contained herein, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I - THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Seller. Seller
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

1.2  _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, which shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or before the Closing
Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger
becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger. Immediately after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Upstream Merger
to become effective by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary of
State of Delaware (the " _Upstream Merger Certificate_ "), in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the LLC Act. The " _Upstream Merger
Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Upstream Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Upstream Merger Certificate.

1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of
Goodwin Procter LLP, Exchange Place, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver
(subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth
in Article VII (other than those conditions that relate to action to be taken
at the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of such conditions at the
Closing), unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to
its terms or unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the appropriate
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to
all of the restrictions, disabilities, and duties of Seller and Merger Sub,
as provided under Section 259 of the DGCL. At and after the Upstream Merger
Effective Time, the Upstream Merger shall have the effects set forth in this

rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and be subject to all of the
restrictions, disabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation and Merger
LLC, as provided in the DGCL and the LLC Act and all of the rights and
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement shall be deemed

indemnification provided for in Section 6.7 hereof), except the name of Seller
as the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be Ansoft Corporation and the

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided and in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Surviving Corporation
Charter_ "). From and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Seller (the "
_Seller Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,

indemnification provided for in Section 6.7 hereof), and as so amended shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as
provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Surviving
Corporation Bylaws_ ").

(b) At the Upstream Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Upstream Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger LLC or the
Surviving Corporation, the Certificate of Formation of Merger LLC, as in
effect immediately prior to the Upstream Merger Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in
accordance with the LLC Act, except the name of the Surviving Entity shall be

after the Upstream Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Upstream Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger LLC or the Surviving Corporation,

Company Agreement of the Surviving Entity, except the name of the Surviving
Entity shall be Sidney LLC (the " _Surviving Entity Limited Liability Company
Agreement_ ").

1.6  _Directors and Officers_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately

in accordance with the Surviving Entity Certificate of Formation and the
Surviving Entity Limited Liability Company Agreement.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of Seller at the Effective

Company Agreement.

ARTICLE II - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SELLER CAPITAL STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any party hereto or of the holder
of any shares of the capital stock of Seller or capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of Merger
Sub, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of Seller (" _Seller Common Stock_ ") that are owned by
Seller or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Seller and any shares of Seller
Common Stock owned by Buyer, Merger Sub, or any other wholly owned Subsidiary
of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share
of Seller Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, subject
to adjustment as provided for in Section 8.1(c): (i) $16.25 per share in cash
without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii) 0.431882 shares
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Buyer (the " _Buyer Common Stock_ ") (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Merger Consideration_." As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Seller Common Stock, when converted as provided in this Section 2.1(c), shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each a " _Certificate_ " and
collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") or a book-entry share (each a " _Book-
Entry Share_ " and collectively, the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing
any such shares of Seller Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under
this Article II upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the
case may be, in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest or dividends.

(d) _Seller Stock Options and Related Matters_.

(i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Seller (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Seller Stock Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or use its reasonable
best effort to take such other actions as are required to provide for the
conversion of each Seller Stock Option as provided in this Section 2.1(d).



 

4 (ii) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Assumed Options_ "),
whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an option to
purchase Buyer Common Stock as provided below in this Section 2.1(d)(ii), and
Buyer shall assume such Seller Stock Option in accordance with this Section
2.1(d)(ii) and the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of
the Seller Stock Option Plans and/or the seller option agreement by which such
Option is evidenced. All rights to purchase Seller Common Stock under Assumed
Options shall, effective as of the Effective Time, thereupon be converted into
rights to purchase Buyer Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Option may be exercised solely for Buyer
Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to each
Assumed Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Seller Common Stock that were subject to such Assumed Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of Buyer Common Stock; (C)
the per share exercise price for the Buyer Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be determined by dividing the per
share exercise price of Seller Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole
cent; and (D) after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting of any
Assumed Option that will occur as a result of the Merger pursuant to the terms
of any such Assumed Option, any remaining restriction on the exercise of any
Assumed Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, remaining vesting schedule and other provisions of such
Assumed Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the conversion
of such Assumed Option. Buyer shall file with the SEC, no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Closing, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), if available for use by Seller, relating to the Buyer Shares
issuable with respect to the Assumed Options. " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " is
the quotient of (x) $16.25, plus (A) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (B) the
average of the closing prices of Buyer Common Stock for the thirty (30)
trading days ending one (1) day prior to the Closing, divided by (y) the
average of the closing prices of Buyer Common Stock for the thirty (30)
trading days ending one (1) day prior to the Closing, rounded to the nearest
one-hundred thousandth of a cent, with $.000005 rounded down.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Assumed Options plus the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in respect of shares of
Seller Common Stock in the Merger (the " _Total Shares_ ") exceeds twenty
percent (20%) of the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock outstanding prior
to the Merger, the number of Assumed Options shall be reduced to an amount
such that the Total Shares is less than 20% of the number of shares  



 

5  of Buyer Common Stock outstanding prior to the Merger. Any Options that are
not Assumed Options by operation of this subparagraph shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu of being assumed by Buyer, an amount of cash equal to
$32.50, minus the exercise price of such Option not assumed. Only Options that
are vested and permitted to receive such cash payment pursuant to the
applicable Seller Stock Option Plan shall be eligible to receive such cash
payment. The Options to receive such cash payment shall be allocated amongst
the holders thereof pro rata based on the number of Options eligible to
receive the cash payment held by each. 

2.2 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay to each holder of a fractional share
of Buyer Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the average of the last sale prices of Buyer Common
Stock, as reported on Nasdaq, for the five (5) trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

2.3 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. At or before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the
holders of Seller Common Stock, (i) Buyer shall cause to be delivered to the
Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates
representing the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Article II (" _New Certificates_ "), and (ii) Buyer shall deliver, or shall
cause to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
Article II (including the estimated amount of cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock) (such cash and New Certificates,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Buyer shall
promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds with the
Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
funds required to make such payments. The Exchange Agent shall make payments
of the aggregate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance
with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, and provided that Seller has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to
the Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent
to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share
or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, who has not previously surrendered
such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry Shares, as
the case may be, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Seller Common Stock represented
by such Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be,
shall have been converted pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement.



 

6 Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of Seller
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a
check representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former holder
of Seller Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement,
and/or (iii) a check representing the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to which such former holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the
case may be, surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, representing shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, and any unpaid
dividends and distributions thereon as provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section 2.3. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash constituting
Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) or any
such unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be.

(c) _Dividends or Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, in accordance with this
Section 2.3. After the surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, in accordance with this Section 2.3, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable.

(d) _Lost Certificates_. The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be,
shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a New Certificate or
New Certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock to which a holder
of Seller Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger
until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Share or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, representing the shares of
Seller Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.3, or, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an
amount as may be required in each case by Buyer. If any New Certificates
evidencing shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than
that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the case may be,
evidencing Seller Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate
from the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate for shares of Buyer Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 



 

7 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration (including any payments paid pursuant to Section 2.2) delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Seller Common Stock, and from and
after the Effective Time the stock transfer books of Seller shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the
case may be, are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration for each share of Seller Common Stock formerly represented by
such certificate.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
the case may be, nine (9) months after the Effective Time (as well as any
interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the
Exchange Agent to Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or
a Book-Entry Share, as the case may be, who has not previously complied with
this Article II prior to the end of such nine (9) month period shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of its claim for the Merger
Consideration. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as the case
may be, are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to
the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, the
unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any
other applicable Law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in
its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder
of shares of Seller Common Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as the case may be, for any consideration paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar laws. Buyer and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
Seller to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of any shares of Seller Common Stock represented by any Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to
any claims thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments shall be placed in the Exchange Fund and be payable to the
Surviving Corporation.



 

8 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a
Certificate, a Book-Entry Share or Seller Stock Option, as the case may be,
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable provision of
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation,
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted, withheld and paid
over amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Seller Stock
Option, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

(i) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event Buyer or Seller changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the
exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock or Seller Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction
with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock or Seller Common Stock and
the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange
Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration shall be proportionately and appropriately
adjusted; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment
shall be made with regard to the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues
additional shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such
shares in a bona fide third party transaction, or (ii) Buyer issues employee
or director stock grants or similar equity awards. 

2.4 _Appraisal Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") of the Seller Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by Seller Stockholders who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Appraisal Rights Provisions_ "), (i) have not voted in favor of adopting this
Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares, (iii) have otherwise complied in all respects with the Appraisal
Rights Provisions, and (iv) have not effectively withdrawn, lost, or failed to
perfect their rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), will
not be converted into Merger Consideration, but at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to
receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Seller Common Stock held by Seller
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Seller
Common Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed
to have been cancelled and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time,
into the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration.



 

9 (b) Seller shall give Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC prompt notice of any
demands received by Seller for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect
to shares of Seller Common Stock and Buyer shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Seller shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands.

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement to Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC (the "
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), which shall identify any exceptions to the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement (with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection to which such
information relates; _provided_ that an item disclosed in any Section or
subsection shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section or

corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in

reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Seller
Charter and the Seller Bylaws, copies of which have previously been made
available to Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, are true, correct, and
complete copies of such documents as currently in effect.

(b) Each of Sellers Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity, validly

standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and (assuming due
authorization, execution, and delivery by Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC)

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws
relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity.

3.4 _No Violation; Required Filings and Consents_. Assuming the adoption and
approval of this Agreement by the Seller Stockholders and except (a) for

Merger and the Upstream Merger Certificate, and (c) as otherwise set forth in
Section 3.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution,

(a) Seller has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed

furnished since May 1, 2004 and those filed or furnished subsequent to the
date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the " _Seller SEC Reports_ "),
except where the failure to so file or furnish would not, individually or in

of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Seller SEC

regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Seller SEC Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the

has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the rules

engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or former
attorney representing Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence
of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or
similar violation by Seller or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of Seller or any committee thereof or to any

no event or omission has occurred which would cause any Employee Program to
lose its qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the relevant
requirements to provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable Code
Section (including without limitation Code Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and
501(c)(9)). Each asset held under any such Employee Program may be liquidated

Employee Program.

any Employee Program ever maintained by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, there
has been no (i) "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Code Section 4975, (ii) failure to comply with any provision of ERISA,
other applicable Law, or any agreement, or (iii) non-deductible contribution,

ERISA Affiliate to material liability either directly or indirectly
(including, without limitation, through any obligation of indemnification or
contribution) for any damages, penalties, or taxes, or any other loss or
expense. No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding (or
investigation) or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine
claims for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
with respect to any such Employee Program. All payments and/or contributions
required to have been made (under the provisions of any agreements or other
governing documents or applicable Law) with respect to all Employee Programs
ever maintained by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, for all periods prior to the
Closing Date, either have been made or have been accrued.

(d) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has within the past six years
maintained an Employee Program subject to Title IV of ERISA, including
a Multiemployer Plan. None of the Employee Programs has ever provided health
care or any other non-pension benefits to any employees after their employment
is terminated (other than as required by part 6 of subtitle B of title I
of ERISA or state continuation laws) or has ever promised to provide such
post-termination benefits.

any state or federal agency within the last three years with respect to such
Employee Program.

(f) Each Employee Program required to be listed on Schedule 3.12(a) of the

(h) Except with respect to the agreements disclosed in Section 3.12(h) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any written (i) agreement with any stockholders, director, or

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing any
guaranteed period of employment or compensation guarantee, or (C)
providing severance benefits after the termination of employment of such
director or employee; or (ii) agreement or plan binding Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan,
restricted stock plan, stock purchase plan, or severance benefit plan, any of
the benefits of which shall be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of
which shall be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
shall be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering
any individual that, by itself or collectively, would give rise to any
parachute payment subject to Section 280G of the Code, nor has Seller made any
such payment, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
shall not obligate Seller or any other entity to make any parachute payment
subject to Section 280G of the Code.



 

20 (i) Each Employee Program that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated in material
compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a
good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code, the
regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. No stock option granted
under any Seller Stock Option Plan has any exercise price that was or may be
less than the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date the

OF BUYER, MERGER SUB AND MERGER LLC

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement to Seller (the " _Buyer Disclosure Schedule_
"), which shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement (with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection to which such information relates; _provided_
that an item disclosed in any Section or subsection shall be deemed to have
been disclosed for each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the
extent the relevance is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure),
Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Seller as follows: 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

(a) Buyer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good
corporate standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing, and in good corporate
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Merger LLC is a limited
liability company, duly formed, validly existing and in good corporate
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, or
operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in corporate good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned, leased, or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified and in corporate good standing would not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Buyer and Merger Sub
and the Certificate of Formation of Merger LLC, copies of which have
previously been made available to Seller, are true, correct, and complete
copies of such documents as currently in effect.

(c) Each of Merger Sub and Merger LLC was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub, which consists of 100
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, is validly issued, fully paid, and non-
assessable and is owned, beneficially and of record, by Buyer, free and clear
of any claim, lien, Encumbrance, or agreement with respect thereto. Except for
obligations and liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub has not, and will
not have, incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or

4.2 _Capitalization_. As of the close of business on March 18, 2008, the
authorized capital stock of Buyer consists solely of 150,000,000 shares of
Buyer Common Stock, of which 78,360,875 shares are issued and outstanding, and
no shares were held, directly or indirectly, by Buyer as treasury stock; and
2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Buyer
Preferred Stock_ "), none of which is issued and outstanding. At the close of
business on



 

31 March 18, 2008, there were 7,351,165 shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to
outstanding Buyer Stock Options, subject to adjustment on the terms set forth
in the Buyer Stock Option Plans. Buyer has no shares of Buyer Common Stock or
Buyer Preferred Stock reserved for issuance other than as described above. The
outstanding shares of Buyers capital stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and subject to no preemptive rights or
similar rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights). Except for the Buyer Stock Option Plans or as reflected in Section
4.2(a) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer does not have and is not bound
by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments,
rights agreements, or agreements of any character calling for Buyer to issue,
deliver, or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered, or sold any shares of
Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock or any other equity security of
Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer or any securities convertible into,
exchangeable for, or representing the right to subscribe for, purchase, or
otherwise receive any shares of Buyer Common Stock or Buyer Preferred Stock or
any other equity security of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer or obligating
Buyer or any such Subsidiary to grant, extend, or enter into any such
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments, rights agreements, or
any other similar agreements. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of Buyer to repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, Buyer or to provide funds to, or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution, or otherwise)
in, any Subsidiary of Buyer. There are no outstanding contractual obligations
of Buyer pursuant to which Buyer is required to register shares of Buyer
Common Stock or other securities under the Securities Act, except such
contractual obligations entered into after the date hereof as permitted by
Section 5.2. The shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger have
been duly and validly reserved for issuance, and when issued in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully
paid, and nonassessable and free of any preemptive or similar rights.

good faith that participation of Seller or Sellers



 

46 counsel would not be advisable, Buyer meeting with such Governmental Authority
may proceed without the participation of Seller or its counsel; and (iii)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) drafted by
or in conjunction with outside counsel between it and its Affiliates and its
respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of such Governmental Authoritys staff on the other hand, concerning
the review, clearance or approval of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby under the HSR Act or any similar applicable foreign Law, except to the
extent prohibited by applicable Law (including Regulations, codes, plans,
Orders and charges thereunder) or the instructions of such Governmental
Authority. 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) Buyer shall pay the filing and related fees in connection with any such
filings that must be paid to any Governmental Authorities by any of the
parties.

(f) Each of Seller and Buyer shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents required in connection with the Merger and the Upstream
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or (iii)
required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably likely to
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect prior
to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither Seller nor
Buyer shall be required to make any payments in connection with the
fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.3.

6.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions; Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Seller agrees that, except as permitted by this Section 6.4, neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt by any Person to
make an Acquisition Proposal.



 

47 (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, after any
officer or director of Seller receives any Acquisition Proposal, Seller shall
provide Buyer with oral and written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including (i) the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry, (ii) a copy of all written materials provided by such Person in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii) a
written summary, if it is not in writing, of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, Seller shall continue to keep Buyer promptly informed of all material
developments regarding the status and material details of any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, but not limited to,
notice of all material amendments with respect thereto) and to the extent
requested by Buyer, Seller will provide Buyer with daily updates on the status
and details of any such Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall provide Buyer with
48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the
members of Board of Directors of Seller) of any meeting of the Board of
Directors of Seller at which such Board of Directors of Seller is reasonably
expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal or any Change of Recommendation.

(c) If, prior to the time Seller Stockholders Approval is obtained, Seller
receives from a Person a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, Seller may
(A) provide information in response to a request therefor by such Person if
Seller receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable in any material respect
to such Person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that,
contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to such
Person, Seller furnishes to Buyer all such non-public information not
previously provided or made available to Buyer or (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, if
prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the Board of
Directors of Seller, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, determines in good faith that the failure to take
any action described in clause (A) or (B) above would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, and the Board of Directors of
Seller believes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal in respect
of which such action is to be taken, if consummated, is or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(d) The Board of Directors of Seller and each committee thereof shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or make any statement with
the substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, amending qualifying or
modifying), in a manner adverse to Buyer (any such action, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), the Seller Recommendation unless the Board of Directors
of Seller is entitled to take the actions specified under Section 6.4(e);

(ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) an
Acquisition Proposal unless the Board of Directors has made a Change of
Recommendation; or



 

48 (iii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.1(d), cause or permit Seller to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance
with Section 6.4(c)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the receipt of the Seller Stockholders Approval, the Board of
Directors of Seller may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not
result from a breach by Seller of this Section 6.4, effect a Change of
Recommendation or approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal if the Board
of Directors of Seller determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, but only on or after the fifth
(5th) Business Day following Buyers receipt of written notice advising Buyer
that the Board of Directors of Seller desires to effect a Change of
Recommendation due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including any
material changes) and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal.
Such five (5) Business Day period shall be required for each and every
Superior Proposal or material modification thereto, as applicable.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to prohibit Seller
or its Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure obligations
under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Seller Recommendation in any
respect, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and
Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section
8.1(c).

(g) Seller agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Seller agrees
that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 6.4 and in the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to
the premerger exchange of information, Seller, shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
and other Representatives of Buyer, reasonable access without undue
interruption, during normal business hours during the period from the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, to all of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, and records (other than confidential
information contained in personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such
information is prohibited by privacy laws). Upon reasonable prior notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the premerger exchange of information
and the last sentence of this Section 6.5(a), Seller also shall provide Buyer
during normal business hours with reasonable access to Sellers executive
officers, customers, suppliers or key Seller Employees. Neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would contravene any Law
or binding



 

49 agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, would reasonably
be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-
client or work product privilege or would violate or prejudice the rights of
third parties. The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not, without the consent of Seller (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), contact any customers, suppliers
or key Seller Employees.

(b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other party
or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply with,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.5, Seller shall not be
obligated, and shall not be obligated to cause any of its Subsidiaries, to
afford to Buyer or its Representatives any access to any of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments, and records relating to, or in respect of,
competitively sensitive information, the sharing of which would violate
applicable Laws relating to the premerger exchange of information.

6.6 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.

(a) _Benefits_. During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement
and ending at the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to consult with Seller in good
faith with respect to employee transition matters, including the compensation
and employee benefits to be provided to Seller Employees (defined below)
after the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the employees of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the
Effective Time (the " _Seller Employees_ ") will be entitled to participate
in either (i) the Employee Programs (other than equity-based plans) on the
same terms, or terms which in the aggregate provide substantially comparable
benefits, as those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the
employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries on the same terms as
similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries or (iii) a
combination of (i) and (ii), and in each case in the discretion of Buyer, and
Buyer may terminate any of the Employee Programs or merge any of the Employee
Programs with Buyers employee benefit plans as Buyer deems appropriate.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and unless such recognition of
service would result in a duplication of benefits, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit
plans to treat, the service of Seller Employees with Seller or its
Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service
rendered to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation for all purposes, including,
but not limited to, eligibility to participate, vesting, including, but not
limited to, applicability of any minimum waiting periods for participation,
excluding for these purposes benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, treat any Seller Employee as a "new" employee for purposes
of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation for a pre-existing medical condition, except to the extent such
exclusions were applicable under an Employee Program of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _"At Will" Employment_. Except with respect to employees who have entered
into employment agreements with Seller or its Subsidiaries, and subject to
Section 6.6(c)



 

50 hereof, the Seller Employees who remain employed after the Effective Time
shall be considered to be employed by Buyer "at will" and nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of any such Seller Employee at any
time.

(c) _Continuation of Employment_. No provision of this Section 6.6 shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or any Subsidiary
of Seller in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of Buyers Subsidiaries and no
provision of this Section 6.6 shall create such rights in any such persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any employee program or any plan or arrangement that may be established by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the
Effective Time any such plans or arrangements of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries.

6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC agree that all rights to indemnification
or exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the
personal liability of each present and former director, officer, employee,
fiduciary, or agent of Seller and its Subsidiaries provided for in the
respective organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof, shall
continue be honored and in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such claim. The Surviving Entity
Limited Liability Company Agreement will contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of expenses that
are at least as favorable as those currently in the Seller Charter and Seller
Bylaws and during such six (6) year period following the Effective Time, Buyer
shall not and shall cause the Surviving Entity not to amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior
to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent
of Seller and its Subsidiaries in respect of actions or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is
required by Law. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of Seller and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in any
written indemnification agreements between Seller and/or one or more
its Subsidiaries and such officers and directors and listed in Section 6.7 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy (which by its terms shall
survive the Merger and the Upstream Merger) for its directors and officers,
which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6)
years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage
under, and have other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to, the
insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by Seller, so long as the aggregate cost is
$210,000 or less. In the event that $210,000 is insufficient



 

51 for such coverage, Seller may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser
coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
6.7 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.7 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

(d) In the event Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, in case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities, and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger,
the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall use its or their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by, and at the sole expense of, Buyer.

6.9 _Publicity_. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 6.4, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall, or shall permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to,
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. Upon the execution of this
Agreement and at the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall issue a mutually agreed
upon press release announcing the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.10 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of Seller and Buyer will give
prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any litigation relating to, involving or
otherwise affecting Seller, Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that relates to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall give prompt written
notice to Buyer of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement

 



 

52 becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure of
Seller to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in any case, if and only to the extent that such untruth or
inaccuracy or such failure could reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. Buyer shall give prompt written notice to Seller of any
representation or warranty made by it, Merger Sub or Merger LLC contained in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any
failure of Buyer, Merger Sub or Merger LLC to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any case, if and only to the extent
that such untruth or inaccuracy or such failure could reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b)
to fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

6.11 _Shares Listed_. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall obtain approval
for listing on Nasdaq the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to the
holders of the Seller Common Stock in the Merger.

6.12 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Seller Common Stock from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Seller
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing
Date.

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any anti-takeover, control share acquisition,
fair price, moratorium or other similar statute is or may become applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Buyer and Seller and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary to ensure that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute and any regulations
promulgated thereunder on such transactions.

6.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller and Buyer, as
applicable, shall approve in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January 12, 1999) any disposition of equity
securities of Seller (including derivative securities), in the case of Seller,
and any acquisition of equity securities of Buyer (including derivative
securities), in the case of Buyer, resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer and director of Seller who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

  

 

53 6.15 _Other Actions by the Parties_. Buyer and Seller, at the request of the
other party, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and
perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or desirable
for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all action reasonably necessary
to seek and obtain any and all approvals of any Governmental Authority or
other Person required in connection with the Merger or the Upstream Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor (unless approved and so
directed by Buyer in advance) Seller shall be obligated to make or consent to
any divestiture or operational limitation or activity in connection therewith,
or any waiver or modification of any right, or any payment of money or grant
of any other commercial concession as a condition to obtaining any such
approval). Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, where the
satisfaction of such conditions depends on action or forbearance from action
by such party.

6.16 _Financing_.

(a) Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and close the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as soon as commercially
reasonable but in any event at or prior to the Closing. In the event that
financing pursuant to the Commitment Letters is not available to Buyer for any
reason, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and close an
alternative financing in an amount sufficient to deliver the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyers
failure to obtain such financing shall not relieve Buyer, Merger Sub and
Merger LLC of any of their obligations under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger. Buyer will furnish correct and complete copies of drafts of the
definitive agreements relating to the financing to the Seller upon receipt
thereof and will furnish correct and complete copies when executed.

(b) At the Sellers request, Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed with
respect to all material activity concerning the status of the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer
agrees to notify Seller promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business
Day, if at any time prior to the Closing Date the Commitment Letters shall
expire or be terminated for any reason.

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Seller agrees to
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to provide,
such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
the arrangement of, and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, its
financing (and any substitutions, replacements or refinancing thereof),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and
employees to be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice,
to meet with prospective lenders and due diligence sessions each conducted at
the expense of Buyer, and (ii) assist with the preparation of disclosure
documents in connection therewith, provided that Seller shall not
be obligated to incur any liability to any third party on account thereof and
any such assistance shall be at the expense of Buyer.

6.17  _Reorganization_. Neither Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer, Merger
Sub or Merger LLC, on the other hand, shall take or cause to be taken any
action that would prevent the



 

54 Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated
transaction, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. In the event that the condition in Section 7.3(d)
cannot be satisfied because of a failure, as a result of Dissenting Shares
and/or cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, of the consideration set forth
in Section 2.1(c) to meet the continuity of interest requirement under Section
368(a) of the Code (the " _Continuity Requirement_ "), the Stock Consideration
shall be increased and the Cash Consideration shall be decreased to the
minimum extent necessary, based on the Exchange Ratio, to enable the
Continuity Requirement to be met.

6.18 _Tax Due Diligence_. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall promptly deliver
to Buyer or its Tax advisors such documents and other materials relating to
Tax matters which are reasonably requested by such Person(s) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
documents and materials may include, but not be limited to, correct and
complete copies of Tax Returns for any open Tax years filed by Seller and its
Subsidiaries, private letter rulings, determination letters, closing
agreements and other correspondence issued by any Taxing Authority to Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.19 _Director_. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Buyer shall in accordance with provisions contained in Buyers
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, take such action as necessary to (a)
increase the size of the Board of Directors of Buyer by one (1) and (b) elect
Zoltan Cendes or a replacement named by the Seller; _provided_ that such
nominee or any named replacement shall meet the criteria provided in Buyers
Corporate Governance Guidelines, as the same may be amended from time to time
(such nominee or replacement, the " _Designee_ ") as a Class II Director of
the Board of Directors of Buyer to hold office in accordance with Buyers
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and until his successor is duly
elected or qualified, or his earlier death, resignation or removal. The
Designee will be subject to Buyers Statement of Company Policy on Insider
Trading and Disclosure and Insider Trading Procedures and shall execute an
acknowledgement to such effect upon the election of the Designee to the Board
of Directors of Buyer. In addition, the Designee shall acknowledge Buyers
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

Seller contained in this Agreement (i) shall have been true and correct

becomes or is made known to Seller, Seller agrees to adjust the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 8.1(c) in a manner that compensates
Buyer for the financial loss, if any, resulting therefrom, or (2) the
aggregate amount of Merger Consideration and fees payable in connection with
the Merger is less than the amount that would be payable had such
representations and warranties been true and correct.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Seller_. Seller shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC shall have received a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or

(c) _No Seller Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement,
there shall not have been a Seller Material Adverse Effect that has occurred

connection with the Merger.

7.3 _Conditions to the Obligations of Seller_. The obligation of Seller to
effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction (or waiver in writing
if permissible under applicable Law), at or prior to the Effective Time, of
the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. Each representation and warranty of
Buyer, Merger Sub or Merger LLC contained in this Agreement (i) shall have
been true and correct (without regard to any qualification or exception
relating to materiality or Buyer Material Adverse Effect) as of the date of
this Agreement except as, individually or in the aggregate, does not
constitute a Seller Material Adverse Effect and (ii) shall be true and correct
(without regard to any qualification or exception relating to materiality or
Buyer Material Adverse Effect) on and as of the Closing Date with the same
force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date except as,
individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect as of the Closing Date; provided, however, Buyers representations and
warranties which address matters only as of a particular date, need only be
true and correct as of such particular date (subject to the qualifications
regarding Buyer Material Adverse Effect in the preceding clause), it being
understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties, any update of or modification to the Seller
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the execution
of this Agreement shall be disregarded.

Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to

Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, dated as of the Effective Time
and to the effect that the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together
as a single integrated transaction, will qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; provided, however, if Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, does not render such
opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed satisfied if Goodwin
Procter LLP renders such opinion to Seller. The issuance of such opinion shall
be conditioned upon the receipt by such counsel of customary representation
letters from each of Buyer, Merger Sub, and Merger LLC, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such counsel. Each such representation letter shall be dated
on or before the date of such opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or
modified in any material respect.

ARTICLE VIII - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)

termination right under this Section 8.1(b);



 

58 (c) by Buyer, if: (i) the Board of Directors of Seller shall have made a

as a result of any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.2 (Capitalization) or 3.5 (Brokers Fees), such breach shall be
deemed cured if Seller adjusts the Merger Consideration (such adjustment made
by proportionally adjusting both the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration) such that the aggregate Merger Consideration and fees payable
after giving effect to such adjustment equals the amount that would have been
payable had such breach not occurred (it being agreed and understood that upon

consideration and whether such Superior Proposal is subject to any material
conditions), (ii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, the Board
of Directors of Seller and/or a committee of the Board of Directors of Seller
determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or
revisions made or proposed to be made by Buyer and after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (iii) Seller prior to or
concurrently with such termination pays to Buyer in immediately available
funds all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.2(b).



 

59 8.2 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger and the Upstream Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting
from any willful breach of this Agreement, and (ii) the provisions set forth
in the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

(b) Seller shall pay Buyer a termination fee of $27,034,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") in the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to:

(i) Section 8.1(c) (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iv));

(ii) Section 8.1(d)(ii); or

(iii) Section 8.1(b)(iii) or, if the Seller Stockholders Approval has not
been obtained prior to termination of this Agreement, Section 8.1(b)(i), in
either case, if, at or prior to the time of such failure, an Acquisition
Proposal shall be publicly disclosed, and within twelve (12) months after such
termination a definitive agreement shall have been entered into providing for
an Acquisition Proposal which is closed within twenty four (24) months of such
termination ( _provided_ that, for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(iii), all
references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%").

(iv) Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2(b)
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Buyer, Merger Sub and Merger LLC would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Seller fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer, Merger Sub or
Merger LLC commences a suit that results in a judgment against Seller for the
fee set forth in this Section 8.2(b) or any portion of such fee, Seller shall
pay to Buyer, Merger Sub or Merger LLC its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the prime rate of JP Morgan Chase and Co. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid by Seller, the Termination Fee shall be Buyers, Merger Subs and
Merger LLCs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this
Agreement.



 

60 8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards
of Directors or managing member, as applicable, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger to the Seller
Stockholders; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Seller Stockholders, no
amendment of this Agreement shall be made that by law or in accordance with
the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by the Seller
Stockholders without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Seller Stockholders Approval, no
extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be made
that by law requires further adoption and approval by the Seller Stockholders
without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement, or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words

9.5 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
