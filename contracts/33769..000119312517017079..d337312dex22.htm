Material Adverse Effect has occurred); or (K) the availability or cost of
equity, debt or other financing required by Buyer; _provided_ , _ _ that,
with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), such change, event,

Employee immediately prior to the Closing. As of January 1, 2018, Buyer will
conduct a review of the health benefits available to Continuing Employees in a
manner consistent with its review of the health benefits available to
similarly situated Buyer Party employees and, subject to the results of
such review, take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that the Continuing
Employees will be eligible for health benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to those generally made available to similarly-
situated Buyer Party employees.

(b) Buyer will cause any employee benefit plans which the Continuing Employees
are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of

a duplication of benefits, service by employees of the Company as if such
service were with Buyer, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company.

 



-45-  Buyer will cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Buyer or its Affiliates to
be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents and give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles, coinsurance and annual
out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date
for which payment has been made.

 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, honor all employee benefit
obligations to current and former employees under the Benefit Plans in

and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company when compared to the insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the
Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years from
the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company, in each case with respect to claims arising out of
or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

 

(c) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section 5.6_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any

5.7 _Pre-Closing Reorganization; Redemption_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall distribute all assets and Liabilities

Liabilities, (b) repayment of indebtedness and the extinguishment of Liens on
Company assets relating to the Cheese Business, (c) formation or dissolution

(b) Immediately following the later to occur of the Class B Issuance and the
consummation of the Cheese Business Reorganization and, in any event, prior to
the Closing, the Company shall redeem all of the Preferred Stock at a
redemption price per share of Preferred Stock equal to the sum of (i) the par
value per share of Preferred Stock plus (ii) an amount equal to the sum of all
accrued or declared but unpaid dividends, if any, on such share of Preferred
Stock (such sum being the " _Redemption Price_ "). Any and all consideration
received by the Company in exchange for distribution of the Cheese Business,
together with an amount of cash equal to any deficiency between the amount
consideration so received and the aggregate Redemption Price payable to Libra
Foundation pursuant to this _Section 5.7(b)_ , shall be transferred to Libra

actions that Sellers determine are required or otherwise reasonably necessary
or appropriate to: (x) consummate the Redemption, (y) repay all indebtedness
and extinguish all Liabilities of the Company related to the Redemption and

period (or portion thereof) on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Tax Returns_"). Unless otherwise

 



-47-  required by Law, the Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior Tax Returns. Buyer shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) the Pre-Closing Tax Returns to the Sellers Representative for
its review and comment not later than 25 days prior to the due date of such
Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Buyer shall incorporate all reasonable changes
requested by the Sellers Representative at least five days prior to the due
date of the Pre-Closing Tax Returns, except to the extent that such changes
(i) would be inconsistent with the past practice of the Company, (ii) would
not be in accordance with applicable Law or (iii) would establish a precedent
or practice materially adverse to the continuing business of the Company or
any Affiliate thereof. Buyer shall cause such Pre-Closing Tax Returns to be
filed on a timely basis and shall pay all Taxes reflected on such Pre-Closing
Tax Returns. Sellers shall be liable for and shall reimburse Buyer for the
amount of Tax reflected on the Pre-Closing Tax Returns attributable to the
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Period_"). With respect to periods beginning before the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ "), the amount of
Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be determined on an
interim closing of the books basis, except for ad valorem Taxes which shall be
prorated on a daily basis (for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Payoff Amount
and the Cheese Business Reorganization shall be attributable wholly to the
Pre-Closing Period); _provided_ , that deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflecting any differences between book and Tax items will not be taken into
account (and, more generally, Tax principles rather than financial accounting
principles will apply) in determining the amount of Taxes attributable to the
Pre-Closing Period. Buyer shall not, and shall not allow the Company after
the Closing Date to, (i) amend any Tax Return filed with respect to the Pre-
Closing Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to
the Pre-Closing Period, in each case without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes
received by the Company in respect of the Pre-Closing Period except to the
extent that such refund is attributable to a loss in a period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (e.g., a carryback). Buyer shall
cause the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
refunds to which it may be entitled and shall promptly deliver to the Sellers
Representative for distribution to the Sellers any such refunds to the extent
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Buyer shall be entitled to
all other refunds of Taxes of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.8(a)_ to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to provide any
records, Tax Returns or any other information to the Sellers Representative,
in each case which includes any information relating to any member (other than
the Company) of a consolidated, unity or combined group including Buyer.

 

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, reasonably
cooperate and shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives to
reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to any
Tax period beginning before the Closing Date, including maintaining and making
available to each other, and to any Governmental Entity as
reasonably requested, all records necessary in connection with Taxes of the
Company and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to any Tax
period beginning before the Closing Date relating to Taxes. Sellers and Buyer
agree (i) to retain all books and records (or, in the alternative, to deliver
such books and records to the Company) with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date
until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Entity, (ii) to allow the other Party (or

 



-48-  Parties) and its (or their) representatives, at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as such Party (or Parties) may deem necessary or appropriate from time to
time, such activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at such
Partys (or Parties) expense and (iii) to give the other Party (or Parties)
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other Party (or Parties) so requests,
Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party (or Parties)
to take possession of such books and records prior to such transfer,
destruction or discard.

(c) Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall share
equally all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, recording, value added,
registration and other similar Taxes and all conveyance fees, real property
transfer taxes, recording fees and other similar charges (all including
penalties, interest and other charges with respect thereto, collectively "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to protect, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the other from and against its or their respective share of
all Transfer Taxes so incurred.

(d) If a claim with respect to Taxes shall be made by any Governmental
Entity, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 8.2_:

(i) Buyer shall promptly and in any event no more than five days following
Buyers receipt of notice of such claim, give written notice to the Sellers
Representative of such claim (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such prompt notice shall not affect Sellers

participate (at the sole cost and expense of Sellers) in the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Claim, (C) must conduct the defense actively and
diligently and (D) may not settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;

any direct report thereof (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") or hire
any such Covered Employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation of employment which is not directed specifically to any
such Covered Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ shall restrict the Sellers or any other Person from
soliciting or hiring any Covered Employee whose employment with the Company
has been terminated by the Company prior to the date of first solicitation or
by the employee 60 or more days prior to the date of first

judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any
term or provision contained in _Section 5.9(a)_ or _Section 5.9(b)_ is invalid
or unenforceable, then the Parties agree that the court or tribunal will have
the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid

restrict the Sellers from taking commercially reasonable steps to carry out
their rights and obligations under any of the transaction documents
contemplated by this Agreement.

that their respective representatives shall not, directly or indirectly
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or entertain any inquiries or proposals
from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any nonpublic information to or

indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII, the Indemnified Person shall (at the
Indemnified Persons own expense) promptly notify the Person from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") in writing of such
claim, including any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party

the result of a Third-Party Claim, evidence of the Third-Party Claim)) and
setting out the Indemnified Persons estimate of the amount of Losses to the
extent ascertainable which are, or are to be, the subject of the claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the next sentence, the failure to
provide such notice by a particular time shall not release the Indemnifying
Person from any of the Indemnifying Persons obligations under this ARTICLE
VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person is prejudiced by such
failure. The Parties agree that (i) in this ARTICLE VIII they intend to
shorten, in the case of the limited survival periods specified in _Section_ __

claims; (ii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation must be delivered prior to the expiration of

notice is not delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period specified in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ shall be expressly barred and are hereby waived;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if, prior to such applicable date, a Party shall
have notified the other Party in accordance with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ of a Third-Party Claim (whether or not formal legal
action shall have been commenced based upon such Third-Party Claim), such
Third-Party Claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in
accordance with this ARTICLE VIII notwithstanding the passing of such
applicable date.

 

(b) _Cooperation by the Indemnified Person_. __The Indemnified Person shall
cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Person in determining the validity
of any claim for indemnity made by the Indemnified Person and in defending
against a Third-Party Claim. In connection with any fact, matter, event or
circumstance that may give rise to a claim against any Indemnifying
Person under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person: (i) shall preserve all
material evidence relevant to the claim, (ii) shall allow the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnifying Persons advisers to investigate the fact, matter,
event or circumstance alleged to give rise to such claim and whether and to
what extent any amount is payable in respect of such claim and whether the
Indemnified Party can recover from a third party pursuant to _Section
8.4(a)_, and (iii) shall (at the Indemnified Persons own expense) disclose
to the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnifying Persons representatives all
material of which the Indemnified Person is aware which relates to the claim
and provide (at the Indemnified Persons own expense) all such information
and assistance, including reasonable access upon advance notice and during
normal business hours to premises and personnel, and the right to examine and
copy or photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records relating to
the claim, as the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnifying Persons
representatives may reasonably request, subject to (x) the Indemnifying Person
and the Indemnifying Persons advisers agreeing in such form as the
Indemnified Person may reasonably require to keep all such information
confidential and to use it only for the purpose of investigating and defending
the claim in question; and (y) no Party shall be required to provide any
documents or other information covered by attorney-client privilege, the
attorney work-product doctrine or similar protection.

 

(c) _Assumption of Defense of a Third-Party Claim_. __ Upon receipt of a
notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Person pursuant to
_Section 8.4(a)_ in respect of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person
may, except in the event of an Indemnifying Person Conflict, by notice to the
Indemnified Person delivered within 30 Business Days of the receipt of notice
of such Third-Party Claim, assume the defense and control of any Third-Party
Claim, with the Indemnifying Persons own counsel and at the Indemnifying
Persons own expense, but shall allow the Indemnified Person a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim with the Indemnified Persons own counsel and at the Indemnified
Persons own expense. The Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Person (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), consent to a settlement, compromise or
discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Claim, unless such settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of any judgment
does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission
of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Person. If the Indemnifying Person does
not assume the defense and control of any such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person, subject to _Section 8.4(d)_, may defend the same in such
manner as the Indemnified Person may deem appropriate. For purposes of the

 



-59-  foregoing, an " _Indemnifying Person Conflict_ " shall mean any Third-Party
Claim involving (i) a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; (ii) primarily nonmonetary, equitable or injunctive relief and
nonmonetary relief; (iii) indemnifiable Losses that would reasonably be
expected to exceed the Cap; or (iv) joint representation of an Indemnifying
Person and Indemnified Person if the Indemnified Person shall have received
written advice from outside counsel that an actual or potential conflict of
interest would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person with respect to the Third-
Party Claim.

(d) _Settlement of Claims_. The Indemnified Person shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim
or demand for which the Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification from the
Indemnifying Person without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Person unless there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or
admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnifying Person. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this ARTICLE VIII, no Indemnifying
Person shall have any liability under this ARTICLE VIII for any Losses
arising out of or in connection with any Third-Party Claim that is settled or
compromised by an Indemnified Person without the requisite consent of such
Indemnifying Person.

 

(e) _Response to Claims Not Involving Third-Party Claims_. Except as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ with respect to Tax Claims, in the event any
Indemnifying Person receives a notice of a claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ that does not involve a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall notify the Indemnified
Person within 30 Business Days following the Indemnifying Persons receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Person disputes the Indemnifying Persons
liability to the Indemnified Person under this ARTICLE VIII;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Indemnifying Person fails to notify the Indemnified
Person within the requisite time period, the amount of Losses asserted therein
shall be deemed to be a "Final Determination" for purposes of  _Section
8.7_.

8.5 _Damages Calculation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, in no event shall an Indemnifying Person have any
liability under this ARTICLE VIII to an Indemnified Person for any
consequential, punitive, special, exemplary, incidental or indirect damages,
including lost profits, multiple of profits, or multiple of cash flow or
other valuation methodology, except, in each case, to the extent actually
payable by an Indemnified Person with respect to a Third-Party Claim pursuant
to a Final Determination.

 

8.6 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Recovery from Third-Party Source_. If any Indemnifying Person is liable
to pay an amount in discharge of any claim under this Agreement and any
Indemnified Person recovers from a third party which is not Affiliated with
the Indemnified Person a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Indemnified
Person (in whole or in part) in respect of the Loss which is the
subject matter of the claim, Sellers Representative or Buyer, as applicable,
shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be, such claim to the extent of such
recovery less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with receiving such recovery and any related increases in insurance
premiums. If any Indemnifying Person has paid an amount in discharge of any
claim under this Agreement and any Indemnified Person recovers

 



-60-  from a third party a sum which indemnifies or compensates any Indemnified
Person (in whole or in part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject
matter of the claim, Sellers Representative or Buyer, as applicable, shall
ensure that all steps are taken as may reasonably be required to enforce such
recovery and shall, or shall ensure that the relevant Indemnified Person
shall, pay to Sellers Representative or Buyer, as applicable, as soon as
practicable after receipt an amount equal to (i) any sum recovered from the
third party less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such
recovery and any related increases in insurance premiums to the extent
arising from such Loss or (ii) if less, the amount previously paid by the
relevant Indemnifying Person to the relevant Indemnified Person.

 

(b) _Taxes_. In determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify a
Party claiming a Loss, the amount of such Loss shall be reduced to take into
account any net Tax benefit that is actually recognized by such Party with
respect to such Loss (including the utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit
carried forward). The net Tax benefit that is actually recognized by
such Party for a taxable year shall be the excess, if any, of (i) such
Partys cumulative Liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the payment at issue for
all taxable years, over (ii) such Partys actual cumulative Liability for
Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account
any Tax items attributable to the payment at issue for all taxable years (to
the extent permitted by relevant Tax Law). For avoidance of doubt, the result
of the foregoing is to treat such Tax items as the last items claimed for any
taxable year. If a net Tax benefit is not recognized in or prior to the
taxable period during which an indemnification payment is made or the Party
claiming a Loss incurs or pays such Loss, such Party thereafter shall make
payments in accordance with this Article VIII to the Indemnifying Party to
reflect the net Tax benefit actually recognized in each subsequent taxable
period, promptly after determining such net Tax benefit for each such taxable
period; _provided_ , that on or before the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Sellers Representatives and Buyer shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith an agreed
settlement of any such net Tax benefit (e.g., the net present value of any
anticipated Tax benefit).

 

8.7 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Person shall pay (or cause to be paid by
issuing joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse funds from the Indemnification Escrow Fund) to the
Indemnified Person the amount of any Losses for which the Indemnifying Person
is liable hereunder, in immediately available funds, to an account specified
by the Indemnified Person no later than three days following any Final
Determination of such Losses and the Indemnifying Persons liability therefor.
A " _Final Determination_ " shall exist when (a) the parties to the
dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (b) a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable Order or judgment
with respect to the subject matter of the claim or (c) an arbitration or like
panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to
disputes the Parties have agreed to submit thereto. Any amounts for which any
Seller may be liable hereunder shall be payable first from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund; following such time when there are no amounts
remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, any amounts for which a Seller
may be severally liable hereunder shall be payable directly by such Seller to
the extent of such Sellers Pro Rata Share.

 



-61- 8.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made by an
Indemnifying Person to an Indemnified Person in respect of any claim pursuant
to _Sections 8.2_ or _8.3_ hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the
consideration paid pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for Tax purposes. 

8.9 _Double Claims_. No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover from
any Indemnifying Person (i) under this ARTICLE VIII more than once in respect
of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such Loss may result from breaches of
multiple provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) in respect of any Loss to the
extent the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to the claim or on
which it is based is allowed, provided, accrued or reserved for in the
Financial Statements or is provided for or otherwise taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price provided herein.

 

8.10 _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Persons shall ensure that all commercially
reasonable steps are taken and all commercially reasonable assistance is
given to avoid or mitigate any Losses, which in the absence of mitigation
would reasonably be expected to give rise to or increase a Loss in respect of
any claim under this ARTICLE VIII.

 

8.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Sections
1.6(e)(ii)_, _1.6(g)_ and _10.14_ and except with respect to actual fraud
committed in making the representations set forth in this Agreement, if the
Closing occurs, the remedies set forth in this ARTICLE VIII shall provide the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for any breach of this Agreement
(other than any covenant which by the terms of this Agreement is to be
performed after the Closing, for which the Parties shall be entitled to
injunctive or other equitable relief); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not interfere with or impede the working capital reconciliation set forth in
_Section 1.5_ or the resolution of disputes relating to the Earn-out
Calculation pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing occurs,
except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including
_Section 10.14_ hereof, the remedies available in this ARTICLE VIII
supersede any other remedies available at law or in equity including rights
of rescission and claims arising under applicable Law, and each Party hereby
waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of action, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which
exist or may arise in the future, arising under or based upon any federal,
state or local Law, that any Party may have against another Party in respect
of any breach of this Agreement.

-63-  advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling Persons, in each case
relating to the Sellers Representatives conduct as Sellers Representative,
including all out-of-pocket expenses incurred for legal fees or otherwise,
other than losses, Liabilities or expenses resulting from the Sellers
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its performance under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The costs of
such indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right
of indemnification) shall be individual obligations of the Sellers based on

instruction or other communication otherwise given in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_.

10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits and schedules
hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter, the
Employment Agreements, the Transition Services Agreement, the Trademark
License Agreement, the Trademark Assignment Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement, 

 



-67-  dated May 6, 2016, between BEF Foods, Inc. and the Company (as it may be
amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF BUYER,
SELLERS, SELLERS REPRESENTATIVE OR THE COMPANY MAKES OR RELIES ON ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE
AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR THE OTHER
PARTYS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. No Party shall be bound by, or be liable
for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention
not contained in this Agreement.

 

10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 5.6_
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), ARTICLE VIII and
ARTICLE IX only, the Parties hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the respective other Party, in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of
the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.1_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. Persons other than the Parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the Execution Date
or as of any other date.

10.8 _Attorney Client Matter_. Buyer agrees to comply with the provisions of
this  _Section 10.8_ and, following the Closing, agrees to cause its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company)
(collectively with Buyer, the " _Buyer Parties_ ") to comply with the
provisions of this _Section 10.8_ and to execute and deliver any documents
or agreements reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative to implement
such provisions. Notwithstanding any representation of the Company by Sullivan
and Cromwell LLP (" _S andC_") prior to the Closing Date, each Buyer Party: (i)
consents to SandCs representation of the Sellers Representative and/or any
Seller (the " _Seller Parties_ ") in connection with any matters or disputes
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; (ii) waives any claim it has or
may have that SandC has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation based upon SandCs prior representation of the
Company; and (iii) agrees that, if a dispute arises between any Seller Party,
on the one hand, and any Buyer Party, on the other hand, SandC may represent
such

 



-68-  Seller Party notwithstanding that the interests of such Seller Party and
such Buyer Party may be directly adverse and that SandC may have represented the
Company in a substantially related matter. As to all communications prior to
the Closing that relate in any way to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and that are (x) privileged
communications between SandC or another legal advisor, on the one hand, and,
prior to the Closing, any Seller Party or the Company, on the other hand, or
(y) communications that refer or relate to such privileged communications
(collectively, " _Confidential Communications_ "), each Buyer Party agrees
that the attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege
exists, to the applicable Seller Party, may be controlled by such Seller Party
and will not pass to or be claimed by any Buyer Party. Each Buyer Party will
not assert that privilege has been waived with respect to Confidential
Communications coming into the possession of such Buyer Party. To the extent
that any Buyer Party has or maintains any control of such privilege of such
Confidential Communications, such Buyer Party will not, except as may be
required by applicable Law, waive or attempt to waive such privilege without
the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that, following the Closing, a dispute arises between
any Buyer Party and a third party (other than a Seller Party, but including
any Governmental Entity), such Buyer Party shall assert the attorney-client
privilege against such third party to the extent necessary to prevent
disclosure of Confidential Communications. Each Buyer Party further agrees
that Confidential Communications shall be and remain the exclusive property of
the Seller Parties, notwithstanding that some Confidential Communications may
have come into the possession of the Buyer Parties. Each Buyer Party will take
reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential
Communications. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Seller
Parties, who are intended third party beneficiaries hereof.

 

10.9 _Obligations of Buyer_. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of
Buyer to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Buyer to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

10.10 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

10.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



-69- 10.12 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to an Annex, Exhibit, Section or Schedule, such
reference shall be to an Annex, Exhibit, Section or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation."

 

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) Each Party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in a
letter delivered to the other Party (a " _Disclosure Letter_ ") in a Section
of such Disclosure Letter that corresponds to the Section of this Agreement to
which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

10.13 _Assignment_. No Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that Buyer may
assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of
its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of
any of its obligations hereunder). Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement is void.

 

10.14 _Guarantee_.

(a) Guarantor __ unconditionally, irrevocably and absolutely guarantees that
Buyer shall fully, completely and punctually pay and perform all of its
obligations hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The
guarantee contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ shall terminate when (and
only when) Buyer shall have fully paid the Earn-out Payment pursuant to and in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ (such period, the " _Guarantee Period_
"). Guarantor __ is guaranteeing the Guaranteed Obligations as primary obligor
and not merely as surety. If, for any reason whatsoever, Buyer shall fail to,
or be unable to fully, completely, and punctually pay and perform the
Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor __ will forthwith, without any notice or
demand whatsoever, pay and cause to be paid in dollars, with respect to
payment obligations, or perform or cause to be performed, with respect to
performance obligations, the Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor hereby
expressly and irrevocably waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
filing objections with a court, any right or requirement that any Party
exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against Buyer, any right to
require the prior disposition of the assets of Buyer to meet their
obligations, lack of validity or the unenforceability of Guarantors __
guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations, any rights to set-offs, recoupments
and counterclaims (except to the extent Buyer is entitled to such rights
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement or otherwise, which rights
result in a reduction of the Guaranteed Obligations), notice, protest and all
demands whatsoever. The guarantee contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_
shall apply regardless of 

 



-70-  any amendments, modifications, waivers or extensions to this Agreement
whether or not Guarantor receives notice of the same and Guarantor waives all
need for notice of the same. Guarantor _ _ agrees that the guarantee
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ is a guarantee of payment and
performance and not of collectability. The obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 10.14_ shall survive the Closing and/or a termination of this Agreement
and continue in full force and effect thereafter. Guarantor __ shall not
transfer or assign, in whole or in part, any of its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.14_ and any such assignment is null and void.

(b) There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this  _Section_
__ _ 10.14_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the obligations
of Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional and
such obligations shall be binding upon Guarantor, its successors and assigns
and inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company, Sellers and
the Sellers Representative and its successors and permitted assigns.

 

(c) Guarantor __ represents and warrants to the Company and the Sellers:

 

(i) _Authority; Approval_. Guarantor __ has all requisite corporate power and
authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute
and deliver this Agreement and perform its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 10.14_. This Agreement has been, and each other agreement, document,
certificate and instrument to be delivered by Guarantor in connection with
this Agreement will be, duly executed and delivered by Guarantor __ and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties hereto
(other than Buyer), constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Guarantor __
enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(ii) _Financial Capability_. Guarantor __ has the financial capability to
perform its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ when due, and
Guarantor __ acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are not
conditioned upon the receipt of any financing proceeds.
