(a) _Capital Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ below and
excluding Dissenting Shares) shall be converted and exchanged into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest equal to the Final Per Share
Consideration (including a contingent right to receive a portion of the
Earnout Payment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.14_). As used herein, the
" _Final Per Share Consideration_ " shall mean the quotient of (x) the Net
Merger Consideration, divided by (y) the sum of the number of issued and
outstanding Shares, on an as-converted to Common Stock basis immediately
prior to the Effective Time plus the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to Vested Options and Warrants.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All Shares that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

Option in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Vested Options, each Vested Option
shall be cancelled and converted into a right to receive, in respect of each
share of Common Stock subject to such Vested Option, without interest,
subject to applicable withholding Taxes, at the respective times and subject
to the withholdings and adjustments set forth in _Sections_ _2.9_ and _2.10_
and the execution and delivery of a duly executed Option Termination
Agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit E_ (each such
agreement, an " _Option Termination Agreement_ "), an amount in cash equal to:
(A) the Final Per Share Consideration, minus (B) the exercise price per share
under such Vested Option. For the avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Vested
Option will be entitled to receive a portion of the Earnout Payment, if any,
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.14_. The amount of cash each holder of
a Vested Option is entitled to receive for all Vested Options held by such
holder shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after

actions necessary to provide that each Unvested Option and Out-of-the-Money
Option shall be terminated and canceled for no consideration.

 

(iii) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide any notices and
transmittal information to holders of Vested Options, Unvested Options, and
the Out-of-the-Money Options, and the board of directors of the Company shall
adopt any resolutions necessary to effectuate the foregoing, in each case
after giving Acquiror reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
notice or resolution. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of a Vested Option
an executed Option Termination Agreement and the execution of an Option
Termination Agreement shall be a condition to each holder of a Vested Option
receiving any payment under _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(i)_.

 

(d) _Warrants_.

(i) Acquiror shall not assume, continue or otherwise replace any Warrants in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Warrants, each Warrant shall be
cancelled and converted into a right to receive, in respect of each share of
Common Stock subject to such Warrant, without interest, subject to applicable
withholding Taxes, at the respective times and subject to the withholdings and
adjustments set forth in _Sections_ _2.9_ and _2.10_ and the execution and
delivery of a duly executed Warrant Termination Agreement substantially in
the form attached as _Exhibit F_ (each such agreement, an " _Warrant
Termination Agreement_ "), an amount in cash equal to: (A) the Final Per Share
Consideration, minus (B) the exercise price per share under such Warrant. For
the avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Warrant will be entitled to receive a
portion of the Earnout Payment, if any, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.14_. The amount of cash each holder of a Warrant is entitled to receive for
all Warrants held by such holder shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Warrants held by such holder.

 

(ii) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide any notices and
transmittal information to holders of Warrants, and the board of directors of
the Company shall adopt any resolutions necessary to effectuate the foregoing,
in each case after giving Acquiror reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the notice or resolution. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder
of a Warrant an executed Warrant Termination Agreement and the execution of a
Warrant Termination Agreement shall be a condition to each holder of a Warrant
receiving any payment under _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)(i)_.

(e) _Capital Stock of_ _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate, if any, of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(f) _Maximum Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount paid to the Equityholders in
exchange for Shares and cancellation of Vested Options and Warrants exceed the
Net Merger Consideration, in each case pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 



15

    

2.7 _Allocation of Consideration_. Concurrently with the delivery of the
Closing Certificate, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror a funds flow
statement, in form and substance acceptable to Acquiror (the " _Payment
Schedule_ "), setting forth with respect to each Equityholder and each Person
to whom any Company Transaction Expense or Closing Indebtedness is payable or
due at Closing, such Persons name, address and email address, the amounts
payable to each such Person in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
their Percentage, and payment instructions with respect to each such payee,
including whether each payee will be paid by the Paying Agent or through
payroll, and setting forth the Percentage for each Equityholder.

 

2.8 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Acquiror has designated JPMorgan Chase to act as the
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying each
Stockholder such Stockholders share of the Net Merger Consideration, to be
allocated among the Stockholders in accordance with the Payment Schedule
delivered to Acquiror by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the
Paying Agent to distribute letters of transmittal substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit_ _D_ (the " _Transmittal Letters_ ") to each
Stockholder and Warrant holder at the address of record with the Company
advising such Stockholder and Warrant holder of the effectiveness of the
Merger and the procedures for surrendering to the Paying Agent such
Stockholders Shares and Warrants and Transmittal Letter (with all other
documentation required to be delivered pursuant to the Transmittal Letter) in
exchange for the portion of the Net Merger Consideration payable to such
Stockholder or Warrant holder pursuant to this Agreement as set forth on the
Payment Schedule. Each Transmittal Letter shall contain the Stockholders and
Warrant holders acknowledgement of its indemnification obligations hereunder,
ratification of the appointment of the Equityholder Representative, a release
of claims against the Group Companies and covenants
regarding confidentiality.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of all required documentation
from a Stockholder, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such Stockholder, in
accordance with the terms of such Stockholders Transmittal Letter, the amount
set forth opposite such Stockholders name on the Payment Schedule as payable
on account of such Stockholders Shares as the aggregate share of the Closing
Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder, less such Stockholders
applicable Percentage of the Escrow Fund and Expense Fund, respectively, in
exchange for such Stockholders Shares (such consideration subject to
adjustment as provided herein and any applicable withholding Taxes). In the
event of a conflict between the Payment Schedule and the provisions of this
Agreement, the Payment Schedule shall control. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or in the Organizational Documents of any of the Group
Companies, Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Equityholder
Representative and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on the Payment
Schedule as conclusive evidence of amounts payable to the Stockholders
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Equityholder in whose
name the surrendered Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Equityholder shall have
signed the Transmittal Letter and paid all transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

 



16

    

(e) Until properly surrendered or canceled, any certificate representing
Shares shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive
the portion of the Net Merger Consideration payable in exchange for Shares
held by such Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement. The Stockholders shall
not be entitled to receive any portion of the Net Merger Consideration to
which they would otherwise be entitled until their respective Transmittal
Letters (with all other documentation required to be delivered pursuant to the
Transmittal Letter) are properly delivered and surrendered in accordance with
this Agreement.

(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, nor the
Equityholder Representative shall be liable to any Person for any amount paid
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares (other than any such shares to be canceled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law, if such Section
provides for appraisal rights for such shares in the Merger (any of such
shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or
be exchangeable for the right to receive a portion of the Net Merger
Consideration unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under Delaware
Law or California Law. If, after the Effective Time, any such Stockholder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of
the Net Merger Consideration, if any, to which such Stockholder is entitled,
without interest. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Acquiror
(a) reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal or exercise of Shares pursuant to Delaware Law or California Law,
respectively, and (b) the opportunity to participate in (but not direct) all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Group Companies shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Acquiror (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, such demands. 

(i) _Vested Options_. On the next regularly scheduled payroll date of the
Surviving Corporation occurring more than five (5) Business Days but less
than twenty (20) Business Days following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each holder of a Vested Option (other than with
respect to Non-Withholding Options) for whom Acquiror has received a duly
executed Option Termination Agreement an amount in cash equal to the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Vested Option multiplied by an amount
equal to the difference between (a) the Per Share Closing Consideration,
minus (b) the exercise price per share under such Vested Option, minus (c)
such holders applicable Percentage of the Escrow Amount in respect of such
Vested Option (the " _Closing Options Payout Amount_ "). Following the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall cause the applicable Closing Options
Payout Amount to be paid to each holder of a Vested Option which is a Non-
Withholding Option for whom Acquiror has received a duly executed Option
Termination Agreement. The Closing Options Payout Amount payable to each
holder of a Vested Option shall be set forth opposite

 



17

    

 such holders name on the Payment Schedule (such consideration subject to
adjustment as provided herein and any applicable withholding Taxes). In the
event of a conflict between the Payment Schedule and the provisions of this
Agreement, the Payment Schedule shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (as amended as of the date hereof) (the " _Restated
Certificate_ "), Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Equityholder Representative and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on
the Payment Schedule as conclusive evidence of amounts payable to the holders
of Vested Options pursuant to this Agreement. Each holder of a Vested Option,
subject to receipt of a duly executed Option Termination Agreement, shall be
entitled to receive with respect to each Vested Option subject thereto,
such holders Percentage of the Earnout Payments, as and when such payments
are required to be made, which amount shall be paid on the same schedule and
on the same terms and conditions as apply to the Stockholders generally.

 

(j) _Interest_. No interest shall be payable hereunder with respect to the Net
Merger Consideration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
interest shall accrue or be paid to any Stockholder or any holder of any
Option or Warrant with respect to the portion of the Net Merger Consideration
payable with respect to payable in exchange for any Option or Warrant.

 

(k) _Undistributed Closing Funds_. Any funds held by the Paying Agent that
remain undistributed to Equityholders holding non-Dissenting Shares as of the
first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to Acquiror upon
demand, and such Equityholder holding non-Dissenting Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Agreement shall
thereafter look only to Acquiror for satisfaction of their claims for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Shares, without any interest
thereon.

 

2.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment._

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. The Company shall have prepared and
delivered to Acquiror two Business Days prior to the Closing Date a statement
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), which shall take into account any
reasonable comments from Acquiror that the Company shall determine in good
faith are appropriate to ensure that the items set forth therein conform with
the provisions of this Agreement, setting forth (A) the Companys estimate of
Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), (B) the
Companys estimate of Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (C)
the Companys estimate of Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_
") and (D) the Companys estimate of Company Transaction Expenses (the "
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), along with a certificate executed by the
Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (the " _Closing
Certificate_ ") certifying as to the amount of the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated
Transaction Expenses. The Closing Certificate shall be accompanied by executed
payoff letters from each holder of Closing Indebtedness that relates to
borrowed money. The Closing Certificate shall include a funds flow statement
which shall take into account any reasonable comments from Acquiror to ensure
that the items set forth therein conform with the provisions of this
Agreement, setting forth with respect to each Equityholder and each Person to
whom any Company Transaction Expenses and Closing Indebtedness is payable or
due at Closing, the amounts payable to each such Person in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and payment instructions with respect to each such
payee, and setting forth the Percentage for each Equityholder. The Company
will prepare the Estimated Closing Statement on an accrual basis in accordance
with GAAP using the same accounting methods, practices, principles and
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Companys
Financial Statements. The Company shall also make available to Acquiror all
financial records, work papers, or other documentation as Acquiror may
reasonably request in connection with its review of the Estimated Closing
Statement.

 



18

    

(b) _Post-Closing Determination_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall conduct a
review of the Closing Working Capital and shall deliver to the Equityholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Acquirors calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses. The Closing Statement shall
also contain the draft balance sheet from which the Closing Working Capital
was determined and back-up calculations from which Closing Indebtedness was
determined. Acquiror will prepare the Closing Statement on an accrual basis
in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles and policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Companys Financial Statements.

(ii) If the Equityholder Representative disagrees with Acquirors computation
of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness or Company
Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Closing Statement, the Equityholder
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Closing Statement deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Acquiror
setting forth in reasonable detail the Equityholder Representatives
objections. If an Objection Notice is not delivered to Acquiror within such
thirty (30) day period, then the computation of the Closing Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses as
reflected on the Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon
Acquiror and the Equityholders. If an Objection Notice is delivered to
Acquiror within such thirty (30) day period, then Acquiror and the
Equityholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements as to the computation of the Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses, but if there is no
final resolution with respect to any amounts remaining in dispute (the "
_Disputed Amounts_ ") within thirty (30) days after Acquiror has received the
Objection Notice, Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative shall jointly
retain a mutually acceptable and independent, accounting firm of national
standing (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any disagreements relating
only to the Disputed Amounts and to determine the Final Closing Cash, Final
Working Capital, Final Indebtedness and/or the Final Transaction Expenses
(each as defined below). If Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative
are unable to agree upon an Accounting Firm within ten (10) days, then the
Accounting Firm shall be an accounting firm of national standing designated by
the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois (unless another
location may be mutually agreed by Acquiror and the Equityholder
Representative). Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative shall each
submit all back-up documentation to the Accounting Firm promptly (and in any
event within ten (10) days after the Accounting Firms engagement), which
documentation shall include such partys computation of the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses
and information, arguments and support for such partys position with respect
to the Disputed Amounts. The Accounting Firm shall review all such
documentation and base its determination solely on such documentation in
accordance with GAAP and in accordance with the definitions of Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Company Transaction
Expenses herein. In resolving such Disputed Amounts, the Accounting Firm may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value used for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The determination of the Accounting Firm, or any
final resolution agreed to in writing by Acquiror and the
Equityholder Representative, shall be conclusive and binding upon Acquiror
and the Equityholders. The Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(b)_ are referred to as the " _Final_ _Working
Capital_ ," " _Final Closing Cash_ ," " _Final Indebtedness_ " and "
_Final Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively, herein.

 



19

    

(iii) The Equityholders shall pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm equal to 100% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm that
are resolved in favor of Acquiror (that being the difference between the
Accounting Firms determination and the Equityholder Representatives
determination) and the denominator of which is the total amount of the
Disputed Amounts submitted to the Accounting Firm (that being the sum total by
which Acquirors determination and the Equityholder Representatives
determination differ from the determination of the Accounting Firm). Acquiror
shall pay that portion of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm that
the Equityholders are not required to pay hereunder. By way of example, if
the Equityholder Representative claims that Closing Working Capital should be
$2,000,000 and Acquiror claims it should be $1,000,000 and the correct amount
is determined by the Accounting Firm to be $1,250,000, then assuming the
Accounting Firms fees are $200,000, $150,000 of such fees would be payable
by the Equityholders and $50,000 would be payable by Acquiror.

(iv) Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make its financial
records, accounting personnel and advisors available in a prompt and timely
manner to (i) the Equityholder Representative in connection with carrying out
its duties under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ and (ii) the Accounting Firm
during its review.

(c) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is less than $0.00, then the Total Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted downward by the amount of such difference,
and Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative shall deliver joint written
notice to the Escrow Agent to release to Acquiror from the Indemnification
Escrow an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. If the Indemnification
Escrow shall be insufficient to satisfy payment of such difference, the
Equityholders shall pay, pro rata based on each such Equityholders
Percentage, to Acquiror such remaining portion of the shortfall by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing
by Acquiror within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of notice of such
shortage.

 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is greater than $0.00, then the Total Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess and
Acquiror shall pay to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, on behalf of the Equityholders in proportion to their respective
Percentage such excess by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts set forth in the Closing Certificate within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount.

 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is $0.00, then no payment shall be made
with respect thereto by any party to this Agreement.

 

(iv) All payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_ shall be
treated as adjustments to the Net Merger Consideration for tax purposes,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, and such agreed treatment
shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

 



20

    

2.10 _Escrow and Expense Fund_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, as a
deposit to the Escrow Fund, cash in an amount equal to $10,500,000 (the "
_Indemnification_ _Escrow_ " and the amount of the Indemnification Escrow, the
" _Escrow Amount_ ") from the Closing Merger Consideration for the purpose of
securing the obligations of the Equityholders under this Agreement. In
addition, on such date, Acquiror shall cause the Expense Fund to be deposited
with the Equityholder Representative. Each Equityholders Percentage of the
Escrow Amount and Expense Fund shall be withheld from the Closing Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to such Equityholder on the Closing Date. The
Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall
be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment,
trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Person,
and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow shall be
distributed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.7(b)_. The Expense Fund shall
be held by the Equityholder Representative and distributed in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_.

(b) The approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders, and the acceptance of
a portion of the Total Merger Consideration by the Equityholders, shall
constitute approval of (i) the Escrow Agreement and of all of the arrangements
relating thereto, including the placement of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow
Fund, in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and (ii) the
arrangements with the Equityholder Representative contemplated by this
Agreement, including the establishment of the Expense Fund in the manner
contemplated hereby.

 

2.11 _Written Consent_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company shall solicit the written consent of the
Stockholders approving this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby
in accordance with Law and the Organizational Documents. Within 24 hours
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall

Agreement dated as of January 19, 2017 by and among the Company and certain of
the Stockholders with the exception of _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ thereof (the "
_Written Consent_ "). In the event that the Written Consent is not delivered
by the Company to Acquiror within such 24-hour period, Acquiror, at its sole
option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

Property, (ii) the Company to be bound by, or subject to, any non-compete,
non-solicit or other restriction on the operation or scope of its business,

currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or otherwise
used or occupied by the Company (the " _Leased Real Property_ "), the name of
the lessor, licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or lessee, the date and
term of the lease, license, sublease or other occupancy right and each

complete copies of all leases, lease guaranties, licenses, subleases,
agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or otherwise granting a right
in or relating to the Leased Real Property, including all amendments,
terminations and modifications thereof (the " _Lease Agreements_ "). To the
Companys

 



32

    

 Knowledge, all such Lease Agreements are in full force and effect and are
valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. There is not,
under any Lease Agreements, any existing default or event of default (or
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
of the Company, or to the Companys Knowledge, any other party thereto. The
Company currently occupies all of the Leased Real Property for the operation
of its business, and there are no other parties occupying, or with a right to
occupy, the Leased Real Property.

 

(b) All Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair and is
suitable for the conduct of the Companys business as presently conducted
therein. Neither the operation of the Company on the Leased Real Property nor,
to the Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, violates any Law
relating to such property or operations thereon. The Company would not
be required to expend more than $50,000 in causing any Leased Real Property
to comply with the surrender conditions set forth in the applicable Lease
Agreement. The Company has performed in all material respects, its obligations
under any termination agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any
leases of real property that are no longer in effect and has no continuing
liability with respect to such terminated real property leases. The Company is
not a party to any Contract or subject to any claim that could require the
payment of any real estate brokerage commissions, and no such commission is
owed with respect to any of the Leased Real Property. The Company does not owe
any brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any Leased Real
Property and would not owe any such fees if any existing Lease Agreement were
renewed pursuant to any renewal options contained in such Lease Agreements.

 

(c) The Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, free and clear of any Liens, except (i) as reflected in the
Financial Statements, or (ii) Permitted Liens.

 

(d) All equipment owned or leased by the Company currently in use and held for
future use is (i) adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company as
currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be conducted, and (ii) in
good operating condition, regularly and properly maintained, subject to normal
wear and tear.

 

3.12 _Financial Statements_. The Company has delivered to Acquiror true,
correct and complete copies of its audited consolidated financial statements
for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017,
and its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the period from
January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 (collectively, the " _Financial
Statements_ "). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited Financial Statements may not contain all footnotes
required by GAAP. The Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated
financial condition and operating results of the Company as of the dates, and
for the periods, indicated therein, in all material respects. Except as set
forth in the Financial Statements, the Company has no liabilities or
obligations, contingent or otherwise, other than liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent Financial
Statements, which, in all such cases, individually and in the aggregate are

audits, suits, investigations or claims with respect to any Company Employee
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except for the portion of such
plan sponsored by Insperity which does not cover employees of the Company (or

(a) The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this
Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or any Transaction

 Authorized Shares), _3.2(c)_ (Capitalization  Outstanding Equity), _3.4_
(Authorization) and _3.17_ (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until the

3.7(a)_ , _3.7(c)_ , _3.7(g)_ , _3.7(p)_ and _3.7(q)_ (Intellectual Property)
(collectively, the " _IP Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing through

_further_ , that solely with respect to claims for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, all such representations and

(as defined below) as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have given
notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for
indemnification) to the indemnifying party in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.4_ before the termination of the applicable Survival Period. Claims under
_Sections 8.2(a)(ii)_ through _(viii)_ may be made until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (any such period of survival set forth

before expiration of the applicable Survival Period of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_,

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or a notice that, as a result

Representative. It is the express intent of the parties that, if an applicable
Survival Period as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ is shorter than
the statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the survival period
contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods

accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

indemnification from the Group Companies irrespective of whether such Claim
results from an action or inaction by a Group Company or the Equityholders,
(ii) the Equityholders (in their capacities as such) shall have no right
of contribution from the Group Companies irrespective of whether such Claim
results from an action or inaction by a Group Company or the Equityholders
(provided that the foregoing shall not affect the right of an Equityholder
that is a DandO Indemnified Person under the DandO Tail Policy or under the
Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation or bylaws or under any
indemnification agreement or similar agreement the Equityholder may have with
the Company) and (iii) there shall be no proration of the obligation to pay
any Losses between the Group Companies and the Equityholders (in their

Effect" shall be disregarded solely for the purposes of calculating any Losses
in respect of a breach of a representation and warranty.

 

8.3 [Reserved]

8.4  _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought, provided that with respect to any claim against the Equityholders
generally or any Equityholder specifically, Acquiror shall provide notice to
the Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholder(s), which
notice shall be deemed having been provided to such Equityholder(s). During
the Escrow Period, at the time an Acquiror Indemnified Party gives, or at any
time after an Acquiror Indemnified Party gives, the
Equityholder Representative written notice of such Acquiror Indemnified
Partys indemnification claim hereunder, Acquiror may make a written claim
against the Escrow Fund (a " _Claim_ ") by delivering written notice of the
same (the " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent as more particularly
provided in the Escrow Agreement (in which event Acquiror will provide a copy
of such Claim Notice to the Equityholder Representative). Subject to the
limitations and procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, upon receipt of
a Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent will, segregate from the Escrow Fund into a
separate account (the " _Pending Claims Account_ ") a portion of the Escrow
Fund as necessary to satisfy and pay the amount of the Claim as stated in the
Claim Notice. The Escrow Agent will distribute the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) Each notice of a claim by the Acquiror given pursuant to _ Section_ __ _
8_ shall contain the following information:

 



58

    

(i) that Acquiror or another Acquiror Indemnified Party has incurred, paid,
sustained or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will incur, pay,
sustain or accrue, Losses in an aggregate stated amount arising from such
claim (which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in
an action brought against any Acquiror Indemnified Party based on alleged
facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Losses to such Acquiror
Indemnified Party under this _ Section 8_); and

 

(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Acquiror), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
such Losses based on Acquirors good faith belief thereof, including (x) the
basis for such anticipated liability and the nature of the breach to which
such Losses are related, (y) the identity of any third party claimant and (z)
copies of any formal demand or complaint from any third party claimant.

(c) No delay on the part of Acquiror in giving the Equityholder
Representative a notice of a Claim shall relieve the Equityholder
Representative or any Equityholder from any of their respective obligations
under this _ Section 8_ unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Equityholder Representative or the Equityholders are materially prejudiced
thereby in terms of the amount of Losses for which the Equityholders are
obligated to indemnify the Acquiror Indemnified Party.

 

(d) In the event that any Action shall be instituted or that any claim or
demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which payment may
be sought under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ hereof (regardless of the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ hereof) (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the
indemnified party shall as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten
(10) days after such Third-Party Claim has been initiated or after the
indemnified party receives written notice of the Third-Party Claim, cause
written notice of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ hereof to be forwarded to
the indemnifying party, provided that if the Equityholders are the
indemnifying party, such notice shall be forwarded to the Equityholder
Representative. The failure of the indemnified party to give timely notice of
any Third-Party Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying party can reasonably demonstrate actual loss or
prejudice as a result of such failure and then only to the extent of such loss
or prejudice. Regardless of which party is the indemnifying party, Acquiror
shall have the right, at the sole expense of the indemnifying party, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder. The Equityholder Representative, on behalf of
the Equityholders, may participate in, but not control, the defense of Third
Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Equityholder, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except with the consent of the Equityholder Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood
and agreed that it shall be reasonable for the Equityholder Representative to
withhold consent to any requested settlement if the
Equityholder Representative believes in good faith that there is no
underlying basis for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ with respect
to such settlement), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third
party claimants shall be determinative of the indemnification obligations (if
any) of the Equityholders hereunder or the amount of Losses relating to such
matter; _provided_ _further_ , however, that the consent of the Equityholder
Representative with respect to any settlement of any such Third Party Claim
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Equityholder Representative
shall have objected within 30 days after a written request for such consent by
parent. If the indemnified party defends any Third-Party Claim, then the
indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of
defending such Third-Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. The
parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no assertions made
by any indemnified party in defense of a Third-Party Claim shall be considered
in any determination of indemnification rights under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

 



59

    

(e) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third-Party Claim
hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be
required to pay all of such sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ hereof; _provided_ , _however,_ that the
indemnified party may not settle, or consent to entry of a judgment of, a
Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the indemnifying party.

8.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_. With respect to indemnification claims
brought against any Equityholder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8_:

(a) The Equityholders maximum aggregate liability with respect to
claims arising out of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_, other than as otherwise
expressly set forth herein, shall be limited to the Indemnification Escrow;
provided, that with respect to claims based upon the IP Representations,
the Equityholders maximum aggregate liability shall be an amount equal to
$20,000,000 (inclusive of any claims based upon the IP Representations
otherwise satisfied out of the Indemnification Escrow); provided, further that
with respect to claims based upon the Fundamental Representations or fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, each of the
Equityholders maximum aggregate liability (on a cumulative basis) shall be
such Equityholders Percentage of the Net Merger Consideration actually
received by such Equityholder (other than claims based on fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct of an Equityholder for which there
shall be no limit on liability with respect to such Equityholder). 

(b) The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall not have the right to be
indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ (excluding with respect to
the Fundamental Representations, fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful misconduct) unless and until the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall
have incurred, on a cumulative basis following the Closing, Losses in excess
of an amount equal to $1,050,000 (the " _Basket_ ") in which event the right
to be indemnified shall apply to all Losses (i.e., inclusive of the amount of
the Basket).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Equityholders liability for Losses based upon, arising out of, relating to
or resulting from (i) any VDA Proceeding, (ii) the Dutch Returns or (iii) the
other Tax Returns contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(f)_ shall be limited,
in the aggregate to the sum of (A) $50,000 and (B) fifty percent (50%) of the
amount of such Losses in excess of $50,000.

8.6 _Indemnity Payments_. Any payment that any Equityholder is obligated to
make to any Acquiror Indemnified Parties, or that Acquiror is obligated to
make to any Equityholder Indemnified Parties, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8_ shall be paid by the Equityholders or Acquiror by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) days after the date notice of any
sums due and owing is delivered to Agent by Acquiror or to Acquiror by Agent
(the " _Indemnity Payment Period_ ").

 



60

    

8.7 _Procedures for Claims Against, and Distributions of, Funds Deposited with
the Escrow Agent_.

(a) _Claims_. Each Claim Notice given by the Acquiror shall be resolved as
follows:

 

(i) _Uncontested Claims_. If, within 30 days after a Claim Notice is received
by the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder Representative does not
contest such Claim Notice in writing to Acquiror as provided in _ Section_ __
_ 8.7(a)(ii)_, the Equityholder Representative shall be conclusively deemed
to have consented, on behalf of all Equityholders, to the recovery by the
Acquiror Indemnified Party of the full amount of Losses specified in the Claim
Notice in accordance with this _ Section 8_, including the forfeiture of
Escrow Fund.

 

(ii) _Contested Claims_. If the Equityholder Representative gives Acquiror
written notice contesting all or any portion of a Claim Notice (such disputed
portion, a " _Contested Claim_ ") (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) within the
30-day period specified in _ Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)(i)_, then such Contested
Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed
by Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative (a copy of which shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent) or (ii) in the absence of such a
written settlement agreement within 30 days following receipt by Acquiror of
the written notice from the Equityholder Representative, by binding litigation
between Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative in accordance with the
terms and provisions of _ Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)(iii)_.

(iii) _Litigation of Contested Claims_. Either Acquiror or the
Equityholder Representative may bring suit in the courts specified in _
Section_ __ _ 10.3_ to resolve the Contested Claim. The decision of the trial
court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Notice shall be
non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and
make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.

(b)  _Final Distribution_. On the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, following receipt by the Escrow Agent of a joint written
instruction executed by Acquiror and the Equityholder Representative, the
Indemnification Escrow, less all amounts then segregated in a Pending Claims
Account, will be eligible for distribution based upon each Equityholders
Percentage.

 

(c) Any amounts required to be paid by the Equityholders to an Acquiror
Indemnified Party pursuant to a claim for indemnification pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8_ for which the Equityholders are severally liable in
proportion to their respective Percentage (excluding any claims for
indemnification made against a specific Equityholder for any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty of, or for the breach or non-
fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation required be performed by,
such specific Equityholder) shall be first satisfied from the Indemnification
Escrow, in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement, until
the Indemnification Escrow is reduced to $0.00 (due to the release of such
funds pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ or otherwise), and thereafter,
such amounts shall be payable directly by the Equityholders (subject to the
limitations set forth herein, to the extent applicable) in proportion to their
respective Percentages. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances
(other than solely with respect to claims for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by a specified Equityholder) will any
individual Equityholder be subject to indemnification for Losses under this
Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of the Net Merger Consideration
actually received by such Equityholder (plus, with respect to any individual
Equityholder, such Equityholders Percentage of the Escrow Amount and Expense
Fund).

 



61

    

8.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Company, the Equityholders and
Acquiror agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8_ as an adjustment to the Net Merger Consideration for federal, state,
local and foreign income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Law.

 

8.9 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 8_ shall (i) not include any
special or punitive damages (except in each case to the extent such damages
shall actually be awarded to a third party and be payable by an Acquiror
Indemnified Party) and (ii) be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (net
of any costs of such recovery such as increased premiums, deductibles and
self-insured amounts) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually recovered by the Acquiror Indemnified Party from any third party
with respect thereto. In the event that an insurance or other recovery from a
third party is made by any Acquiror Indemnified Party with respect to the
specific Losses for which any such Person has received an indemnification
payment hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery (net of any costs of such recovery such as increased premiums,
deductibles and self-insured amounts) shall be made promptly to (a) the Escrow
Agent for replenishment of the Escrow Fund, if during the General Survival
Period, or (b) the Paying Agent if after the expiration of the General
Survival Period, for distribution to the Equityholders, and the portion of
such amount owed to each Equityholders will be determined in accordance with
its respective Percentage (less Taxes withheld, if any, pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.15_).

8.10  _Exclusive Monetary Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct, after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8_ shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy and recourse for monetary damages of
the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses or other claims
relating to or arising from this Agreement.

 

9\. _The Equityholder Representative._

 

9.1 _Appointment of the Equityholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of their approval of the Merger, or participating in the Merger
and receiving the benefits thereof, each Equityholder hereby appoints (or
will be deemed to have designated and appointed) the Equityholder
Representative as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact of the
Equityholders with full power and authority to act for and on behalf of each
Equityholder for all purposes in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including to give and receive
notices and communications under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to
administer the Expense Fund and pay any and all third-party expenses of the
Equityholder Representative incurred in furtherance of its duties hereunder,
to accept service of process on behalf of the Equityholder pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.3,_ _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and the Escrow Agreement, as
applicable, to authorize and agree to any post-closing adjustments or any
other applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with judgments of courts or other Governmental Authorities and awards of
arbitrators, with respect to, any claims by any Acquiror Indemnified Party
against any Equityholder or by any Equityholder against

 



62

    

 any Acquiror Indemnified Party, or any other dispute between any Acquiror
Indemnified Party and any Equityholder, in each case relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Transaction Documents and to take all
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Equityholder Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement (ii)
permitted or specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equityholder
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Equityholders,
except as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the
Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity,
there are no obligations of the Equityholder Representative in any ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure Schedule. After the
Closing, notices or communications to or from the Equityholder Representative
constitute notice to or from each of the Equityholder for all purposes under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement:

 

(b) The Equityholder Representative may resign at any time. In the event of
the resignation, death or incapacity of the Equityholder Representative, a
successor Equityholder Representative will be elected promptly by the
Equityholders whose interests aggregate not less than a majority of the
Percentage of the Net Merger Consideration allocable to all Equityholders and
the Equityholders will so notify Acquiror. Each successor Equityholder
Representative has all of the power, authority, rights and privileges
conferred by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement upon the original
Equityholder Representative, and the term "Equityholder Representative" as
used in this Agreement includes any successor Equityholder Representative. The
immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Equityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory
Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(c) A decision, act, instruction or Consent of the Equityholder
Representative constitutes a decision, act, instruction or Consent of all the
Equityholders for purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement and is final, binding and
conclusive upon the Equityholders and their successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by the Equityholders and any Acquiror
Indemnified Party may rely upon any such decision, act, instruction or Consent
of the Equityholder Representative as being the decision, act, instruction or
Consent of the Equityholders. All defenses which may be available to any
Equityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Equityholder
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. Acquiror
is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done or
omissions by Acquiror in accordance with such decision, act, instruction or
Consent of the Equityholder Representative. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Acquiror is entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon any
document delivered by the Equityholder Representative as being genuine and
correct and having been duly signed or sent by the Equityholder
Representative. The Equityholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Payment Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Equityholder or other party.

 

(d) Certain Equityholders have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Equityholder
Representative to provide direction to the Equityholder Representative in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement (such Equityholders,
including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred
to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Equityholder Representative nor
its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,

 



63

    

 agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
" _Equityholder Representative Group_ "), will incur liability of any kind
with respect to any action or omission by the Equityholder Representative
Group in connection with its services pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Equityholder Representatives gross negligence, intentional
or willful misconduct or fraud. The Equityholder Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Equityholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equityholder
Representative Group from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, judgments, amounts paid in settlement fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and other skilled professionals and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Equityholder Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Equityholder Representative Engagement Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused
by the gross negligence, intentional or willful misconduct or fraud of the
Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder Representative will reimburse
the Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence, intentional or willful
misconduct or fraud. If not paid directly to the Equityholder Representative
by the Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Equityholder Representative from (i) the Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts in
the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Equityholders; _provided_ , that while this section
allows the Equityholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Equityholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Equityholder Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Equityholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the Equityholders or otherwise. Furthermore, the Equityholder Representative
shall not be required to take any action unless the Equityholder
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its determination, are sufficient to protect the Equityholder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Equityholder Representative in performing such actions. Upon the Closing, the
Acquiror will wire the Expense Fund to the Equityholder Representative to be
held by it in a segregated client funds account and which will be used for
the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Equityholder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto or as otherwise directed by the Advisory
Group. The Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Equityholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Equityholder Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Equityholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Equityholder Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Subject to Advisory
Group approval, the Equityholder Representative may contribute funds to the
Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Equityholder Representatives responsibilities, the Equityholder
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the
Paying Agent for further distribution to the Equityholders. For tax purposes,
the

 



64

    

 Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Equityholders at the time of Closing. For clarity, no Acquiror
Indemnified Party shall have any liability with respect to the Expense Fund,
including with respect to the distribution, investment, holding and
disposition thereof.

(e) The Equityholder Representative shall have reasonable access to
information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of
the Companys former officers and employees for purposes of performing its
duties and exercising its rights hereunder; _ provided, that,_ the
Equityholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or disclose
the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or about the
Surviving Corporation to anyone (except to the Equityholder or the
Equityholder Representatives employees, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors or authorized representatives, including the Advisory Group, on a
need to know basis, in each case who agree to treat such
information confidentially); _ provided, however_, that neither the Acquiror
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to provide such access or
information if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege. The Equityholder
Representative shall enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement
prior to being provided access to such information if reasonably requested by
the Acquiror.

 

(f) This appointment and grant of power and authority and the immunities and
rights to indemnification granted by the Equityholders to the Equityholder
Representative Group pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ are coupled with an
interest, are in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement,
are irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any Equityholder or
by operation of Law, whether upon the death or incapacity of any Equityholder,
or by the occurrence of any other event, shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Equityholder
of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

10\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

10.1 _Successors and Assigns_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder
shall be assigned in whole or in part by any party thereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that Acquiror
may assign any or all of its rights, obligations and interests hereunder to
any Affiliate of Acquiror without any such written consent but with notice
to the Equityholder Representative so long as Acquiror shall remain primarily
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder. The terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the respective successors and assigns of the parties. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than
the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement,
except (i) as expressly provided in this Agreement and (ii) the Equityholder
Representative will be permitted to enforce the terms of this Agreement
following the Closing on behalf of the Company and the Equityholders.

10.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all matters arising directly or
indirectly hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts made and performed
in such State without giving effect to the choice of law or conflict of law
principles of such state that would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction.

 



65

    

10.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_ _; Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

(a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any federal or state court located within the State of Delaware over any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related
thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
other party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery
of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.6_.

 

(c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS
THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY
COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

10.8 _Attorney s Fees_. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of any of the Transaction Agreements, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
necessary disbursements in addition to any other relief to which such party

each of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns.

10.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

10.11 _Delays or Omissions_. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power
or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or
default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right,
power or remedy of such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor
shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party
of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of
any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in
writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in
such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise
afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

10.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedules hereto) constitute the full and entire understanding and

any other written or oral agreement relating to the subject matter hereof
existing between the parties are expressly canceled.

 

10.13 _Joint Negotiation and Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



68

    

10.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage could
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
The parties accordingly agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties are entitled to seek
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement. Each party expressly
waives any requirement that any other party obtain any bond or provide any
indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive relief or specific
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement. Acquiror and Merger Sub
acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ may be enforced by the
Equityholder Representative following the Closing on behalf the Company and
the Equityholders.

10.15 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding that the Company has been represented by Cooley LLP (the "
_Firm_ ") in the preparation, negotiation and execution of the Transaction
Agreements, each of Acquiror and the Company agrees that after the Closing,
the Firm may represent the Equityholder Representative, Equityholders and/or
their Affiliates in all matters related to the Transaction Agreements,
including in respect of any indemnification claims pursuant to the Transaction
Agreements. Each of Acquiror and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and
has obtained information relevant to such representation, including
disclosure of the reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such
representation, and it hereby waives any conflict arising out of such future
representation.

 

(b) Each of Acquiror and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that the Firm has represented the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. Such parties agree that
any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection and
expectation of client confidence attaching to any communications involving
attorney-client confidences between the Firm and the Company solely in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the evaluation
of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and the negotiation,
documentation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements (the " _Pre-Signing Communications_"), and all Pre-
Signing Communications shall, after the Closing, belong to and be controlled
solely by the Equityholders, and may only be waived by the Equityholder
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders. To the extent that Acquiror or
the Company receives or takes physical possession of any Pre-Signing
Communications after the Closing, such physical possession or receipt shall
not, in any way, be deemed a waiver by the Affiliates or the Equityholder, or
any other Person, of the privileges or protections described in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.15_.

(c) In the event that a dispute arises between: (i) Acquiror or the Company;
and (ii) a third party other than the Equityholders, Acquiror or the Company
may in their sole discretion: (A) assert attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of privileged materials to such third party by the Firm and the
Firm shall not disclose such information; or (B) waive such privilege.
