consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements and covenants
hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, TXU Gas and LSG
hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  DEFINITIONS   SECTION 1.01. Defined

Construction.   (a) References. The words "hereby," "herein,"

operation, installation and replacement of pipelines or any facilities of TXU

set forth in Section 4.06 and Section 4.07, at Closing, the total amount of
cash of LSG equal to the LSG Merger Assets shall be allocated to, be
possessed by, and vest in TXU Gas.   SECTION 3.04. LSG Excluded Assets and
LSG Retained Liabilities. All of the real estate and other property of LSG
that is not designated as LSG Merger Assets (the "LSG Excluded Assets") shall
continue to be possessed by and vested in LSG, and all of the liabilities and
obligations of LSG, whether arising or accruing prior to or after the
Effective Time (the "LSG Retained Liabilities"), shall continue to be
liabilities and obligations of LSG, all without further act or deed. No
liabilities or obligations of LSG shall be allocated to or assumed by TXU Gas
in the Merger. IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT THE
MERGER SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ANY OF THE REAL ESTATE, OTHER
PROPERTY, LIABILITIES OR OBLIGATIONS OF LSG NOT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED AS
LSG MERGER ASSETS.   SECTION 3.05. Status and Conversion of Securities. By
virtue of the Merger and without further act or deed on the part of any of
the Parties:   (a) TXU Gas. At the Effective Time, each share of the
capital stock of TXU Gas issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the
Effective Time.   (b) LSG. At the Effective Time, each share of the
capital stock of LSG issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the
Effective Time.   SECTION 3.06. Dissenters\' Rights; Redemption. (a) Each of
TXU Gas and LSG, as the Surviving Companies of the Merger, agree to be liable
for the payment of the fair value of any shares held by their respective
shareholders who comply with Article 5.12 of the Texas Law relating to the
rights of a dissenting shareholder.   (b) On the Closing Date, TXU Gas
shall call for redemption all of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series F, and shall thereafter retain sufficient cash to pay the full
redemption price thereof in accordance with the terms of such shares.    
6     SECTION 3.07. Consents to Assignment. This Agreement does
not constitute an agreement to assign a particular asset, right-of-way,
easement, contract, agreement, Permit or Environmental Permit constituting
TXU Gas Merger Assets or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom, except as represented and warranted herein. To the
extent that the Closing of the Merger would cause TXU Gas to be in violation
of a licensing or other law or of any prohibition on assignment of that
particular TXU Gas Merger Asset (herein called a "Transfer Requirement"),
which is represented and warranted herein to be required or as to which no
such representation or warranty is required herein, TXU Gas and LSG will use
Reasonable Efforts to obtain before Closing all consents, waivers,
authorizations and approvals that may be asserted by any Person to be
required to permit the Closing of the Merger or the allocation of the TXU Gas
Merger Assets, or any claim or right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom, without violating such Transfer Requirement.
Nevertheless, if despite such Reasonable Efforts, TXU Gas is unable to
satisfy such Transfer Requirement asserted by any Person to be applicable
to the Closing of the Merger or necessary for the allocation of any such TXU
Gas Merger Asset, or any claim or right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom by Closing then: (a) from and after the Closing, TXU Gas
will deliver to LSG the revenues and other benefits from, and pay the costs
and expenses required to be paid with respect to, such TXU Gas Merger Asset,
(b) LSG will reimburse TXU Gas for or discharge TXU Gas\' obligations to the
extent they are TXU Gas Merger Liabilities with respect to such TXU Gas
Merger Asset, (c) upon LSG\'s written request, TXU Gas will enforce for the
benefit of LSG at LSG\'s sole cost and expense, any and all rights of TXU Gas
against a third party with respect to such TXU Gas Merger Asset, and (d) LSG
will indemnify and hold TXU Gas harmless with respect to any TXU Gas Merger
Liabilities arising with respect to such TXU Gas Merger Asset, except to the
extent resulting from TXU Gas\' gross negligence, willful misconduct or
breach of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.07 is intended to satisfy
any closing condition in Section 8.01.   ARTICLE IV  MERGER CONSIDERATION;
CLOSING; ADJUSTMENTS   SECTION 4.01. Acknowledgement of Consideration for
Merger. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the manner and basis of
allocating and vesting the real estate, other property, liabilities and
obligations of TXU Gas and LSG, as set forth in Article III, are sufficient
and adequate consideration for each such Party with respect to the
Merger.   SECTION 4.02. Closing. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m.
at the offices of Hunton and Williams LLP, 1601 Bryan Street, 30th Floor,
Dallas, Texas 75201 on the first (1st) business day of the first month that
is at least five (5) business days after all of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 (other than the conditions to be
satisfied on such day) have been satisfied. The date on which the Closing

Accounting Referee) that the amount of the Final Working Capital is less than
the amount set forth in the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital,
as revised prior to the Closing, then TXU Gas shall pay to LSG an amount
equal to the difference between the Preliminary Working Capital and the Final
Working Capital. In the event that it is finally resolved pursuant to Section

the amount set forth in the Preliminary Statement of Working Capital, as
revised prior to the Closing, then LSG shall pay to TXU Gas an amount equal
to the difference between the Preliminary Working Capital and the Final
Working Capital. Any payment required to be made by TXU Gas or LSG hereunder

Agreement"), the provisions of which are incorporated into this Section 7.03
by reference and accepted and agreed to by LSG. If Closing occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon Closing.   (b) Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by LSG, for a period commencing on the Closing
Date and terminating two (2) years after such date, TXU Gas shall (i) keep
all confidential information of TXU Gas that relates to the Business

purchasing history and natural gas requirements of the distribution customers
of the Business) confidential and not disclose or reveal any such information
to any Person other than its representatives who are actively and directly
participating in the transactions contemplated hereby and who need to know
such information for such purpose and to cause those Persons and each
of their Affiliates to observe the terms of this Section 7.03(b) and (ii)
except as set forth herein, not use, or permit any Affiliate to use, such
information for the transportation or distribution of natural gas to

that Affiliates of TXU Gas are currently engaged in the distribution and sale
of electricity to many common customers of the Business, and use of
information by an Affiliate for electric sales or distribution is not
intended to be     21    restricted. Also, Affiliates of TXU Gas are
engaged in various wholesale gas trading and sales activities with respect to
large industrial or commercial customers, and the terms hereof do not
restrict the use of information for those purposes. In furtherance of the
foregoing, but not by way of limitation, during such period TXU Gas shall
not, directly or indirectly, cause or attempt to cause any of the customers
or suppliers of the Business to terminate or materially reduce their business
with the Business or LSG or any of its Affiliates. TXU Gas shall continue to
hold all such information according to the same internal security procedures
and with the same degree of care regarding its secrecy and confidentiality as

filings with, and to give all notices to, Governmental Authorities, including
those required filings set forth on Schedule 6.04(b), required to accomplish
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) This Agreement is
subject in all respects to, and conditioned upon compliance by the Parties
with, the HSR Act, to the extent that the HSR Act is applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall make any
filings required under the HSR Act on or prior to fifteen (15) days after the
date hereof and provide such information to the FTC and DOJ as is required in
connection with the HSR Act as soon as practicable after a request
therefor.   (c) Each of the Parties will (i) use Reasonable Efforts
to comply as expeditiously as possible with all lawful requests of
Governmental Authorities for additional information and documents pursuant to
the HSR Act, (ii) not (A) extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or (B)
enter into any voluntary agreement with any Governmental Authority not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the
prior consent of the other Party, and (iii) cooperate with each other and use
Reasonable Efforts to obtain the requisite approval of the FTC and DOJ,
including without limitation (A) the removal, dissolution, stay or dismissal
of any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other judicial
or administrative order which prevents the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (B) the pursuit of necessary administrative, court and
other proceedings through, but not past, the trial court level).   (d) LSG
and TXU Gas will each be responsible for paying one-half the filing fees
required with respect to any filing under the HSR Act.   SECTION 7.05.
Employment of Employees by LSG.   (a) Offers of Employment. Prior to
Closing, TXU Gas will cause its Affiliates to transfer to TXU Gas the
employees employed by such Affiliates but primarily    
22    dedicated to TXU Gas. Prior to Closing, TXU Gas\' Affiliates shall
transfer to TXU Gas such employees not to exceed 125, as shall be consented
to by LSG prior to such transfer, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld. As of the Effective Time and in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, LSG will offer to employ all employees of TXU
Gas, including those transferred to TXU Gas pursuant to the preceding
sentence (the "Transitioned Employees") who either are actively at work or
are on vacation or bereavement leave. The effective date of LSG\'s offer of
employment shall be each such Transitioned Employee\'s "Employment
Commencement Date". All such offers of employment by LSG shall be
unconditional, and LSG shall employ all Transitioned Employees who accept
such offer of employment effective as of the applicable Employment
Commencement Date. TXU Gas will terminate the employment of each Transitioned
Employee who receives an offer of employment by LSG, such transition to be
effective as of such Transitioned Employee\'s Employment Commencement Date.
LSG agrees that the initial positions and base salaries of the Transitioned
Employees who are employed by LSG will be comparable to the positions and
base salaries held by such employees at TXU Gas immediately prior to the
Closing, and that such base salaries shall not be reduced for a period of at
least one year after the Closing Date. The other terms of employment
and employee benefit plans applicable for the Transitioned Employees who
are employed by LSG shall be comparable to similarly situated LSG (or
its Affiliates\') non-union gas utility employees, provided that: (i) except
as otherwise provided herein, each Transitioned Employee employed by LSG (and
where applicable such Transitioned Employee\'s dependents and beneficiaries)
will be eligible immediately to participate in all employee benefit plans of
LSG for which such Transitioned Employee is eligible by virtue of his/her
employment by LSG without any waiting period; and (ii) each such Transitioned
Employee who signs, in a timely manner, an Agreement and Release in the form
attached as Schedule 7.05(a) to this Agreement or such other forms as TXU Gas
shall require ("Agreement and Release"), shall be entitled to the rights and
benefits provided for under Sections 7.05(c) (relating to a minimum retention
period), 7.05(d) (relating to the crediting of years of service for certain
employee benefit plan purposes), and 7.05(g) (relating to special severance
benefits). TXU Gas will notify LSG in writing of each Transitioned Employee
who signs the Agreement and Release in a timely manner.   (b) On-Leave
Transitioned Employees. With respect to any Transitioned Employee who is on
leave status, including medical (FMLA or otherwise), disability, salary
continuation, sick leave, or other leave of absence, which has been approved
by TXU Gas or is contemplated under its policies, such employee shall remain
an employee of TXU Gas until such employee returns to work or his/her
employment is otherwise terminated. If any such employee returns to work
within six (6) months after the Closing Date, LSG shall promptly extend an
offer of employment to such employee on the terms and conditions of
employment described in this Section 7.05, and TXU at the same time shall
terminate the employment of such employee. If any such employee does not
return within such six (6) month period, LSG shall be under no obligation
to offer employment to such employee, and such employee shall no longer be
a Transitioned Employee hereunder.   (c) Minimum Retention. LSG shall not
terminate any Transitioned Employee employed by LSG who signs the Agreement
and Release for a period of at least ninety (90) days following the
Transitioned Employee\'s Employment Commencement Date for any reason
other     23    than "cause." For purposes of this provision, "cause"
shall mean intentional or gross disregard of a material LSG rule or policy
relating to employee conduct, or gross misconduct resulting, in either case,
in material harm to LSG, or conviction for a felony or other crime involving
moral turpitude.   (d) Years of Service Credit. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 7.05(l), each Transitioned Employee employed by LSG who signs
the Agreement and Release shall receive service credit by LSG for all
such Transitioned Employee\'s service, which was recognized by TXU Gas or
its Affiliates, or by an employee plan of TXU Gas or its Affiliates, for
purposes of vesting, participation, eligibility for benefits, (other than
eligibility for retiree medical benefits), benefit accrual (other than
benefit accrual for retiree medical benefits), optional forms of payment, and
any other right, benefit or feature applicable to Transitioned Employees
under each employee benefit plan, program and policy of LSG. For purposes of
LSG\'s Pension Account Plan, "benefit accrual" shall refer only to the
plan\'s annual allocation based on age, benefit service and eligible pay and
shall not refer to opening balance credits, additional annual pay credits or
transitional benefits under said Plan.   (e) Special Provisions Applicable
to Employee Welfare Benefit Plans. In addition to the provisions set forth
above relating to employee benefit plans generally applicable to Transitioned
Employees employed by LSG, LSG shall, or shall cause its insurance carrier(s)
to: (i) waive all pre-existing condition limitations, waiting periods,
insurability requirements or similar limitations relating to any employee
welfare benefit plan so that each Transitioned Employee will be fully
eligible to participate in each welfare benefit plan of LSG as of Closing;
and (ii) grant credit toward applicable deductibles attained for each
Transitioned Employee under the comparable plan of TXU Gas or its Affiliates
for the year of the Closing. As soon as reasonably practical following the
Closing Date, TXU Gas shall deliver to LSG a list of such Transitioned
Employees participating in each welfare benefit plan, together with each such
Transitioned Employee\'s co-payment, deductible and out-of-pocket payment
amounts under each such plan.   (f) Special Provisions Relating to LSG
401(k) Plan. In addition to the provisions set forth above relating to
employee benefit plans generally applicable to Transitioned Employees
employed by LSG, LSG shall insure that its 401(k) plan shall permit, in
accordance with applicable law, direct trustee-to-trustee transfers and
rollovers, as contemplated under Section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code
of such Transitioned Employees\' TXU Thrift Plan account balances, including
all outstanding loans made under such plan. To the extent that rollover
amounts consist of outstanding loans, TXU Gas shall cause the trustee of the
TXU Thrift Plan also to transfer to the trustee of the LSG 401(k) plan the
promissory notes, payroll deduction authorizations for installment loan
payments and related documents evidencing such loans.   (g) Severance Plan.
With respect to each Transitioned Employee employed by LSG who signs the
Agreement and Release, LSG shall, in addition to the special terms provided
for herein, provide such Transitioned Employee with severance benefits at
least equal to those benefits set forth in Schedule 7.05(g), in the event
that LSG terminates such     24    Transitioned Employee following the
ninetieth (90th) day of, and within the eighteen (18) month period after, the
Closing for any reason other than cause (as defined above).   (h) Employee
Appliance Purchase and Energy Conservation Programs. LSG acknowledges that
with respect to each Transitioned Employee employed by LSG who at the time of
Closing is participating in the TXU Gas programs providing employee purchase
assistance and financing for energy-efficient household appliances through
payroll withholding by TXU Gas of payments under such programs, LSG shall
continue such payroll withholding on the same terms and conditions and shall
periodically transmit the amounts so withheld to the appropriate parties as
provided for under such programs. TXU Gas will deliver all documents and
endorse all such appliance-program notes in favor of LSG.   (i) LSG
Acknowledgement. LSG acknowledges that the terms of this Agreement as they
apply to Transitioned Employees employed by LSG who executes the Agreement
and Release are being relied upon, in part, by such Transitioned Employees
and TXU Gas as consideration for the Agreement and Release.   (j)
Transitioned Employee Data. Prior to the date hereof, TXU Gas has delivered
to LSG a list of the persons who would have been Transitioned Employees had
the Closing Date occurred on June 1, 2004, showing the following information
for each such person: (i) the name of each employee and date of birth; (ii)
the name of his or her current employer; (iii) his or her current base
salary; (iv) his or her hire date, any rehire date (if applicable) and years
of service credit for the purposes set forth in Section 7.05(c); (v) his or
her then-current position and job title; and (vi) whether such employee is
on authorized leave of absence and the general nature of such leave of
absence. TXU Gas shall update such list periodically prior to the Closing
Date, in each case assuming the Closing had occurred on such date, and shall
deliver such updated lists to LSG.   (k) Flexible Benefits Plan Transfers.
As soon as reasonably practical following the Closing Date, TXU Gas shall
cause the transfer to LSG\'s flexible benefits plan any credit balance in the
dependent care spending account under TXU Gas\' cafeteria plan of any
Transitioned Employee employed by LSG and the net aggregate credit or debit
balance in the health care spending accounts under TXU Gas\' cafeteria plan
of all Transitioned Employees employed by LSG. On the Closing Date, TXU Gas
shall provide to LSG a list of Transitioned Employees employed by LSG who
have elected to participate in the health care or dependent care spending
accounts under the cafeteria plan maintained by TXU Gas, together with such
employees\' elections made prior to the Closing Date with respect to such
accounts, and balances standing to their credit or debit as of the
Closing Date, and a statement of aggregate expenses reimbursed from the plan
for each such Transferred Employee during the current plan year. LSG agrees
to administer such accounts (consistent with the terms of the flexible
benefits plan applicable to LSG\'s employees) such that such Transferred
Employees will be able to defer compensation (in accordance with the terms of
the applicable LSG plan) and to submit claims against such accounts within
the time period permitted by applicable law.     25     (l) Retiree
Medical Asset Transfer. In the event TXU Gas and LSG shall mutually agree, in
lieu of excluding Transitioned Employees\' service credit for eligibility and
benefit accrual for retiree medical benefits as provided for in Section
7.05(d), each Transitioned Employee employed by LSG who signs the Agreement
and Release shall receive service credit by LSG for all such Transitioned
Employee\'s service which was recognized by the retiree medical plans of TXU
Gas or its Affiliates for eligibility for retiree medical benefits and
benefit accrual for retiree medical benefits. If service credit is
received as provided in this Section 7.05(l), then as soon as possible
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 30 days following the
later of the Closing Date or other establishment of any necessary LSG Post-
Retirement Trusts (as defined below), TXU Gas shall cause the amount
calculated as provided herein to be transferred to LSG, through the transfer
from the trusts or other vehicles ("TXU Gas Post-Retirement Trusts") funding
the post-retirement medical benefits (the "Post-Retirement Benefits")
provided by TXU Gas for all Transitioned Employees to the trust or trusts
established or maintained by or for the benefit of LSG employees ("LSG Post-
Retirement Trusts") for the funding of post-retirement medical benefits. The
amount to be transferred shall be equal to the amount of the accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation for the Transitioned Employees which has
been funded under the TXU Gas Post-Retirement Trusts, as determined by the
actuaries for TXU Gas in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, and reviewed by LSG\'s actuaries. TXU Gas agrees to
provide LSG with the necessary information for its actuaries to calculate the
initial accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the Transitioned
Employees on the basis of (i) each Transitioned Employee\'s actual age and
appropriate service as of the Closing Date, and (ii) the benefits
and contribution levels as in effect as of the Closing Date applicable to
LSG\'s active employees retiring after the closing date under LSG\'s plan
providing Post-Retirement Benefits.   SECTION 7.06. Affiliate Agreements.
Before Closing, TXU Gas may enter into the agreements and other arrangements
with its Affiliates related to the shared use of certain facilities and
shared services, all as described in Schedule 7.06.   SECTION 7.07. Books
and Records: Access to Employees. Each of TXU Gas and LSG shall make
available to the other Party and its representatives, information and
employees of such Party necessary or reasonably deemed desirable by such
Party in preparing its Tax Returns, financial statements, conducting
any audits in connection therewith, and asserting or defending any
Claims.   SECTION 7.08. Further Assurances; License. (a) At the Closing and
from time to time after the Closing: (i) TXU Gas, at the reasonable request
of LSG and without further consideration, shall promptly execute and deliver
to LSG such certificates and other instruments of sale, conveyance,
assignment and transfer, and take such other action as may reasonably be
requested by LSG to more effectively sell, convey, assign and transfer title
to and vest title in LSG or to put LSG in possession of the TXU Gas Merger
Assets, and (ii) LSG, at the request of TXU Gas and without further
consideration, shall promptly execute and deliver to TXU Gas such
certificates and other instruments of assumption, and take such other action,
as may reasonably be requested by TXU Gas, to more effectively confirm and
effect the assumption by LSG of the TXU Gas Merger Liabilities.    
26     (b) Provided that such use does not interfere with the business of
TXU Gas\' Affiliates, and subject to the applicable Affiliate\'s written
consent which may not be unreasonably withheld (but which may be conditioned
upon the provision of insurance coverage and other customary terms of use),
TXU Gas shall cause each of its Affiliates to grant to LSG a non-exclusive,
perpetual, paid-up, limited license to use any right-of-way or easement,
whether or not currently in writing or recorded, upon which their respective
assets are located or upon which pipelines, pipes, gas lines, or other
facilities of LSG as a surviving company are located, for the continued use,
operation and replacement of such pipelines, pipes, gas lines and
other facilities of TXU Gas currently located on such properties.   SECTION
7.09. Notices of Certain Events. LSG and TXU Gas shall each promptly notify
the other Party hereto of:   (a) any written notice from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   (b) any written notice from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the TXU Gas Merger Assets;   (c) any Claim commenced
or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to, or involving or
otherwise affecting such Party that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to any provision
of this Agreement, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and   (d) any of the following: (i) the
discovery by such Party that any representation or warranty of any Party
contained in this Agreement is untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or (ii) the occurrence or failure to occur of any event which occurrence or
failure to occur would be likely to cause any of the representations or
warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or incorrect in any material
respect as of the date made, and (iii) any material failure on its part to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder.   SECTION 7.10. Casualty Loss or
Condemnation.   (a) If, before Closing, any party of the TXU Gas Merger
Assets are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, or if any part of
the TXU Gas Merger Assets are condemned, or if proceedings are filed for
condemnation or under the right of eminent domain, the result of which will
have a Material Adverse Effect (any of such being a "Casualty"), TXU Gas will
promptly inform LSG. As soon as practicable following any Casualty, TXU Gas
will provide to LSG a detailed written estimate from an independent third
party appraiser mutually acceptable to TXU Gas and LSG ("Casualty Estimate")
setting forth the estimated amount required to repair or replace the damaged
TXU Gas Merger Asset and the estimated time period for completion of such
repair or replacement.     27   (b) Concurrently with the delivery of a
Casualty Estimate, TXU Gas will notify LSG whether TXU Gas elects: (i) to
repair or replace the damaged TXU Gas Merger Asset, or (ii) to offer to
accept a reduction in the LSG Merger Assets by an amount equal to the
Casualty Estimate. TXU Gas will have no obligation to repair the damaged TXU
Gas Merger Asset as a result of such Casualty, but if TXU Gas elects to
repair or replace the damaged TXU Gas Merger Asset, TXU Gas shall promptly
commence and diligently proceed to complete the repair or replacement of the
damaged TXU Gas Merger Asset at its cost in a good and workmanlike manner (in
a manner consistent with the condition of the TXU Gas Merger Asset
immediately prior to the Casualty).   (c) If TXU Gas elects to repair or
replace such TXU Gas Merger Assets, but TXU Gas has not completed the repair
or replacement (and TXU Gas shall have used Reasonable Efforts to do so) at
the time when all other conditions to the respective obligations of the
Parties to consummate the transaction contemplated under this Agreement have
been or are reasonably expected to be met, the Parties may, subject to
Section 7.10(d), close the transactions contemplated hereby and, in such
event, TXU Gas will complete the repair or replacement after the Closing. LSG
will provide TXU Gas and its contractors access to the TXU Gas Merger Assets
as reasonably necessary to complete the repairs.   (d) If a Casualty
occurs, TXU Gas may extend the date for Closing for up to 90 days beyond the
Termination Date if it elects to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed
TXU Gas Merger Asset, is using Reasonable Efforts to effect such repair or
replacement, but is unable to complete such repair or replacement by the
Termination Date; provided that the period of such extension may not be
greater than reasonably required to effect such repair or replacement. If TXU
Gas elects not to repair or replace the damaged TXU Gas Merger Asset or fails
to repair or replace it within the time provided, LSG shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by written notice.   SECTION 7.11. Signs. Within
six (6) months after Closing, LSG shall remove all marks on signs and other

unfavorable injunction, judgment, order, decree or ruling filed or threatened
(as applicable) would prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or would cause such transactions to be

the right of LSG to own or operate the TXU Gas Merger Assets, or the
continued conduct the Business by LSG in all material respects as currently
conducted by TXU Gas;   (f) The Transfer Requirements identified in Schedule

contemplated by this Agreement, or would cause such transactions to be
rescinded following consummation, or would adversely affect the right of TXU
Gas to allocate the TXU Gas Merger Assets and the TXU Gas Merger Liabilities
to LSG under the terms of this Agreement.   ARTICLE IX  INDEMNIFICATION
AND ASSUMPTION   SECTION 9.01. By TXU Gas. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 9.01, TXU Gas shall indemnify and defend LSG, its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors,
agents and other representatives (each such Person being herein called a "TXU
Gas Indemnified Party", and all such Persons being collectively herein called
the "TXU Gas Indemnified Parties") against, and hold each TXU Gas Indemnified
Party harmless from, any loss, diminution in value, liability, damage, cost,
expense, action, award, suit, proceedings, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, Claim, demand, injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, taxes,
or liens (including reasonable costs of defense and investigations,
settlements, and fees, and further including court costs and reasonable
attorneys\' and witness fees) or penalties or fines (collectively, "Losses")
that such TXU Gas Indemnified Party incurs to the extent arising out of or
resulting from any of the following, and in each case whether known or
unknown (collectively, the "TXU Gas Indemnified Liabilities"):   (a) the
failure of any of the representations and warranties of TXU Gas contained in
this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date made (including the
Closing Date for those representations and warranties that are also made as
of the Closing Date);   (b) the failure of TXU Gas to perform any covenant
of TXU Gas in this Agreement; and   (c) the TXU Gas Retained
Liabilities.     31     SECTION 9.02. Environmental Indemnity.   (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 9.02, TXU Gas will
indemnify LSG for all Environmental Liabilities and Costs arising with
respect to any TXU Gas Merger Asset as a result of any action,
fact, circumstance or condition to the extent existing or occurring on or
before the Effective Time, but excluding all Environmental Liabilities and
Costs arising from the existence of non-friable asbestos and asbestos-
containing materials (to the extent the same do not violate Environmental
Laws) and any post-Closing activity that disturbs asbestos or asbestos-
containing materials. The foregoing are referred to as the "Environmental
Matters".   (b) The indemnity provided in this Section 9.02 only applies to
Qualifying Claims. A "Qualifying Claim" is a Claim for which LSG provides
a Claim Notice for indemnity before the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, and for which the aggregate of the Environmental Liabilities and Costs
exceed $1 million. TXU Gas has no indemnity obligations with respect to any
Environmental Matter if the aggregate of the Environmental Liabilities and
Costs is less than $1 million, and any costs associated therewith will not be
included in calculating any deductible under this Section 9.02.   (c) TXU
Gas has no indemnity obligation with respect to any Qualifying Claim until
the aggregate of the Environmental Liabilities and Costs with respect to all
Qualifying Claims exceeds $10 million, and then only with respect to sums in
excess of $10 million.   (d) TXU Gas will indemnify LSG for 50% of the
Environmental Liabilities and Costs incurred with respect to Qualifying
Claims in excess of $10 million, and 100% of the Environmental Liabilities
and Costs in excess of $20 million, subject to the limit on TXU Gas\'
indemnity obligation set forth in Section 9.03.   (e) TXU Gas\' indemnity
obligations with respect to any Environmental Liabilities or Costs will
terminate with respect to any Environmental Matter for which a Claim Notice
is not provided within the 3-year period, but the termination of the 3-year
period will not relieve TXU Gas\' indemnity obligations with respect to any
Qualifying Claim for which a Claims Notice for a bonafide Claim was given
before such date.   (f) The indemnity provided by this Section 9.02 shall
not affect the allocations of liabilities (and any related indemnities)
associated with the TXU Gas Excluded Assets or the TXU Gas Retained
Liabilities, and the payments of Losses in respect thereof shall not
constitute a credit against amounts otherwise payable by TXU Gas under this
Section 9.02.   (g) The indemnity provided by this Section 9.02 shall
not apply to the matters listed on Schedule 5.09.   SECTION 9.03.
Limitations. (a) TXU Gas shall not be liable under Section 9.01(a) unless the
aggregate amount of Losses with respect to such matters exceeds $15 million,
and then only with respect to the Losses over that amount, and TXU Gas\'
maximum liability under Section 9.01(a) and Section 9.02 will never exceed
10% of the LSG Merger Assets. The     32    limitations in this
Section 9.03(a) will not, however, apply to breaches of the representations
in Sections 5.01, 5.02, or 5.03(a)(i)(A), and will not limit damages for
fraud.   (b) LSG shall not be liable under Section 9.04(a) unless
the aggregate amount of Losses with respect to such matter exceeds $15
million, and then only with respect to the Losses over that amount, and
LSG\'s maximum liability under Section 9.04(a) will never exceed 10% of the
LSG Merger Assets. The limitations in this Section 9.03(b) will not, however,
apply to breaches of the representations in Sections 6.01, 6.02, or
6.04(a)(i)(A), and will not limit damages for fraud.   (c) A limitation on
indemnification provided in this Section 9.03 as to any matter will not apply
to reduce the amount of indemnity otherwise applicable to such matter. For
the purposes of this Article IX, once a determination has been made that a
specific breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has
occurred for purposes of the indemnification obligation hereunder, the
calculation of Losses with respect to such specific breach shall be made
without regard to any limitation or qualification as to materiality or
Material Adverse Affect set forth in such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement.   SECTION 9.04. By LSG. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Section 9.04, LSG shall indemnify and defend TXU Gas and its Affiliates,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors,
agents and other representatives (each such Person being herein called a "LSG
Indemnified Party", and all such Persons being collectively herein called the
"LSG Indemnified Parties") against, and hold each LSG Indemnified Party
harmless from, any Losses that such LSG Indemnified Party incurs to the
extent arising out of or resulting from any of the following, and in each
case whether known or unknown (collectively, the "LSG Indemnified
Liabilities"):   (a) the failure of any of the representations and
warranties of LSG contained in this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the date made (including the Closing Date for those representations and
warranties that are also made as of the Closing Date);   (b) the failure of
LSG to perform any covenant of LSG in this Agreement; and   (c) the TXU Gas
Merger Liabilities.   SECTION 9.05. Express Negligence Rule. WITHOUT
LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR CLAIM GIVING RISE TO THE INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PARAGRAPH CONSTITUTES A CONSPICUOUS LEGEND.  
SECTION 9.06. Notice of Claim. (a) For purposes of this Article IX, the term
"Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with a particular Claim
means the Party having     33    an obligation to indemnify another
party with respect to such Claim pursuant to this Article IX, and the term
"Indemnified Party" when used in connection with a particular Claim means the
party having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Claim by
another Party pursuant to this Article IX.   (b) Promptly after any
Indemnified Party becomes aware of facts giving rise to a Claim by it for
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, such Indemnified Party will
provide notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party (a "Claim
Notice") specifying the nature and specific basis for such Claim and a copy
of all papers served with respect to such Claim (if any). For purposes of
this Section 9.06(b), receipt by a Party of written notice of any demand,
assertion, claim, action or proceeding (judicial, administrative or
otherwise) by or from any Person other than a Party to this Agreement
which gives rise to a Claim on behalf of such Party constitutes the discovery
of facts giving rise to a Claim by it and the Party must give prompt notice
of the receipt of such matter as provided in the first sentence of this
Section 9.06(b); provided that, the failure to give notice in a timely manner
as required will not negate or otherwise affect the indemnification
obligation of the Indemnifying Party except: (i) to the extent, if any, the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give such timely
notice, and (ii) as provided in Section 9.09. Each Claim Notice must set
forth a reasonable description of the Claim and must contain a statement to
the effect that the Indemnified Party giving the notice is making a claim and
formal demand for indemnification under this Article IX.   SECTION 9.07.
Third Party Claims. (a) If any third Person notifies an Indemnified Party
with respect to any matter that gives rise to a claim for indemnification
against the Indemnifying Party under this Article IX, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice
relating to such Third Party Claim. The failure to give notice in a timely
manner as required by the preceding sentence will not negate or
otherwise affect the indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party
except: (i) to the extent, if any, the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by the failure to give such timely notice, and (ii) as provided in
Section 9.09. Prior to the expiration of the 45-day period following the
Indemnifying Party\'s receipt of such notice (the "Election Period"), the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party: (i) whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party
under this Article IX, with respect to such Third Party Claim; and (ii)
whether the Indemnifying Party elects, at the sole cost and expense of such
Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim.   (b) If an Indemnifying Party notifies an Indemnified Party within
the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party does not dispute
its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX and
that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its sole
cost and expense, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, and
the Indemnifying Party must prosecute the proceedings to a final conclusion
or settle the proceedings at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 9.07(b). The Indemnifying Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that, without the consent of the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party may not admit or stipulate the liability of any
Indemnified Party or bind a party to an injunction or     34    any
material future obligation or restriction. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense in
contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party has the right to participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.07(b) and shall bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to any such participation.   (c) Unless and
until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 9.07 above, the Indemnified Party may defend itself
against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate. In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld), unless the Indemnified
Party waives indemnification with respect to the Third Party Claim so settled
and adjudicated.   SECTION 9.08. Subrogation. If any Indemnified Party has
a right against a third party (other than an insurance provider of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses paid to such
Indemnified Party by an Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnifying Party
shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to the right of such
Indemnified Party.   SECTION 9.09. Exclusive Remedies; Survival of
Representations and Warranties; Limitation of Certain Liabilities.   (a)
The Parties: (i) agree that only actual damages shall be recoverable under
this Agreement and (ii) hereby waive any right to recover special, punitive,
consequential, incidental or exemplary damages, except to the extent any such
Party suffers such damages to an unaffiliated third party in connection with
a Third Party Claim, in which event such damages shall be recoverable;
provided that the foregoing shall not limit a Party\'s ability to recover
damages for diminution in value as an element of actual damages,
whether involving a direct claim against such Party or by an unaffiliated
third party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(other than Section 7.03(b)), the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies for any Claim based upon this
Agreement or the transactions described herein following Closing except for
fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, and subject to such exceptions, all
other remedies available at law or in equity, in tort, contract or otherwise
are hereby waived, released and discharged by each Party.   (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Party has
any indemnification obligation under this Agreement arising from the failure
of a representation or warranty made by such Party unless the Claim Notice
relevant thereto is delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the end of
any survival period with respect to such representation and warranty as set
forth in Section 9.09(c).   (c) Except as provided below, each Party\'s
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and any
certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith shall survive the
Closing and any investigation by the Parties and, except for the
representations and     35    warranties pursuant to Sections 5.01,
5.02, 5.03(a)(i)(A), 6.01, 6.02 and 6.04(a)(i)(A), terminate on the date
which is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date. After termination, a
Party may not bring any action or present any Claim for a breach of any such
representation or warranty. However, a Party\'s rights to indemnity will not
expire with respect to a bona fide Claim properly asserted in writing before
the date which is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date. The
representations and warranties pursuant to Sections 5.01, 5.02,
5.03(a)(i)(A), 6.01, 6.02 and 6.04(a)(i) and the covenants and obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement survive the Closing without limitation.  
ARTICLE X  TERMINATION   SECTION 10.01. Termination Events. This Agreement
may be terminated by written notice given prior to or at the Closing, such
termination to be effective as of the time and date of the other Party\'s
receipt thereof:   (a) by any Party 30 days after giving written notice to
the other Parties of a material breach of any provision of this Agreement, if
the breach has not been cured or waived;   (b) by mutual consent of the
Parties;   (c) by LSG pursuant to Section 7.10; or   (d) by any Party if
the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2004, subject to
Section 7.10.   SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. The following
provisions apply if this Agreement is terminated:   (a) If the conditions
to the Closing set forth in Section 8.02 have been satisfied or waived and
TXU Gas fails to close for any reason except pursuant to an express right as
set forth herein, LSG will be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity as a result of such wrongful termination;
subject, however, to any applicable provisions of Section 9.08.   (b) If
the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.01, other than the
receipt of the approvals listed in Schedule 6.04(b), have been satisfied or
waived, and LSG fails to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement before December 31, 2004 for any reason except pursuant to
an express right as set forth herein, LSG shall pay TXU Gas $15 million.
The failure of LSG to close because of the failure to receive the approvals
on Schedule 6.04(b) will not relieve LSG\'s payment obligations under this
Section. Such payment will be promptly paid by wire-transfer of immediately
available funds immediately upon demand by TXU Gas and without any right of
setoff. Upon payment by LSG (or LSG\'s designee) of such amount, LSG will be
fully released and discharged from any liability or obligation resulting for
its failure to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    
36     (c) The Parties agree that the provisions of this Section 10.02
will survive any termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 11.01. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including
all exhibits and schedules hereto, supersedes any and all other agreements,
oral or written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 11.02. No Reliance on
External Representations. LSG acknowledges that, in determining whether to
consummate the transactions described in this Agreement, it has not relied on
any representation, warranty or other statement of TXU Gas, or any officer,
director, employee, representative or agent of TXU Gas, other than those
representations, warranties and statements set forth in this Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto), and the certificates and other
instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement. TXU Gas shall have no
liability to LSG or any other Person, resulting from the distribution to LSG,
or LSG\'s use of, any such information relating to TXU Gas, or prepared by or
on behalf of TXU Gas, and supplied to LSG before the date hereof, or any
information, documents or materials made available to LSG in any data rooms,
any presentation or in any other form relating to the business of TXU Gas in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the
representations, warranties and statements set forth herein or in
such certificates or other instruments.   SECTION 11.03. Amendments. This
Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by LSG and TXU Gas.  
SECTION 11.04. Waivers. The delay or failure of a Party to exercise any right

or obligation, or any similar right or obligation. Waivers are only effective
if in writing.   SECTION 11.05. Parties in Interest. This Agreement is
binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and may not
be assigned by any Party, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no Person
other than the Parties to this Agreement have any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement, or any provision of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of LSG Parent from and after the date
LSG merges into LSG Parent.   SECTION 11.06. Notices. All notices, consents,

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to provide each other with the same level of
access to such properties, facilities, software application (to the
extent contractually authorized under the underlying software agreements) and
other items (the "Access") after the Execution Date.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing, the Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I 
ACCESS   1.1 The Access. The TXU Companies shall provide or cause to be
provided to Atmos Energy the Access to the same extent as was being provided
by the TXU Companies to TXU Gas prior to the Execution Date. Atmos Energy
shall provide or cause to be provided to the TXU Companies the Access to the
same extent as was being provided by TXU Gas to the TXU Companies prior to
the Execution Date. The Party providing or causing to be provided the Access
hereunder shall be referred to herein as the "Access Provider" and the Party
receiving such Access shall be referred to herein as the "Access
Recipient."   1.2 Impracticability. The Access Provider shall not be
required to provide any Access to the extent it (a) becomes impracticable, in
any material respect, as a result of a cause or causes outside the reasonable
control of the Access Provider, (b) would require the Access Provider to
violate any applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or (c) would result in
the breach of any agreement or other applicable contract existing on the
Execution Date.   1.3 Information to be Furnished to Access Provider. The
Access Recipient agrees to provide the Access Provider in a timely manner
with information necessary for, or reasonably requested by, the Access
Provider to provide the Access required to be provided by the Access Provider
hereunder.   1.4 Additional Resources. In providing the Access, the Access
Provider shall not be obligated to (a) hire any additional employees, (b)
maintain the employment of any specific employee, or (c) purchase, lease or

written notice to the other Party. Provided, however, Access provided to
Atmos Energy by the TXU Companies to any particular property, facility,
software application or other item that is related to a service covered by a
Transitional Services Agreement issued in connection with the transaction
between Atmos Energy and TXU Gas shall cease at the same time the associated
service is terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this
Agreement or the Access to any facility, property, software application or
other item covered hereunder may be terminated by the mutual written consent
of the Parties at any time.   ARTICLE III  GENERAL OBLIGATIONS; STANDARD OF
CARE   3.1 Indemnification by the Access Recipient. With respect to the
Access provided under this Agreement, the Access Recipient shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Access Provider, as applicable, its officers,
employees, agents, and consultants from and against any and all liabilities
that arise out of, or result from, the provision of Access by the Access
Provider, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement, other than
liabilities arising solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Access Provider, as applicable, or its agents or employees. Additionally,
each Party will maintain policies of insurance with coverages, limits and
deductibles that are reasonable and customary within the industry.   3.2
Good Faith Cooperation. The Parties will use good faith efforts to cooperate
with each other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the
Access.   3.3 Confidentiality. It is understood that from time to time in
the performance of this Agreement, that the Parties may receive, or have
access to, confidential or proprietary information of the other Party. As
such, each Party agrees to keep any such information confidential and not to
disclose such confidential information to third parties. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, each Party will have the right to make such disclosures, if any, to
governmental agencies, courts of law and to its affiliates, attorneys,
auditors and accountants, as may be reasonably necessary. In the event a
Party is required to provide such confidential information in a proceeding
before a governmental agency or court of law, then such Party will
immediately notify the other Party, who may seek a protective order or
confidentiality agreement, whichever is applicable, and the Party in
possession of such confidential information will fully cooperate with the
other Party in such efforts. In the event a Party discloses such confidential
information to its affiliates, attorneys, auditors or accountants, then such
Party will nevertheless continue to have the obligation to protect such
confidential information of the other Party, and will remain liable for any
failure to do so.     2     ARTICLE IV  FORCE MAJEURE   The Access
Provider will be excused for any failure or delay in performing any of its

Majeure. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Force Majeure" means any

(iii) any and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) reasonably
incurred by TXU Gas or TXU Corp., a Texas corporation ("TXU Parent") in
enforcing TXU Gas\' rights under this Guaranty.   2. This instrument shall
be an absolute, continuing, irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of full
and prompt payment and performance and not a guaranty of collection, and the
Guarantor shall remain liable on its indebtedness, liabilities and
obligations hereunder until the payment and performance in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations. No set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, reduction or
diminution of any indebtedness, liability or obligation, or any defense of
any kind or nature which LSG or its Affiliates may have against TXU Gas, TXU
Parent or any    other party, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be available to, or asserted by, the Guarantor against TXU Gas.   3.
The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be unconditional
irrespective of:   (a) any lack of enforceability of any Guaranteed
Obligations or consummation of the transactions contemplated under the
Agreement, including any defense based upon or arising by reason of any lack
of authority of any officer, director or any other person acting or

party at any time liable for the payment of any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations;   (g) any renewal, extension, modification, waiver, amendment
or rearrangement of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
instrument, document or agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise relating
to any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;   (h) any adjustment,
indulgence, forbearance, waiver or compromise that may be granted or given by
TXU Gas, the Guarantor or any other party ever liable for any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;   (i) any neglect, delay, omission, failure or
refusal of TXU Gas to enforce such performance by LSG or to take or prosecute
any action for the collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or to
foreclose or take or prosecute any action in connection with any instrument,
document, or agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise relating to any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations;   (j) any payment by LSG to TXU Gas is
held to constitute a preference or fraudulent transfer or conveyance under
any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law or if for any other reason LSG is
required to refund any payment or pay the amount thereof to someone
else;    Page 2    (k) the settlement or compromise of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations;   (l) the non-perfection of any security interest
or lien securing any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;   (m) any change
in the corporate or other entity existence, structure or ownership of LSG;
or   (n) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense
available to, or discharge of, LSG or the Guarantor (other than a defense of
payment or performance or a defense expressly provided in
the Agreement).  This guarantee shall be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment or performance of the obligations
under this Guaranty is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by TXU Gas
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of LSG or Guarantor or
otherwise.  Upon indefeasible payment or performance in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations owing to TXU Gas, Guarantor shall be subrogated to the
rights of TXU Gas against LSG, and TXU Gas agrees to take such steps as
Guarantor may reasonably request to implement such subrogation. However,
Guarantor may not exercise any right of subrogation until the Guaranteed
Obligations are paid in full.   4. No failure or delay on the part of TXU
Gas to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by TXU Gas of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any
other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and
every right, remedy and power hereby granted to TXU Gas or allowed it by law
or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and
may be exercised by TXU Gas from time to time and at any time.   5. All

valid and binding obligations of Guarantor, enforceable against it in
accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be

equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
law or equity);   (e) except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, none of
the execution and delivery of this Guaranty or the Agreement by LSG, or

departure by the Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by TXU Gas.   8. This Guaranty is
for the benefit of TXU Gas and its successors and assigns, and in the event
of an assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, and the
rights and benefits hereunder, may be transferred by TXU Gas. This Guaranty
is binding not only on the Guarantor, but on the Guarantor\'s successors and
assigns. The Guarantor may not assign its rights, interest or obligations
hereunder to any other person without the prior written consent of TXU Gas,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of TXU Gas, and
any purported assignment absent such consent is void.   9. The Guarantor
recognizes that TXU Gas is relying upon this Guaranty and the undertakings of
the Guarantor hereunder in agreeing to the terms of the Merger and further
recognizes that the execution and delivery of this Guaranty is a material
inducement to TXU Gas in entering into the Agreement. The Guarantor hereby
acknowledges that there are no conditions to the full effectiveness of this
Guaranty.   10. The Guarantor shall pay on demand all reasonable attorneys\'
fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by TXU Gas or TXU

under the Guaranteed Obligations, demand of payment, notice of acceptance of
this Guaranty, presentment, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
the incurring by LSG of additional obligations and all other notices and
demands with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty.   12.
The Guarantor agrees that TXU Gas may exercise, or fail or refuse to
exercise, any and all rights and remedies granted to any of them under
the Agreement without affecting the validity or enforceability of this
Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby waives the right to require TXU Gas to proceed
against LSG on the Guaranteed Obligations.   13. THIS GUARANTY EMBODIES THE
FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF THE GUARANTOR AND TXU GAS WITH RESPECT TO THE
GUARANTOR\'S GUARANTY OF THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS AND SUPERCEDES ANY AND
ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING, WHETHER

shall be limited to a    period of ten (10) years from the date hereof
with respect to Guaranteed Obligations relating to TXU Gas Retained
Liabilities. No notice, demand or claim hereunder may be made after the
expiration of such period. Notices, demands or claims made hereunder prior to
such expiration shall not release Guarantor from liability for such
Guaranteed Obligations for which a notice, demand or claim has been made
prior to expiration.   3. This instrument shall be an absolute, continuing,
irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of full and prompt payment and not a
guaranty of collection, and the Guarantor shall remain liable on its
indebtedness, liabilities and obligations hereunder until the payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations. No set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
reduction or diminution of any indebtedness, liability or obligation, or any
defense of any kind or nature which TXU Gas may have against LSG, LSP Parent
or any other party, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
available to, or asserted by, the Guarantor against LSG.   4. The liability
of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be unconditional irrespective
of:   (a) any lack of enforceability of any Guaranteed
Obligations, including any defense based upon or arising by reason of any
lack of authority or any officer, director or any other person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of TXU Gas;   (b) any change of the time,
manner or place of payment, or any other term, of any Obligations;   (c)
any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction affecting any term of any
Obligations or LSG\'s rights with respect thereto;   (d) the insolvency,
receivership, reorganization or bankruptcy of TXU Gas;   (e) the merger or
consolidation of TXU Gas with or into another entity (including, without
limitation, the Guarantor), the loss of TXU Gas\' separate legal identity or
the cessation of TXU Gas\' existence;   (f) any disability of TXU Gas, or
the dissolution, insolvency or bankruptcy of TXU Gas, the Guarantor or any
other party at any time liable for the payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;   (g) any renewal, extension, modification, waiver,
amendment or rearrangement of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or any
instrument, document or agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise relating
to any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;    Page 2    (h) any
adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, waiver or compromise that may be granted
or given by LSG, the Guarantor or any other party ever liable for any or all
of the Guaranteed Obligations;   (i) any neglect, delay, omission, failure
or refusal of LSG to take or prosecute any action for the collection of any
of the Guaranteed Obligations or to foreclose or take or prosecute any action
in connection with any instrument, document, or agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise relating to any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations;   (j) any payment by TXU Gas to LSG is held to constitute
a preference or fraudulent transfer or conveyance under any applicable
bankruptcy or insolvency law or if for any other reason TXU Gas is required
to refund any payment or pay the amount thereof to someone else;   (k) the
settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;   (l) the
non-perfection of any security interest or lien securing any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;   (m) any change in the corporate or other entity
existence, structure or ownership of TXU Gas; or   (n) any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
discharge of, TXU Gas or the Guarantor (other than a defense of payment or a
defense expressly provided in the Agreement).  This guarantee shall be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment or
performance of the obligations under this Guaranty is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by LSG upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of TXU Gas or Guarantor or otherwise.  Upon indefeasible
payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations owing to LSG, Guarantor shall
be subrogated to the rights of LSG against TXU Gas, and LSG agrees to take
such steps as Guarantor may reasonably request to implement such subrogation.
However, Guarantor may not exercise any right of subrogation until the
Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full.   5. No failure or delay on the
part of LSG to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or
power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise by LSG of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any
other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and
every right, remedy and power hereby granted to    Page 3   LSG or
allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any other, and may be exercised by LSG from time to time.   6. All notices
