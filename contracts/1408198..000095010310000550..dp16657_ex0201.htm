ARTICLE 2

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation").

 

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. EDT in New York City at the offices
of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017
as soon as possible, but in any event no later than five Business Days after
the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree in writing.

 

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified
in the certificate of merger).

 

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

 

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

 

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), 2.02(d), 2.05 or 2.07,
each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.1802 shares of Parent
Stock (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock as
specified below, the "Per Share Stock Consideration") and (ii) an amount in
cash equal to $16.35, without interest (the "Per Share Cash Consideration").
The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration are
referred to collectively herein as the "Merger Consideration". As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and the right to receive any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in each case to
be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

 

 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
preferences as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for
any such shares resulting from the conversion of shares pursuant to Section
2.02(d)).

 

 

(d) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or the Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage
of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares").
Subject to Section 2.03(f), Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, as needed, for the benefit of the holders of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, for exchange in accordance with
this Article 2, (A) certificates representing the shares of Parent Stock that
constitute the stock portion of the Merger Consideration and (B) an amount of
cash necessary to satisfy the cash portion of the Merger Consideration.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than five Business Days
after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Stock as of the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and
reviewed by the Company prior to delivery thereof) and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
receipt of an "agent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parent's option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and the right to
receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(f). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Upon
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 2, each Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately
be cancelled.

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and 2.03(f) that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.03(f), in respect
of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any amounts

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be paid to the holder
of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this
Section 2.03. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have
been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.07 and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior to
surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or
transfer payable with respect to such securities. Parent shall deposit or
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Exchange Agent (A) the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.07 as promptly as practicable after the determination
of such amount pursuant to Section 2.07 and (B) the amount of any dividend or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and with a
payment date on or prior to the date of surrender or transfer no later than
the applicable payment date, which amounts shall be held for the sole benefit
of the holders of the shares of Company Stock and for the sole purpose of
making the payments contemplated by clause (i) of this Section 2.03(f).

 

 

(g) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03 in respect of any Dissenting Shares
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

 

(h) The payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred by a holder of Company Stock in connection
with the Merger with respect to such Company Stock, and the filing of any
related Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and
fees, shall be the sole responsibility of such holder. Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange
Agent in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration.

 

 

Section 2.04. Stock Options and Restricted Shares. (a) The terms of each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock under any employee

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a "Company
Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be adjusted as
necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
constitute an option (each, an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
Option, shares of Parent Stock in an amount and at an exercise price, each as
determined in the following sentence. Each Adjusted Option shall represent
the right to acquire (i) a number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by (B) the Option
Exchange Ratio (ii) at an exercise price per share of Parent Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Company Stock purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option
divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; provided that (1) in all cases, the
exercise price of, and number of shares subject to, each Adjusted Option
shall be determined as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and
(2) for any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the
Code, the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code.

 

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted share
("Company Restricted Share"), which represents shares of Company Stock,
subject to vesting and forfeiture will be adjusted so that its holder will be
entitled to receive a number of restricted shares of Parent Stock (i) equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Share, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) then down, as
applicable, to the nearest whole shares (with 0.50 being rounded
upward), subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions as the Company
Restricted Share.

 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions, if any,
as are reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Section 2.04.

 

 

(d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Option and Company Restricted Share pursuant to this Section
2.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.
Within two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Company
Stock Option and Company Restricted Share and, where applicable, shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared
effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and to maintain
the effectiveness of such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration statement covering such Company Stock Option and Company
Restricted Share (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock Option and Company
Restricted Share remains outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if
any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to administer the Company Option Plan
assumed pursuant to this Section 2.04 in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent the Company Option Plan
complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

 

 

Section 2.05. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section
2.02(b)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware
Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares"
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall only have such rights as are provided by Section 262 of
Delaware Law; provided that if such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
loses such holder's right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware
Law or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder
is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such
shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.02(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide
Parent (a) prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relate to such demand, and (b)
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands and the exercise of appraisal rights
under the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, or to the extent required by Applicable Law, the
Company shall not take any action with respect to such demands (including
making any payment with respect to, or offering to settle or settling or
approving any withdrawal of, any such demands.

 

 

Section 2.06. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock or
shares of Parent Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or
a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or stock dividend

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereon with a record date during such period), the Merger Consideration and,
if applicable, the Per Share Stock Consideration and its determination shall
be appropriately adjusted.

 

 

Section 2.07. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder
of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result
of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying (i) the average of
the closing prices for a share of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
for the 20 trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding
the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 

 

Section 2.08. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 

Section 2.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably require, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate and any
dividends or other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as
contemplated by this Article 2.

the indemnification obligations provided for in Section 7.05(b).

 

 

Section 3.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.02. Corporate Authorization. (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by
the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Company's
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the Company's
capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(the "Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company's Board of Directors has
(i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) unanimously
resolved, subject to Section 6.03(b), to recommend approval and adoption
of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company
Board Recommendation").

 

 

Section 4.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the

Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,

1934 Act, and any other applicable state or federal securities, takeover and
"blue sky" laws, (v) compliance with any applicable requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange and (vi) any actions or filings the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Company Disclosure Schedule and as contemplated in Section 8.05, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19

with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable
Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03,
require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise,
permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or
relating in any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

 

Section 4.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Stock, $0.01 par value,
and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of

schedule and number of shares of Company Stock subject thereto has been made
available to Parent.

 

 

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in this Section
4.05 and for changes since February 25, 2010 resulting from the exercise of
Company Stock Options outstanding on such date and the vesting of Company
Restricted Shares outstanding on such date, there are no issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (ii) securities

economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of,
any capital stock of or voting securities of the Company (the items in
clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to collectively as
the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Securities. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of
any Company Securities.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05, none of (i) the shares of

Subsidiary of the Company.

organized, is validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers
and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for
those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence
of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in
Section 4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.06(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company 10-K identifies, as of its filing date, all
material Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of
organization.

 

 

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the

of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value
or price of, any capital stock or other voting securities of, or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses
(i) through (iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary
Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the
Company Subsidiary Securities. Except as set forth in Section 4.06(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and except for the capital stock or other voting
securities of, or ownership interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other voting securities
of, or ownership interests in, any Person.

 

 

Section 4.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) The Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC, all reports, schedules, forms,

the "Company SEC Documents").

 

 

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each Company
SEC Document complied, and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be.

 

 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

 

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 

 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act are being
prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in the Company's periodic and current reports required under the
1934 Act.

 

 

(f) Since January 30, 2008, the Company and its Subsidiaries have established
and maintained a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and
the preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, to the Company's
auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in internal controls.

 

 

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the Company. The Company has
not, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(h) Since January 30, 2008, the Company has complied in all material respects
with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
the New York Stock Exchange.

 

 

(i) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct.

 

 

Section 4.08. Financial Statements. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the
Company included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents
fairly present in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-
end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

 

 

Section 4.09. Disclosure Documents. The information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the registration statement

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto pursuant to which shares
of Parent Stock issuable as part of the Merger Consideration will be
registered with the SEC (the "Registration Statement") shall not at the time
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (or, with respect
to any post-effective amendment or supplement, at the time such post-
effective amendment or supplement becomes effective) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the proxy statement
of the Company to be filed as part of the Registration Statement with the SEC
and to be sent to the Company stockholders in connection with the Merger (the
"Proxy Statement"), or any amendment or supplement thereto, shall not, on
the date the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Approval contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties
contained in this Section 4.09 will not apply to statements or omissions
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto based
upon information supplied by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
respective representatives or advisors specifically for use or incorporation
by reference therein.

 

 

Section 4.10. Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth in
Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since the Company Balance
Sheet Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practices and there has

of any Company Securities or any Company Subsidiary Securities (other than in
connection with the forfeiture or exercise of equity based awards, options
and restricted stock in the Company or any Subsidiary in either case, in
accordance with existing agreements or terms);

 

 

(c) any amendment of any material term of any Company Security or any Company
Subsidiary Security (in each case, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise);

Section 4.13. Investment Advisers Act. (a) Institutional Shareholder Services
Inc. ("U.S. Subsidiary") is properly registered as an "investment adviser"
pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, and such registration is, and has
been from the time such registration was required, effective and in good
standing. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, in all material
respects, in compliance with its obligations under the Investment Advisers
Act. There are no prior, pending, expected or otherwise known violations of,
or other actions or omissions constituting a lack of compliance with, the
Investment Advisers Act committed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Person "associated" (as such term is used in Section 202(a)(17) of the
Investment Advisers Act) with (or supervised by) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably
likely to have an adverse effect in any material respect on the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, other than U.S. Subsidiary and RiskMetrics
(Australia) Pty Ltd. ("Australian Subsidiary"), is an "investment adviser"
required to register as such under the Investment Advisers Act or any other
Applicable Law and is subject to any material liability or disability by

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries provides any services that may be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed "investment advice" pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act to any
investment vehicle, company, fund, account or other Person. Each Investment
Advisory Agreement complies with the Investment Advisers Act and all other
Applicable Law, except where failure to comply, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

 

 

(c) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Company's
knowledge, any other Person that is "associated" (as such term is used in
Section 202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers Act) with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (i) is subject to disqualification pursuant to Sections
203(e) or 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act from serving as an investment
adviser or as an associated person to an investment adviser, (ii) is subject
to disqualification pursuant to Rule 206(4)-3 under the Investment Advisers
Act from serving as a solicitor for an investment adviser, (iii) is the
subject of a rebuttable presumption pursuant to Rule 206(4)-4(b) under the
Investment Advisers Act or (iv) has, in the past 10 years been subject to a
material fine or censure by a Governmental Authority on account of
allegations of misconduct relating to the financial services or investment
banking industries or of fraud. There is no proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that would reasonably
be expected to become the basis for any such disqualification, fine or
censure.

(i) registered as a commodity pool operator, a broker-dealer, a commodity
trading advisor (or in a similar capacity) with any Governmental Authority,

director, officer and employee (in his or her capacity as such) of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries who is required to be registered as an
investment adviser, an investment adviser representative, a broker-dealer or
a registered representative (or in a similar capacity) with any Governmental
Authority is duly registered as such and such registration is in full force
and effect.

 

 

(e) The Company has made available or delivered to Parent a copy of the Form
ADV Part I, as amended to date, as filed with the SEC, and the Form ADV Part
II, as amended to date, of U.S. Subsidiary. As of the date of its filing or
amendment (or, in the case of a Form ADV Part II, each date on which it was
distributed), each Form ADV Part I and each Form ADV Part II was accurate and
correct in all material respects and complied with Applicable Law in all
material respects. No disclosure statement containing information
comparable to a Form ADV is required to be filed under Applicable Law with
any Governmental Authority with respect to Australian Subsidiary.

 

 

(f) Copies of all material inspection reports or other similar documents
furnished to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental
Entity and any material responses thereto (in each case, since January 1,
2008) have been made available to Parent.

Advisers Act and (iii) all such other policies and procedures required by
Rule 206(4)-7 under the Investment Advisers Act, and has designated and
approved an appropriate chief compliance officer in accordance with Rule
206(4)-7. All such policies and procedures (including codes of ethics) comply
in all material respects with Applicable Law, including Sections 204A and 206
of the Investment Advisers Act and there have been no material violations or
allegations of material violations of such policies or procedures (including

capacity as directors, trustees, officers, agents, representatives or
employees) have (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses, or (ii) made any payment for an
unlawful reciprocal practice, or made any other unlawful payment or given

knowledge of the Company, any present or former officer, director or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person, in each case,
for whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable or any of their
respective properties before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits,

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are the sole owners of all Owned
Intellectual Property Rights and hold all right, title and interest in and to
all Owned Intellectual Property Rights, free and clear of any Liens other
than Permitted Liens. The Licensed Intellectual Property Rights and the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights together constitute all the Intellectual
Property Rights necessary to, or used or held for use in, the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. There
exist no restrictions on the disclosure, use, license or transfer of the
Owned Intellectual Property Rights. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, encumber, impair or extinguish
any Owned Intellectual Property Rights or, to the knowledge of the Company,
Licensed Intellectual Property Rights. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any current or contingent exclusive license or other
exclusive right to any Intellectual Property Right to any other Person.

 

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken actions commensurate with

applicable Governmental Authority.

 

 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property Right of any third person. There is no claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any Intellectual Property Rights or any of the

The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps in accordance
with normal industry practice to maintain the confidentiality of all Owned
Intellectual Property Rights and Licensed Intellectual Property Rights that
are material to the business or operation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the value of which to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof and no such
Intellectual Property Rights have been disclosed other than to employees,
representatives and agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries all of
whom are bound by confidentiality obligations. Each employee, consultant and
contractor engaged in research or product or software development for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has executed a written agreement assigning
or is otherwise required to assign to the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary all right title and interest in and to any works of authorship or

Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any
other Person any current or contingent right to any source code included in
the Owned Intellectual Property Rights. None of the software that is owned
or distributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contains any
software code that is licensed by the Company as licensor under any terms or
conditions that require that any software be (i) made available or
distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making
derivative works; (iii) licensed under terms that allow reverse engineering,
reverse assembly or disassembly of any kind; or (iv) redistributable at no
charge.

 

 

(f) It is the practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries to scan with
commercially available virus scan software all software used in the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are capable of being scanned for
viruses. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the software included in
the Owned Intellectual Property Rights or that is distributed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or that is used or held for use in the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
contains any computer code designed to disrupt, disable or harm in any manner
the operation of any software or hardware. To the knowledge of the Company,
none of the software included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights or
the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights and that is used in the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted contains any worm,
bomb, backdoor, clock, timer, or other disabling device code, design or
routine which can cause software to be erased, inoperable, or otherwise
incapable of being used, either automatically or upon command by any person.

 

 

(g) The IT Assets operate and perform in a manner that permits the Company
and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently
conducted and to the knowledge of the Company, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to the IT Assets. The Company and its Subsidiaries have

Applicable Law (including any extensions), and all such material Tax Returns
are true and complete in all material respects. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has paid or has withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Taxing Authority all material Taxes that have become due and payable.

Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their respective books.

 

 

(b) (i) The income and franchise Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries through the Tax year ended December 31, 2004 have been examined
and closed or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for
assessment under Applicable Law, after giving effect to extensions or
waivers, has expired; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted an extension or waiver of the limitation period for
the assessment or collection of any Tax that remains in effect; and (iii)

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns an interest in real
property in any jurisdiction in which a Tax is imposed, or the value of the
interest is reassessed, on the transfer of an interest in real property and
which treats the transfer of an interest in an entity that owns an interest
in real property as a transfer of the interest in real property.

 

 

(h) None of the Subsidiaries of the Company owns any Company Stock.

 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the representations and warranties made in this
Section 4.17 and Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.18 with respect to

imposition of any such tax (domestic or foreign) (a "Taxing Authority"), and
any liability for any of the foregoing as transferee, (ii) liability for the
payment of any Tax of the type described in clause (i) as a result of being

other Person, and (iii) liability for the payment of any amount as a result

funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto have
been made available to Parent together with the most recent annual report
(Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form
990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust. Such plans are
referred to collectively herein as the "Employee Plans." Each Employee Plan
for the benefit of employees outside the United States or maintained outside

why any such determination letter would be likely to be revoked or not be
reissued. The Company has made available to Parent copies of the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such
Employee Plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
each Employee Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including ERISA, the Code and any applicable foreign laws, which
are applicable to such Employee Plan. No material events have occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or
against the Company of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975,
4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

liability in respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance
benefits for retired, former or current employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of
the Code.

 

 

(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2009.

 

 

(h) All contributions due under each Employee Plan have been paid when due or
properly accrued on the Company's financial statements.

 

 

(i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending
against or involving or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against

of the date of this Agreement, and excerpts of those portions of each fee
letter and engagement letter associated therewith that contain any conditions
to funding or "flex" provisions or other provisions (excluding provisions
related solely to fees and economic terms (other than covenants) agreed to by
the parties) regarding the terms and conditions of the financing to be
provided thereby (such commitment letter, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and each such fee letter and
engagement letter, collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to
which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc. has agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision

amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this
Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the
date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, Morgan
Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Other than as expressly set

contingencies related to the funding of the full net

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds of the Financing (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in
connection therewith) and (ii) no agreements, side letters, arrangements or
understandings that would, or would reasonably be expected to, (A) impair the
validity of the Commitment Letter, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing, (C) delay or prevent the Closing or (D) modify the terms of the
Financing in any manner adverse to Parent or the Company. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, and assuming the accuracy in
all material respects of the Company's representations and warranties
contained in Article 4 and assuming compliance by the Company in all
material respects with its covenants contained in Section 6.01 and 8.02, the
net proceeds of the Financing, together with other financial resources of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary including cash on hand and marketable securities
of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries on the Closing Date,
will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent's
and Merger Subsidiary's obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article 2, and the
payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled,
terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection with the Merger (including,
without limitation, the Company Credit Facility) and of all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with consummating the Merger
and the Financing (collectively, the "Required Amounts"). As of the date of
this Agreement, (a) no event has occurred that would constitute a breach or
default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Parent, Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc., under the Commitment Letter and (b) subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 and the
Company's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds
necessary for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Subsidiary's
obligations under this Agreement and the payment of any Required Amounts will
not be available to Parent on the Closing Date (provided that neither Parent
nor Merger Subsidiary makes any representation regarding the satisfaction of
conditions to the extent relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries).

the Commitment Letter to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement.

pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Parent SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

 

 

(d) Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 

 

(e) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to Parent's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Parent's periodic and current reports required
under the 1934 Act.

 

 

(f) Since November 20, 2007, Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and
maintained a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined

of Parent financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls prior to the date hereof, to Parent's auditors and audit committee
(i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls.

 

 

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of Parent. Parent has not, since

officer of Parent, as applicable) have made all certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct.

(or, with respect to any post-effective amendment or supplement, at the time
such post-effective amendment or supplement becomes effective) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

(b) From the Parent Balance Sheet Date until the date hereof, there has not
been any action taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, if taken

or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,

investigations or proceedings, would be before) or by any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator, that, if determined or resolved adversely in
accordance with the plaintiff's demands, would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44

to be filed with any Taxing Authority by, or on behalf of, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries have been filed when due in accordance with all Applicable
Law (including any extensions), and all such material Tax Returns are true

material Taxes that have become due and payable. Where payment is not yet due

Section 5.16 and Sections 5.08, 5.09, 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 with respect to
Taxes are the only representations and warranties made by Parent and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters relating to Taxes under this Agreement.

opinions, the Merger Consideration is fair to Parent from a financial point
of view.

Section 6.03. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General Prohibitions.

Company Recommendation Change"), (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (v) enter into any

this Section by the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders:

 

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party and its Representatives or financing sources that, subject to the
Company's compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made after the date of
this Agreement a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company reasonably believes will lead to a Superior Proposal and (B)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives or financing sources non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Third Party, in each case pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the confidentiality
agreement dated July 28, 2009 between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that all such information (to
the extent that such information has not been previously provided or
made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party) and (C) take any nonappealable, final action that any
court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take; and

 

 

(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal
made after the date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (it being agreed
that, for all purposes of this Agreement, Evercore Group L.L.C. qualifies as
such an advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) solely in response to
an Intervening Event;

 

 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii)
only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such action is required by its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law; provided that the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal permitted by clause
(ii) above (or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii)),
unless (x) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least three
Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so and
attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such
Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third
party making the Superior Proposal, and (y) Parent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not make, within three Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of
the Company as such Superior Proposal such that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines that such action is no longer required by its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new three Business Day period under this
proviso); provided, further, that the Board of Directors of the Company may
not make an Adverse Company Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event permitted by clause (ii) above unless the Company (x)
has provided Parent with written information describing such Intervening
Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of it, (y) keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event and (z) has provided to Parent at least
three Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to make such an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and Parent does not make, within
three Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that results
in the Board of Directors of the Company determining that such action is no
longer required by its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law. During the three Business Day period prior to its
effecting an Adverse Company Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause
(ii) above (or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii)),
the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

 

 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14D-9 under the 1934
Act with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken
or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03; provided
that any such action taken or statement made that relates to a Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, U.S. Subsidiary, through any
of its or any of its Subsidiaries' operating divisions engaged in advising
clients in respect of share voting matters in the ordinary course of
business, shall be permitted in the ordinary course of business to make any
recommendation to its clients with respect to the Merger and/or any Company
Acquisition Proposal and any such recommendation shall not be deemed to be an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change or be imputed to the Board of
Directors.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(b)(i) unless the Company
shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall
continue to advise Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status
and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party.
In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives)
of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any notification to the Company (or any
of its Representatives) that a Third Party is considering making a Company
Acquisition Proposal or of any request received by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) for information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has
made, or that has notified the Company (or any of its Representatives) that
it is, or to the knowledge of the Company is, considering making, a Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and
conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request, and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that describes any material terms or conditions of any Company Acquisition
Proposal. Any material amendment to any Company Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Company Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's
compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

 

 

(d) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and
its Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each Third Party, if any, that has executed
a confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date
hereof in connection with its consideration of any Company Acquisition
Proposal return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and
all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contains, reflects or analyzes that information) (if and to the extent
permitted by such confidentiality agreement with each such Third Party),
unless the Company has previously received a certification from any such
Third Party that such confidential information has been returned or
destroyed.

 

 

(e) Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a Company Acquisition Proposal for at least a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or substantially
all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, are more favorable and provide greater value to all of the
Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder, which the Board
of Directors of the Company determines is reasonably likely to be
consummated without undue regulatory delay relative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

 

Section 6.04. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (a) upon prior written request to the Company,
give Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and
records of the Company, (b) furnish Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (c)
instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in its
investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted
in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder.

 

 

Section 6.05. Tax Matters. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, except as set forth in Section 6.05 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or
change any material Tax election, change any annual tax accounting
period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, file any material
amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax refunds, enter into any
material closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim, audit or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset or
other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit
to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the
effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
(including any real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid
by the Company when due, and the Company shall, at its own expense, file all
necessary

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tax returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees,
and, if required by Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other
documentation.

Parent agrees that:

 

 

Section 7.01. Conduct of Parent. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
except as contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or as required by Applicable Law, or unless the Company
shall otherwise consent in writing, conduct its business in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and, to the extent consistent with and
not in violation of any other provisions of this Section 7.01, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) preserve intact its business organizations and
relationships with Third Parties, (ii) maintain in effect all of its foreign,
federal, state and local licenses, permits, consents, franchises, approvals
and authorizations which, if abandoned, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (iii) keep available the services of its
present officers and employees and (iv) subject to the right of contract
parties to exercise applicable rights, maintain relationships with its
customers, lenders, suppliers and others having material business
relationships with it in a manner which would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or to the extent the Company shall
otherwise consent in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries to:

 

 

(a) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution (whether in
cash, stock or property or any combination thereof) in respect of its capital
stock, except for dividends paid by a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent to Parent or to any of Parent's other direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries;

 

 

(b) amend Parent's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar
organizational documents (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material
respect the rights of the holders of Parent Stock;

 

 

(c) change Parent's methods of accounting, except as required by concurrent
changes in GAAP or in Regulation S-X of the 1934 Act, as agreed to by its
independent public accountants;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) issue, deliver or sell, or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of,
any shares of any shares of Class B common stock, $0.01 par value, of Parent;
and

 

 

(e) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

Section 7.02. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 7.03. Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Subsidiary. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement by the parties, Parent shall cause
the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary to approve and adopt this
Agreement, in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

 

 

Section 7.04. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

Section 7.05. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

 

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the later of (i) the sixth anniversary
of the date on which the Effective Time occurs and (ii) the expiration of any
statute of limitations applicable to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to an act or omission referred to below, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses (provided
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances to the extent required by Applicable Law) to, the present
and former officers and directors of the Company (each, an
"Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any
other Applicable Law or provided under the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof or indemnification
agreements with directors of the Company in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law.

 

 

(b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Section 7.05(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all indemnification or other
agreements referred to in the immediately preceding sentence in effect on the
date hereof. Further, for six years after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (or
in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving
Corporation) shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are set forth in the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as of the date of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers '
liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at
or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under
the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the selection of such tail policy and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent with respect thereto; provided, further, that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such "tail" policy exceeds 200% of the per
annum rate of premium paid by the Company for its existing policies, then the
Company shall procure the maximum coverage that will then be available at an
equivalent annual premium equal to 200% of such rate. If the Company for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof;
provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 200% of the amount per annum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been made
available to Parent; and provided further that if the aggregate premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05. The rights of this
Section 7.05 are intended to be for the benefit of the Third Parties
referenced in this Section 7.05 and their respective heirs and
legal representatives.

 

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.05 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition,
the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this
Section 7.05. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

 

Section 7.06. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the shares of
Parent Stock to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration to be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

 

Section 7.07. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year following
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to all employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates ("Continuing Employees")
and for so long as they continue such employment during such period
compensation and benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are in
the aggregate substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one
year following the Effective Time, Parent agrees that any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is terminated other than for Cause or
performance related reasons will be paid severance in amounts and on terms
that are no less favorable than the more favorable of (i) severance that is
provided to employees of the Company under severance plans of the Company in
effect immediately prior to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Effective Time and (ii) severance provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent under Parent severance plans in effect at the time of
such termination of employment. Parent agrees that the Company may amend its
stock incentive plans such that the Adjusted Options and Company Restricted
Shares will be subject to accelerated vesting if the holder of any such
Adjusted Option or Company Restricted Share is terminated without cause
following the Effective Time (or in the case of Adjusted Options or Company
Restricted Shares held by directors of the Company, resigns concurrent with
the Effective Time and exchanges such securities (and/or shares issuable
upon exercise thereof) for the Merger Consideration). Following the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company agree to cooperate and consult as to the
composition of the work force and the assignment of job functions and
positions to employees of each of Parent and the Company.

 

 

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a
participant, such Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting thereunder, and calculating the amount
of vacation and severance benefits for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
such past service credit) to the same extent that such service was recognized
as of the Effective Time under a comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated.

 

 

(c) With respect to any medical plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which any Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid and for out-of-pocket maximums
incurred prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

 

 

(d) With respect to the annual bonus for which any employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is eligible under any of the Company's annual
incentive plans with respect to the year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall administer each such plan and make payment of all amounts owed
thereunder at the ordinary time bonuses would otherwise be paid under such
plan in accordance with the terms of such plan; provided that the amount
payable to such employee under such plan shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of such plan and based on the attainment of applicable
performance goals as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mutually determined in the reasonable, good faith judgment of Parent and the
Company.

 

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.07 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending any employee
benefit plan, (iii) obligate Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Affiliates to retain the employment of any
particular employee or (iv) confer any rights or benefits on any person other
than the parties to this Agreement.

establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action (or otherwise
agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of the material
businesses, assets or properties of Parent or the Company or any of their

Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries generating
revenues in calendar year 2009 that is in excess of 5% of the aggregate

calendar year, shall be considered to be a "material business" for these
purposes); provided, further, that if so requested by Parent, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to take any action identified in foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) reasonably necessary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Applicable Law,
provided that such action is conditioned on the Closing and does not reduce
the amount or delay the payment of the Merger Consideration. Parent and the
Company shall promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide any
necessary information with respect to, and provide the other (or its counsel)
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority or
any other Person or any other information supplied by such party with any
Governmental Authority or any other Person or any other information supplied
by such party to a Governmental Authority or any other Person in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and

use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the

any other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permitting the other
party to review in advance any written communication planned to be given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority
or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other

meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this
Section 8.01(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel
regarding Foreign Antitrust Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the
recipient or any of its affiliates unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent as the case
may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective outside counsel regarding
Antitrust Law to comply with this Section 8.01(b). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 8.01(b), materials provided to the other
party or its counsel may be redacted to remove

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged
communications.

 

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make appropriate filings under any antitrust Applicable Law and
Foreign Antitrust Laws, including an appropriate filing of a Notification and

that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or such Foreign Antitrust Laws,
and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain consents, approvals
or authorizations under Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as
practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period
provided for in the HSR Act.

 

 

Section 8.02. Financing. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary to consummate
and obtain the Financing on substantially the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letter, as adjusted by the Agreed Marketing Terms, if
any, including reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter and, if entered into prior to the Closing, the definitive
documentation with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including "flex" provisions contained therein) (the "Definitive
Financing Agreements"), (ii) negotiate and execute Definitive Financing
Agreements on terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions in connection therewith), as adjusted by the
Agreed Marketing Terms, if any, and, upon execution thereof, deliver a copy
thereof to the Company, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries in the Commitment Letter and
Definitive Financing Agreements that are within its control and comply
with its obligations thereunder, and not take any action that would prevent
the availability of the Financing, (iv) seek to enforce its rights under
the Commitment Letter and Definitive Financing Agreements in the event of a
breach or failure to fund by the financing sources that materially impedes or
materially delays Closing, including by seeking specific performance against,
the parties thereto (including the Commitment Party under the Commitment
Letter). In the event that all conditions to the Financing have been
satisfied, or upon funding will be satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such
Financing to fund on the Closing Date (including by seeking specific
performance to cause such lenders and other Persons to fund such Financing)
the portion of the Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall have the right from
time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any
of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreements, and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for
all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative
financing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sources, provided that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreements that amends the Financing and/or substitution
of all or any portion of the Financing shall not (A) expand upon or amend in
any way that is adverse to the Company the conditions precedent to the
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter or (B) be reasonably expected
to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the availability of the
Financing and/or the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall be permitted to reduce the
amount of Financing under the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreements in its reasonable discretion, provided, that Parent shall not
reduce the Financing to an amount committed below the amount that is
required, together with the financial resources of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, including cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries, to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of
any Required Amounts), and provided, further, that such reduction shall not
(A) expand upon or amend in any way that is adverse to the Company the
conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter
or (B) be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impede or materially
delay the availability of such reduced Financing and/or the consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Financing unavailable, in
each case, on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions in
connection therewith) contemplated in the Commitment Letter, as adjusted by
the Agreed Marketing Terms, if any, and such portion is reasonably required
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the payment of any Required Amounts), Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event alternative financing from the same
and/or alternative financing sources in an amount sufficient to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the payment of any Required Amounts), upon terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent than those in the Commitment Letter, as adjusted by the
Agreed Marketing Terms, if any, and, if obtained, will provide the Company
with a copy of the documentation with respect to such alternative financing.
Parent shall give the Company prompt oral and written notice (but in any
event not later than 48 hours) after Parent becoming aware (i) of the
occurrence of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or
Definitive Financing Agreements or of any condition not likely to
be satisfied, (ii) of any termination or waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Commitment Letter, (iii) that any of the Financing
Parties no longer intends to provide the Financing or (iv) that any portion
of the Financing is not available to consummate the Merger. Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to arrange, obtain and/or consummate the Financing and shall provide

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copies of the principal documents related to the Financing (excluding fee
letters and engagement letters, except to the extent that such documents
contain any conditions to funding or "flex" provisions (excluding provisions
related solely to fees and economic terms (other than covenants) agreed to by
the parties)) on a periodic basis of no less frequently than once a month and
as may otherwise be reasonably requested by the Company. In the event that
Parent commences an action to seek specific performance to enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements and/or
cause the financing sources to fund the Financing (any such action, a
"Financing Action"), Parent shall (x) keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of the Financing Action and (y) at the reasonable request of
the Company, make Parent's employees and legal advisors reasonably available
to discuss the status of, and material developments with respect to, the
Financing Action (subject in all cases to preserving all legal privileges).
For the avoidance of doubt, the syndication of the Financing to the extent
permitted by the Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to violate Parent's
obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to, use its
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and/or the Financing Parties in connection with the Financing,
including (i) providing information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Parent and the lenders and other financial institutions and
investors that are or may become parties to the Financing (including the
parties to the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements)
(the "Financing Parties") (including information to be used in the
preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations,
financial projections and prospects of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries customary for such financing or reasonably necessary
for the completion of the Financing by the Financing Parties) to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent to assist in preparation of customary offering
or information documents to be used for the completion of the Financing as
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (as adjusted by the Agreed Marketing
Terms, if any) or the Definitive Financing Agreements, (ii) participating in
a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers for the Financing and senior management
and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the
Company), presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with the
rating agencies, in each case as are reasonably necessary for the completion
of the Financing by the Financing Parties, (iii) assisting in the
preparation of documents and materials, including (A) any customary
offering documents and bank information memoranda (including public and
private versions thereof) for the Financing, and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations, in each case as are reasonably necessary for the
completion of the Financing by the Financing Parties, (iv) cooperating with
the marketing efforts for the Financing (including consenting to the use of
the Company's and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its Subsidiaries' logos; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as reasonably determined by the Company), (v) provide
reasonable assistance in the preparation of and executing and delivering (or
using reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), and causing its
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use reasonable best efforts to obtain

principal financial officer of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to
solvency immediately before giving effect to the Merger in substantially the
same form as delivered by Parent with appropriate conforming changes), legal
opinions or other documents and instruments relating to guarantees and other
matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
as necessary and customary in connection with the Financing, (vi) provide
reasonable assistance in connection with Parent's preparation of and entering
into one or more credit agreements, currency or interest hedging agreements,
or other agreements; provided that no obligation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such agreements or amendments shall be effective
until the Effective Time, (vii) as promptly as practicable, furnishing Parent
and the Financing Parties with financial and other information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and/or the Financing Parties to assist in preparation of customary offering
or information documents to be used for the completion of the Financing
as contemplated by the Commitment Letter, as adjusted by the Agreed
Marketing Terms, if any, or the Definitive Financing Agreements, (viii) using
its reasonable best efforts, as appropriate, to have its independent
accountants provide their reasonable cooperation and assistance, including
participation in due diligence sessions, (ix) using its reasonable best
efforts to permit any cash and marketable securities of the Company and

using its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Financing Parties
benefit materially from the existing lending and banking relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and that the Financing Parties have the benefit
of "clear market" provisions in the Commitment Letter relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (xii) as soon as available and in any event within 45
days after the end of each fiscal quarter subsequent to the fiscal year 2009,

Company shall have performed a SAS 100 review, (xiii) cooperating reasonably
with Parent's financing sources' due diligence and with their efforts to
obtain guarantees from the Company and its Subsidiaries and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain and perfect security interests in the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries intended to constitute collateral securing such financing, with
such cooperation occurring prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, but

that would result in a breach of any of its Material Contracts prior to the
consummation of the Merger; and provided, further, until the Effective Time

alternative financing that Parent may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) unless reimbursed or indemnified
by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company; provided, further,
that (I) all non-public or other confidential information provided by the
Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Section 8.02 shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be permitted to disclose such
information in accordance with the Commitment Letter and (II) the Company
shall be permitted a reasonable period to comment on those portions of the
confidential information memorandum circulated to potential financing sources
that contain or are based upon any such non-public or other confidential
information.

 

 

(c) Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with
the cooperation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives contemplated by this Section 8.02 (other than in

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries in writing for inclusion in
customary offering documents and (B) for any of the foregoing to the extent
the same is the result of willful misconduct or bad faith of the Company, any
such Subsidiary or their respective Representatives.

 

 

(d) In the event that the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreements are amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in accordance with
Section 8.02(a), or if Parent substitutes other debt or equity financing for
all or a portion of the Financing in accordance with Section 8.02(a), each of
Parent and the Company shall comply with its covenants in Section 8.02(a),
(b), (c), (e) and (g) with respect to the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreements, as applicable, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified and with respect to such other debt or equity financing to
the same extent that Parent and the Company would have been obligated to

10.01(d)(i), 11.04(c) and 11.08 relating to the Commitment Letter,
the Definitive Financing Agreements and/or the Financing shall be deemed to
refer to the Commitment Letter, the Financing Definitive Agreements and/or
the Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and

but is unable to agree on the terms and conditions of such covenants to be
offered to the market (including if the Commitment Party is unwilling to
agree to offer to the market any Specified Term (whether or not the
Commitment Letter contains a provision addressing the subject matter of such
Specified Term) and regardless of whether the terms and conditions of the
covenants offered by the Commitment Party is consistent with terms and
conditions for such covenants then being offered in the credit markets by
other lenders for comparable transactions and comparable credits) by
March 29, 2010, then (x) Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement upon giving written notice to the Company of such failure at any
time on or after March 29, 2010 and prior to April 2, 2010 (the "Financing
Covenant Negotiation End Date") and (y) upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 11.04(b)(i)(B), the Company shall
have no right, and hereby irrevocably waives any such right, to make or
assert any claim, against any Person (including Parent and the
Related Persons) based on Parent's inability or failure to reach agreement
with the Commitment Party under this Agreement prior to the Financing
Covenant Negotiation End Date, including that Parent has breached any
obligation or covenant contained in this Agreement, including this
Section 8.02; provided that following the Financing Covenant Negotiation End
Date, this Section 8.02(e) (other than this proviso) shall be of no further
force and effect and Parent shall thereafter be obligated to use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate and obtain the Financing as
provided in this Section 8.02 (it being understood that Parent shall in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any event be obligated to accept the Agreed Marketing Terms and other
covenants offered by the Financing Parties that are consistent with the terms
and conditions for such covenants then being offered in the credit markets by
other lenders for comparable transactions and comparable credits).

 

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (x) "Agreed Marketing Terms"
means those terms and conditions as to the covenants that Parent and the
Commitment Party have agreed to be offered to the market in accordance with

acquisitions basket acceptable to Parent;

 

 

(ii) that the interest rate margins with respect to any term loan facility
included in the Financing will reduce upon certain leverage levels being met;

 

 

(iii) that the interest rate margins with respect to the Financing will
default to the highest applicable margins specified in the Definitive
Financing Agreements upon the occurrence of any event of default thereunder
only if the "required lenders" thereunder so elect;

Section 8.03. Proxy Statement; Registration Statement. (a) As promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall prepare and
file the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (in which the Proxy
Statement will be included) with the SEC. The Company and Parent shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the 1933 Act as soon after such filing as practicable and to
keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. Unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse
Company Recommendation Change, the Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of approval
and adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective.
Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly provide copies, consult with
each other and prepare written responses with respect to any written comments
received from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and advise one another of any oral comments received
from the SEC. Each party shall be given an opportunity to participate in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement comply in all material respects with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1934
Act, respectively.

 

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby under the 1933 Act and
the 1934 Act and applicable state "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other
party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. No
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
shall be filed without the approval of both the Company and Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement
so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party hereto that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and Parent; provided that
the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or
supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to any party.

 

 

Section 8.04. Public Announcements. The initial press release announcing
the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint press release agreed to by Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release, having any communication with the press (whether
or not for attribution), making any other public statement or scheduling any
press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except in
respect of any public statement or press release as may be required by
Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release or
make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or
conference call before such consultation and, solely in the case of the
Company, without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that
if disclosure is required by Applicable Law or any such listing agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide the
other parties with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any
disclosure so that such other parties may seek an appropriate protective
order and confidential treatment; provided, further, that the restrictions
set forth in this Section 8.04 shall not apply to any release, announcement
or disclosure made or proposed to be made following an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change; provided, further, that, except as may be required by
Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association (and subject to the foregoing provisos),
neither party shall disclose, disseminate or file, including with the SEC or
the New York Stock Exchange, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule without the consent of the other party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 

Section 8.05. Client Consents. (a) If consent or other action is required by
Applicable Law or by the Investment Advisory Agreement of any Client for the
Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client to continue after Closing, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall, or shall cause the appropriate Subsidiary to, send a notice ("Notice")
complying with Applicable Law and the terms of such Client's Investment
Advisory Agreement informing such Client of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and requesting such consent in writing and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent, and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, thereafter use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain such consent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that any consent required
for any Investment Advisory Agreement with a Client to continue after the
Closing shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement (A) upon
receipt of a written consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing
Date or (B) if no such written consent is received, if 45 days shall have
passed since the sending of written notice ("Negative Consent Notice") to
such Client (which Negative Consent Notice may be included in the Notice sent
to such Client as long as the Company provides an additional notice to such
Client at least 15 days prior to the expiration of such 45 day period)
requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (I) of the
intention to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
will result in a deemed assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory
Agreement; (II) of the Company's (or the applicable Subsidiary's) intention
to continue to provide the advisory services pursuant to the existing
Investment Advisory Agreement with such Client after the Closing if such
Client does not terminate such agreement prior to the Closing; and (III) that
the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client
continues to accept such advisory services for a period of at least 45 days
after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice without termination;
provided that if the parties reasonably determine that written consent is
required under Applicable Law or the respective Investment Advisory
Agreement, such consent shall be deemed given only upon receipt of the
written consent requested in the Notice prior to the Closing Date;
provided, further, that, in any case, no consent shall be deemed to have
been given for any purpose under this Agreement if at any time prior to the
Closing such Client notifies the Company or the applicable Subsidiary in
writing that such Client has not so consented or has terminated, or given
notice of termination of its Investment Advisory Agreement, and in each case
such notice has not been revoked.

 

 

(c) Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all consent materials to be used by the Company or any Subsidiary prior to
distribution. The Company shall promptly upon their receipt make available to
Parent copies of any and all substantive correspondence between it and
Clients or representatives or counsel of such Clients relating to the consent
solicitation provided for in this Section 8.05.

 

 

(d) The Company agrees that the information that is contained in any Notice
or Negative Consent Notice to be furnished to any Client (other than
information that is or will be provided in writing by or on behalf of Parent
or its Affiliates specifically for inclusion in such Notice or Negative
Consent Notice) will be true, correct and complete in all material respects.
Parent agrees that the information provided by it or its Affiliates (or on
their behalves) in writing for inclusion in any Notice or Negative Consent
Notice will be true, correct and complete in all material respects.

 

 

(e) In connection with obtaining the Client consents required by this Section
8.05, at all times prior to the Closing, the Company shall keep Parent
informed of the status of obtaining such client and other consents and, upon

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parent's request, make available to Parent copies of all such executed client
or other consents. In addition, prior to entering into a new Investment
Advisory Agreement with any Client, the Company shall, or shall instruct the
applicable Subsidiaries to, inform each potential Client or counterparty to
such agreement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
include in the applicable contract a provision disclosing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the consent of the potential Client or
counterparty thereto (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law).

officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger

other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise

under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any
Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of that party contained
in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a) or
Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied; and

 

 

(e) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a) not to be satisfied not to be satisfied;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.07 shall
not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any
party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.

 

 

Section 8.08. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the
Company and will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect
to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

 

 

Section 8.09. Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration. Prior to

and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the deregistration of

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cured within 30 days following receipt of notice thereof to Parent or, by its

warranty in this Agreement relating to the Financing (regardless of whether

without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, except as set forth in Section 11.04(e), no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
to the other party hereto (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party's
stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such party) resulting from any willful and
intentional material breach of this Agreement. The provisions of this
Section 10.02 and Sections 8.02(c), 8.02(e), 11.01, 11.04, 11.06, 11.07,

(i) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by each of the Company and Parent while structuring and pursuing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement: 

 

 

(A) The Company agrees to pay a fee (the "Company Termination Fee") to
Parent in the amount of $50 million:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i) or
10.01(c)(iii);

 

 

(2) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(ii); or

 

 

(3) if (x) the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) (but solely if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at least two Business Days prior to such termination) or
Section 10.01(b)(iii), (y) prior to such termination (in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i)) or the Company Stockholder
Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii)), a
Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and (z)
within 18 months following the date of such termination, the Company shall
have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or recommended to
its stockholders a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this
clause (3), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50.1%").

 

 

The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by the Company to Parent within two Business Days
following the termination of this Agreement in the case of clause (1) above,
immediately before and as a condition to such termination in the case of
clause (2) above and within two Business Days of the event giving rise to the
payment of the Company Termination Fee in the case of clause (3) above.

 

 

(B) Parent agrees to pay a fee (the "Parent Termination Fee" and, together
with the Company Termination Fee, the "Termination Fees") to the Company
in the amount of $100 million if this Agreement is terminated:

 

 

(1) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.01 (other than the condition
set forth in Section 9.01(e)) and 9.02 (other than (A) the condition set
forth in Section 9.02(d) and (B) those other conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case
of clause (B), which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were
the date of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the date of
such termination; provided that no Parent Termination Fee shall be payable by
Parent pursuant to this clause (1) if the failure of the condition set
forth in Section 9.02(d) to be satisfied is caused by the Company's willful
and intentional material breach of Section 8.02(b) or the Company's right to
receive the Parent Termination Fee terminates in accordance with
Section 11.13(b); or

 

 

(2) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(iv).

 

 

The payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by Parent to the Company within two Business Days
following the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination by
the Company and concurrently with such termination in the case of a
termination by Parent.

 

 

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment to be made by any party under
this Section 11.04(b) shall be payable only once to such other party with
respect to this Section 11.04(b) and not in duplication even though
such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.

 

 

(c) Reimbursement. Upon termination of this Agreement (A) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) by Parent pursuant
to Section 10.01(c)(i) or 10.01(c)(iii) or (C) by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(d)(ii), the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates
for 100% of their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including (x)
all ticking fees, structuring fees, interest, expenses and other costs or
fees incurred in relation to the Commitment Letter, the Financing Definitive
Agreements and the Financing, (y) fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources (including
counsel thereof), experts and consultants to Parent, its Affiliates and their
Representatives and (z) any expenses reimbursed or reimbursable by Parent
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.02(c)) up to $10 million in the
aggregate actually incurred by any of them in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Any reimbursement pursuant to this
clause (c) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds by
the Company to Parent no later than two Business Days after submission by
Parent of reasonable documentation thereof to the Company.

 

 

(d) Other Costs and Expenses. Each party hereto acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, the other party would not have entered into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

81  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promptly to pay any amount due to the other party pursuant to Section 11.04,
it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by the other party in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against such party for such amount, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required
to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

 

 

(e) Exclusive Remedy. Each party agrees that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 10.02), in the event that
any Termination Fee is paid to a party in accordance with this Section 11.04,
the payment of such Termination Fee (or any settlement thereof) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its Related Persons against the
other party and its Related Persons for, and in no event will the party being
paid any Termination Fee or any of its Related Persons seek to recover any
other monetary damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or
equity with respect to, (i) any loss suffered, directly or indirectly, as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (ii) the termination
of this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this
Agreement, or (iv) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any
breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and upon payment
of any Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 11.04, neither the
party paying such fee nor any Related Person of such party shall have any
further liability or obligation to the other party or any of its Related
Persons relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except that each party shall remain
obligated under the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 11.04(c) and
Section 11.04(d)). For purposes of this Section 11.04(e), "Related Person"
means, with respect to a party, any former, current or future, direct or
indirect, stockholder, director, officer, manager, employee, agent,
Representative, Affiliate or assignee of such party, or any former, current
or future director, officer, manager, employee, agent, Representative,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing.

 

 

Section 11.05. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. (a)The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of such party
that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a
reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The inclusion of any information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Material Adverse
Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business.

 

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that in no event shall any information contained
in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk
Factors" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
any representations and warranties of any party contained in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Sections 7.05
and 11.08, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Sections 7.05, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the
Financing Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of Sections
11.04(e), 11.08, 11.13(b) and 11.13(c).

 

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing
shall be null and void.

 

 

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

 

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state
court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

83  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Financing Agreements or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the federal and New York State courts located in the City of New
York, Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

 

Section 11.09 . WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

 

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by
any other electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as
physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signatures.

 

 

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitute the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

 

Section 11.13. Specific Performance; Remedies. (a) The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, except as limited by
Section 11.04(e), that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement, in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court
having jurisdiction over the question, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that in the event that the Company or any of its
Related Persons (i) seeks to recover any monetary damages or (ii) seeks to
pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy (including specific
performance or any other equitable remedy) of any kind in any suit, action,
cause of action or claim of any kind or description against Parent or any of
its Related Persons based on any matter arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company's right
to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(i)(B)
shall immediately and automatically terminate and Section 11.04(b)(i)(B)
shall thereupon be null and void; provided that this sentence shall not apply
to any suit, action or proceeding brought by the Company after such time that
the Parent Termination Fee has become payable pursuant to
Section 11.04(b)(i)(B) solely to enforce the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 11.04(b)(i)(B) and any associated
costs and expenses (together with interest) in accordance with
Section 11.04(d).

 

 

(c) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, regardless of whether or not this Agreement is terminated, no
party or any of its Related Persons shall have any liability for any monetary
damages (other than in accordance with the terms of Section 11.04(b)(i)(B))
for (i) any breach by such party of any of the covenants or agreements or any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement, (ii)
any liabilities or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) any loss
suffered, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated, except to the extent resulting from any willful and
intentional material breach of this Agreement by such party (in which case
the parties acknowledge and agree that such damages and losses shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include
to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

85  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be
deemed in such event to be damages of such party).
