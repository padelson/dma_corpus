Subject to Sections 2.1(b), 2.1(d), 2.1(e), 2.1(f) and 2.2, each common share, without par value, of Wendys issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Common Shares_ ", and each, a " _Common Share_ " ), including Restricted Shares, shall at the Effective Time, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive 4.25 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the certificate(s) representing such Common Shares as provided in this Article II, and all Common Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Triarc and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Common Share that is held by Triarc or any Subsidiary of Triarc immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by Wendys or any Subsidiary of Wendys (as treasury stock or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each common share, without par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and those shares of the Surviving Corporation shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing common shares of Merger Sub will for all purposes represent the number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Wendys or Triarc shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period (but not as a result of the settlement of any Wendys Share-Based Award or the exercise of any outstanding Wendys Stock Option or Triarc capital stock-based award or Triarc capital stock options), the Exchange Ratio will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 (e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any shareholder who was a record holder of the Common Shares as to which such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of the Wendys Meeting and who shall not have voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Wendys Meeting and who files with Wendys within 10 days after such vote at the Wendys Meeting (the " _Dissenters Determination Date_ "), a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for such Common Shares in accordance with Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), unless and until such shareholder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise loses such shareholders rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such shareholder fails to perfect or loses any such rights as a dissenting shareholder, that shareholders Common Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into only the right to receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without interest. From and after the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, each shareholder who has asserted rights as a dissenting
shareholder as provided in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted under those sections of the OGCL.
Wendys shall promptly notify Triarc of each shareholder who asserts rights
as a dissenting shareholder within three Business Days thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time Wendys shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Triarc, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
rights of a dissenting shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL. 

  

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Class A Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Common Shares who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Class A Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, calculated to the nearest ten thousandth (i.e., four decimal places (.xxxx)) by the closing price of a share of Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on the date the Merger becomes effective. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Class A Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement (as defined herein), Triarc shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Wendys to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration.

Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Class A Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive with respect to the Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate after taking into account all Common Shares then held by such holder, and (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(f) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Triarc shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Triarc and Wendys (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ")), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Common Shares, (i) cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to make 

   ##### 

  

    

payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(f), (ii)
certificates representing shares of Class A Common Stock sufficient to issue
the Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Common Shares outstanding

loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Common Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to this Article II (such cash and

dividends or distributions with respect thereto, referred to in subsections

be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d); provided that once the Dissenting
Shares Amount is determined, such amount will be returned in cash to the
Surviving Corporation by the Exchange Agent as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Dissenters Determination Date. 

  

 (d) _Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Certificates_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with respect to the Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Class A Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Common Share which is being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) until such holder shall surrender such Common Share in accordance with this Section 2.2. After the surrender of a Common Share in accordance with this Section 2.2, such holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole shares of Class A Common Stock represented by such Common Share. 

  

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Triarc, Wendys and the Exchange Agent is entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (f) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Wendys will be closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Common Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any former holder of Common Shares who has not surrendered its Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of such Certificates. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time (or, in any particular case, prior to such 

   ##### 

  

    

earlier date on which any Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency), the Merger Consideration
issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Wendys, Triarc, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

As used in this Agreement, " _Wendy s Material Adverse Effect_" means any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that is materially adverse to the assets, properties, business or financial condition or results of operations of Wendys and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall not include an effect

the financial or securities markets in the United States or elsewhere in the
world, including regulatory, social or political conditions or developments
(including any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war, whether
or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or acts of
terrorism) or changes in interest rates or (b) to the extent resulting from
(i) the announcement of, or compliance with, this Agreement or the
announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other
than for purposes of Sections 3.2(e), 3.3 and 3.9(g) (and the condition

projected financial or operating performance target, but not any underlying
cause of such failure, whether internal or published, for any period ending
on or after the date of this Agreement as well as any change, in and
of itself, by Wendys in any expected or projected financial or operating
performance target as compared with any target prior to the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any change, effect, development,
event or occurrence described in each of clauses (a), (b)(iii), (b)(vii) and
b(ix) above shall not constitute or give rise to a Wendys Material
Adverse Effect only if and to the extent that such change, effect,
development, event or occurrence does not have a materially disproportionate
effect on Wendys and its Subsidiaries as compared to other persons in the
quick service restaurant industry and _provided_ _further_ that the facts,
circumstances or events underlying the change or failure in clauses (b)(iv),
(b)(v), and (b)(x) above shall not be excluded to the extent such facts,
circumstances or events would otherwise constitute a Wendys Material Adverse
Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) Wendys results of operations for the
quarter ended March 30, 2008 and (b) the trend reflected therein shall not
constitute a Wendys Material Adverse Effect.

 (a) Wendys has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished since January 2, 2006 by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (the " _Wendy s SEC Documents_"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment (excluding any amendments made after the date of this Agreement), the Wendys SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Wendys SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to projected financial 

   ##### 

  

    

information provided by or on behalf of Wendys, Wendys represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith by management of Wendys on the
basis of assumptions believed by such management to be reasonable as of the

Wendys has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Wendys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Wendys in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Wendys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). Wendys management has completed assessment of the effectiveness of Wendys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 30, 2007, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Wendys has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to Wendys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors and to Triarc (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Wendys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves executive officers or employees who have a significant role in Wendys internal controls over financial reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Wendys, Wendys has not identified any significant deficiencies or any material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting. There are no outstanding loans made by Wendys or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of Wendys.

consistent with past practice since December 30, 2007 that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Wendys
Material Adverse Effect and (d) liabilities or obligations which have been
discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the date
of this Agreement, neither Wendys nor any Subsidiary of Wendys has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent
or otherwise, and whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of Wendys and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes

All Converted Stock-Based Awards shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Wendys Stock-Based Plan (or any other agreement to which such Converted Stock-Based Award was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time) except as otherwise provided herein. Prior to the Effective Time, Wendys shall make such amendments and take such other actions with respect to the Wendys Stock-Based Award Plans as shall be necessary to effectuate the adjustment referred to in this Section 5.5(a)(ii), including notifying all participants in the Wendys Stock-Based Award Plans of such adjustment. 

   

 (iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Common Shares (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. For the purposes of Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, all references to Common Shares shall be deemed to include Restricted Shares. 

   

 (iv) Wendys shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time, each performance unit granted under the Wendys Share Plans (each, a " _Wendy s Performance Unit_"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to Common Shares and shall be converted into the right to receive, following the Effective Time at the time specified under the applicable Wendys Share Plan under which it was granted, an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to (A) the product of (i) the Fair Market Value (as defined in such applicable Wendys Share Plan of a Common Share on the date on which the Effective Time occurs and (ii) the number of Common Shares underlying such Wendys Performance Units that are deemed to have vested in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement less (B) such 

   ##### 

  

   

amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making
of such payment. 

   

 (v) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall make such adjustments and amendments with the consent of Triarc (with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (and provide copies of any documents reflecting such adjustments or amendments to Triarc, at least 10 days prior to the Effective Time) to or make such determinations with respect to Wendys Stock Options, Wendys Share-Based Awards and Restricted Shares as are necessary to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5(a) and to ensure that no holder of a Wendys Stock Option or Wendys Share-Based Award has any right to receive Common Shares following the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (i) Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, for the period immediately following the Effective Time until December 31, 2008, Triarc and the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to employees of Wendys and its Subsidiaries who remain employed with the Surviving Corporation (" _Wendy s Employees_"), (A) base salary (or wages) that are no less favorable than those in effect for each Wendys Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than those in effect for the Wendys Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided the bonus opportunities may be adjusted in order to prevent inappropriate enlargement or dilution) and (C) the existing Wendys employee benefits (excluding (i) benefits under plans providing for the issuance of Common Shares or based on the value of Common Shares and (ii) extended health care coverage other than pursuant to COBRA). 

   

 (ii) Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, from January 1, 2009 until December 31, 2009, Triarc and the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Wendys Employees, (A) base salary (or wages) and annual cash bonus opportunities in the aggregate that are substantially equivalent to those in effect for each Wendys Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) employee benefits (excluding extended health care coverage other than pursuant to COBRA) that, in the aggregate, are not less favorable than the employee benefits (excluding extended health care coverage other than pursuant to COBRA) provided to Wendys Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (iii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Triarc and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Wendys Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Wendys Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Wendys and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Wendys Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Wendys Employee benefit plan in which such Wendys Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with 

   ##### 

  

   

respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (A) each Wendys Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Wendys Benefit Plan in which such Wendys Employee participated immediately
before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Wendys Employee, Triarc
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Wendys Employee and
his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Old Plans of Wendys or its Subsidiaries in which
such Wendys Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and Triarc shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Wendys Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require Triarc or any of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any specific person or persons or to maintain any specific benefit plan or arrangement (other than as required by Section 5.5(b)(i) and (b)(ii)). 

   

 (v) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of Wendys who is a covered person of Wendys for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Common Shares or options or other rights to acquire Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. 

   

 (vi) Prior to the Effective Time, the Triarc Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer, director or employee of Wendys who will be a covered person of Triarc for purposes of Section 16 of shares of Class A Common Stock or options or other rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16. 

   

 (vii) Prior to the Closing, Wendys shall take such actions as are necessary (including making cash contributions) to ensure that the Wendys defined benefit pension plans that are to be terminated pending approval from the IRS (the Crew Plan and the ABP Plan, as described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Wendys 10-K) are not underfunded (that is, the amount of the liabilities of the plan to its participants and beneficiaries (including settlement distribution payments to participants and beneficiaries in respect of the termination of the plan), as measured on the applicable plan termination basis, exceeds the market value of the plans assets available for distribution to the 

   ##### 

  

   

plans participants and beneficiaries) (individually or in the aggregate) by
an amount in excess of $10,000,000 as of the Closing.

   ##### 

  

    

may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the End Date); and (iv) subject to applicable legal

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section 5.6. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Triarc nor Wendys, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to agree, and neither Wendys, Triarc nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall agree without the other partys prior written consent, to take any action or accept any condition, restriction, obligation or requirement with respect to Triarc, Wendys, their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates or their and their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates assets if such action, condition, restriction, obligation or requirements (i) would reasonably be expected to require Triarc, Wendys or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to sell, license, transfer, assign, lease, dispose of or hold separate any material business or assets or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in any material limitations on Triarc or Wendys or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to own, retain, conduct or operate all or a material portion of their respective businesses or assets.

stockholders or Triarc the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver will be
subject to the approval of the stockholders of Triarc. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by Wendys or Triarc in exercising any right
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial
