Contribution Shares) or owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company or Parent) (such non-excepted shares, the "Exchangeable Shares") shall
be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement,
into the right to receive, without interest, either the Per Share Cash Amount
or the Per Share Stock Amount (together, the "Per Share Merger
Consideration"), as applicable and in accordance with the allocations set
forth in the allocation schedule mutually agreed by the Company and Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Allocation Schedule");
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to the Founder, (i) the number of

Shares _divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Stock Amount and (ii) the remaining number of the
Founders shares of Company Common Stock shall convert into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Allocation
Schedule.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the

and without any action on the part of any Party, each limited liability
company interest of Merger Sub I shall be converted into one share of common

after the Effective Time, any and all limited liability company interests of
Merger Sub I shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of

the Subsequent Merger and without any action on the part of any Party, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving
Company issued and outstanding immediately following the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or payable
in respect thereof, and each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub
II shall be unaffected by the Subsequent Merger and shall remain outstanding
as a limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

(i) "Aggregate Cash Amount" means the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount
_multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be
exchanged for the Per Share Cash Amount (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is
net of the share reduction associated with the Contribution Shares) pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_ (the "Number of Cash Allocations") and (B) the
aggregate amount of cash that will be distributed to certain holders of
Company SARs pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_.

 

(ii) "Aggregate Parent Share Amount" means the sum of (A) the Per Share Stock
Amount _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will
be exchanged for the Per Share Stock Amount (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, is net of the share reduction associated with the Contribution Shares)
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_ (the "Number of Stock Allocations") and
(B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be issued to certain
holders of Company SARs pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_ (for the avoidance
of doubt, excluding any Company SARs described in the first sentence of

(iii) "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient, rounded to the nearest one
thousandth (1/1000) of a share, obtained by dividing the Total Consideration
Value by the product of (A) the Reference Price and (B) the sum of the number
of Exchangeable Shares and the number of Contribution Shares, subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)_; _provided_ , that if the
Measurement Price exceeds the Reference Price by 20% or more, then the
Exchange Ratio shall mean the product of (1) the foregoing quotient, (2) 1.2
and (3) the quotient obtained by dividing the Reference Price by the
Measurement Price.

 

(iv) "Measurement Price" means the Parent Average Stock Price for the twenty
(20) full trading days immediately prior to the date on which the condition
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)(i)_ has been satisfied (such date, the

thirty (30) days of the Final Approval Date, then the Measurement Price shall

the Pre-Closing Period as a result of the exercise of Company SARs held by
such Person.

Common Stock has a value equal to the Per Share Cash Amount) other than the
Company SARs that are to be converted into Parent RSU Awards pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)_.

(g) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.02_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time and the holders of such Company
Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of the
Initial Surviving Company, and each certificate (each, a "Company Stock
Certificate,"  _it_ _being_ _understood_ that any reference herein to
"Company Stock Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, (ii) if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Company Stock Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, without any interest thereon, and
(iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(i)_. If, prior to the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there
shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give holders
of Company Common Stock and holders of Company SARs the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger and any such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Parent shall pay to each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares represented by the Company Stock Certificates delivered by such
holder), in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Common Stock held
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and allocated to
receive the Per Share Stock Amount) and (ii) the Reference Price.

(i) _Distributions with Respect to Un-surrendered Certificates_. All shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder of any un-surrendered Company Stock Certificate until the Company
Stock Certificate (or affidavit of

 



-8- 

    

 loss in lieu of a Company Stock Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.06(e)_) is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_.
Subject to applicable Law, following such surrender, there shall be issued or
paid to the holder of record of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange for Company Common Stock in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_ ,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date at or after the Effective Time and prior to surrender, but
with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 

(j) _Founder Escrow Shares_. At the Closing, the Founder shall enter into an
escrow agreement (the "Founder Escrow Agreement"), in a form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Founder and Parent, with a financial institution
of national repute selected by the Founder and reasonably acceptable to Parent
(the "Founder Escrow Agent") providing for (I) the deposit by the Founder
with the Founder Escrow Agent of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(received by the Founder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.06_) equal to the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to all Parent RSU
Awards into which Company SARS have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.04(b)_ (such Parent RSU Awards, the "Protected Parent RSU Awards" and such
shares of Parent Common Stock for so long as they remain in escrow, the
"Founder Escrow Shares") and (II) the deposit by Parent with the Founder
Escrow Agent from time to time of any dividends or distributions paid on the
Founder Escrow Shares. The Founder Escrow Agreement shall provide that (i)
the Founder or his heirs, legal representatives or successors, as applicable,
shall, for so long as Protected Parent RSU Awards are outstanding, retain and
not sell, or otherwise Transfer or subject to any Lien, the Founder Escrow
Shares, (ii) the Founder or his heirs, legal representatives or successors, as
applicable, shall be entitled to direct the investment of any dividends or
distributions paid on the Founder Escrow Shares and to substitute collateral
therefor, (iii) within five (5) Business Days following the issuance of any
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to a Protected Parent RSU Award, the
Founder Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Founder, shall contribute to Parent
pursuant to the Founder Escrow Agreement, for no further consideration to the
Founder (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the remittance to the Founder
of any collateral substituted by the Founder for dividends or distributions
paid on the Founder Escrow Shares), (A) a number of Founder Escrow Shares
equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent pursuant
to such Protected Parent RSU Award and (B) an amount of cash equal to the
dividends or distributions that were paid or deposited in respect of such
contributed Founder Escrow Shares and (iv) within five (5) Business Days
following any forfeiture, cancellation or other termination of any Protected
Parent RSU Award pursuant to which no shares of Parent Common Stock are
issuable, (X) a number of Founder Escrow Shares equal to the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock that would have otherwise been issuable pursuant to
such forfeited, canceled or terminated Protected Parent RSU Award and (Y) the
amount of cash held by the Founder Escrow Agent in respect of any dividends or
distributions that were paid or deposited in respect of such Founder Escrow
Shares shall be released from escrow to the Founder and shall no longer be
subject to any restrictions under the Founder Escrow Agreement. Any collateral
substituted by the Founder for any dividends or distributions paid on Founder
Escrow Shares shall be composed solely of Government Securities. The Founder
shall make Parent whole for any Loss of any amount of dividends or
distributions paid on Founder Escrow Shares that are invested or substituted
at Founders direction to the extent such dividends or distributions are
ultimately payable to Parent pursuant to this subsection (j). Any dividends or
distributions accrued on the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to a
Protected Parent RSU Award will be released to the holder of such
Protected Parent RSU Award within five (5) Business Days of the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of such Protected Parent
RSU Award. In the event that the Protected Parent RSU Award is forfeited,
cancelled or otherwise terminated so that no shares of Parent Common Stock
are issuable pursuant to such Protected Parent RSU Award, any dividends or
distributions accrued on shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Protected Parent RSU Award will be forfeited and will not be

 



-9- 

    

 payable to the holder of such Protected Parent RSU Award. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Founder shall direct the voting of the Founder Escrow Shares,
and shall be entitled to all economic benefits, burdens and payments
resulting from or incidental to his ownership of the Founder Escrow Shares.
For U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income Tax purposes, Parent
and the Founder shall treat (x) the Founder Escrow Shares as having been
issued to the Founder pursuant to this Agreement in consideration for shares
of Company Common Stock and such Founder Escrow Shares and any dividends or
distributions paid thereon as owned by the Founder and (y) the
contribution of any Founder Escrow Shares (and any dividends and
distributions paid thereon) to Parent pursuant to clause (ii) of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.02(j)_ as a "contribution to the capital" of Parent by the
Founder within the meaning of Section 118 of the Code and shall take no
position on any Tax Return or any audit, examination or Action involving any
Taxing Authority inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this sentence
except to the extent required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or analogous provision of state or
local Tax Law). Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of each fiscal
quarter from and after the Closing Date until no Founder Escrow Shares remain
subject to the Founder Escrow Agreement, Parent shall deliver to the Founder a
written statement setting forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to Protected Parent RSU Awards and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock contributed to Parent by the Founder pursuant to this

set forth in the Payout Trial Run.

(b) _Estimated Statement_.

 

(i) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a reasonably detailed statement (the
"Estimated Statement") containing the Companys good faith calculation of the

estimates of the components thereof) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ (the
"Estimated Total Consideration Value"). The Estimated Total Consideration
Value and Estimated Statement (including the Closing Net Book Value) shall be

stock appreciation right in respect of Company Common Stock (a "Company
SAR"), whether vested or unvested by its terms as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company SAR to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company SAR immediately prior
to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per
Share Cash Amount over (B) the exercise price per share of such Company SAR,
less applicable Taxes, which shall be satisfied by the withholding by the
Company of a portion of such cash equal to the applicable withholding Taxes

finally awarded to Parent with respect to the underlying claim.

(b)  _Representative Amount_. Of the Aggregate Cash Amount, an amount equal
to $1,000,000 (the "Representative Amount") (less any applicable Tax

(i) _Escrow Amount_. Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount

investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof,
shall be allocable to Parent for all Tax purposes, and Parent shall pay any
and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to such interest and
earnings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent

(ii) _Representative Amount_. Parent shall be deemed to have paid each
Stockholder his, her or its respective share of the Representative Amount,

Section 3.06 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Closing Cash Amount_. Parent shall deposit with the Escrow and Payments
Agent, for the benefit of and payment to the Stockholders, the Closing Cash
Amount. The applicable Escrow and Payments Agreement shall provide that the
Closing Cash Amount shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow and Payments
Agent, and Parent shall cause the Escrow and Payments Agent to hold and
disburse the Closing Cash Amount, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.06(a)_ and the Allocation Schedule. The Escrow and Payments Agent shall hold
the Closing Cash Amount on behalf of the Stockholders for the sole purpose of
delivering the Closing Cash Amount to the applicable Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Whenever, pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent deposits with the Escrow and Payments Agent amounts to which
Stockholders are entitled, for the benefit of the Stockholders entitled
thereto and payable pursuant to the applicable Escrow and Payments Agreement,
such deposit by Parent satisfies in full Parents obligations to deliver such
amounts to the Stockholders, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 3.06(f)_. The
Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall pay the
costs and expenses of the Escrow and Payments Agent (if any).

 

(b) _Parent to Provide Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 3.03(c)(iii)_, at the Closing, Parent shall make available to: (1) the
Escrow and Payments Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.06_ the amount of cash in immediately available funds payable at the
Effective Time to the Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ (
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund the
portion of the Aggregate Cash Amount that comprises the Escrow Amount); (2)
the Stockholders Representative Retention Account the Representative Amount
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_; and (3) the applicable Stockholders,
through Parents transfer agent, the shares of Parent Common Stock payable at
the Effective Time to such Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

(c) _Delivery of Letters of Transmittal to the Stockholders_. Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate to, no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the anticipated Effective Time, mail or otherwise deliver to each Stockholder
(i) a letter of transmittal in a form mutually agreed upon by Parent and the
Company (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the amounts payable
hereunder in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby. After receipt of such Letter of Transmittal, the Stockholders shall
surrender the Company Stock Certificates to Parent for cancellation, and each
such Stockholder shall deliver a duly completed and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal to Parent. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for
cancellation to Parent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly and
properly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time and the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 3.06(e)_, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall
be entitled to receive from the Escrow and Payments Agent and Parent (solely
in respect of the Aggregate Parent Share Amount) in exchange therefor, the
Per Share Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_ (with respect to the portion of the Aggregate Cash
Amount that such holder is entitled to, if any, _less_ , as applicable, (1)
the amount to be retained as the Escrow Amount and (2) the share of the
Representative Amount to be deposited into the Stockholders Retention Account
with respect to such holder, in each case, determined in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule) and the Company Stock Certificates so surrendered shall
be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate outstanding
after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all purposes thereafter, to
evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and the
other amounts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02(h)_ pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.02_ in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock (without interest) into
which such Company Common Stock shall have been so converted. No Per Share
Merger Consideration will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company Stock
Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate pursuant hereto.

 



-14- 

    

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration is to be disbursed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.06_ to a Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company
Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of
the delivery thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the disbursement of such
portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _
3.06(c)_, if any certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
such affidavit to be in such form reasonably acceptable to Parent, delivered
to the Escrow and Payments Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, such
Person shall be entitled to receive, in each case, when and if payable as
contemplated in this Agreement, the amounts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02_
for each share of Company Common Stock owned by such Person immediately prior
to the Effective Time and represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate.

(f) _Escrow and Payments Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time
following the day that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Escrow and Payments Agent to
deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all cash amounts that
have been deposited with the Escrow and Payments Agent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.06_, and any income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to
the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.06(a)_, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be
entitled to look to Parent (subject to the terms of this _Section_ __ _
3.06(f)_) only as a general creditor thereof with respect to any and all
amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ upon the due surrender of such Company Stock
Certificates in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.06(c)_ or an
affidavit of loss as set forth in _ Section_ __ _ 3.06(e)_.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.06_, neither the Escrow and Payments Agent, the Surviving
Company nor any party hereto or any Affiliate thereof shall be liable to a
holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

Section 3.07 _Calculation of Final Total Consideration_ _Value_ _and Related
Payments_.

(a) As promptly as practical, but no later than seventy five (75)
days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders Representative a reasonably detailed statement (the "Final
Statement") containing its final good faith calculation of the Total
Consideration Value (based on its good faith calculation of each component
thereof) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, including such schedules and data
as may be reasonably necessary to support such determinations. Parent agrees
that, following the Closing through the date that the Total Consideration
Value is finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.07_, it
will not take any actions with respect to any accounting books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Estimated Statement is based that would
adversely impact or otherwise impair in any significant respect the ability to
prepare the Final Statement in accordance with this Agreement. The Total
Consideration Value and Final Statement (including the Closing Net Book
Value) will be prepared in a manner consistent with the Payout Trial Run and
will be determined in all instances in accordance with the Accounting
Principles, it being understood that the determination of the
Total Consideration Value and Final Statement (including the Closing Net Book

 



-15- 

    

 Value) will not be subject to the Financial Accounting Standard Boards
current expected credit loss ("CECL") requirements. During the forty-five (45)
days following delivery of the Final Statement to the Stockholders
Representative, Parent shall afford the Stockholders Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access during business hours upon reasonable notice
to the books and records of the Surviving Company relating to the preparation
of the Final Statement.

(b) If the Stockholders Representative objects to Parents determination of
the Total Consideration Value reflected in the Final Statement, the
Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent in writing of such
objection(s) within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Final Statement
from Parent (an "Objection Notice"). The Objection Notice shall specify the
items or amounts contained in the Final Statement that are being disputed and
describe in reasonable detail the basis for such disputes, including the
Stockholders Representatives calculation of any such amounts. Matters as to
which the Stockholders Representative may object in the Objection Notice will
be limited to whether the Final Statement (1) is accurate and completely and
properly reflects the Total Consideration Value, based on the Stockholders
Representatives review of the information provided to it in accordance with
the terms hereof, including the accuracy of such schedules and supporting
data and (2) was prepared in a manner consistent with this Agreement.

(c) If the Stockholders Representative delivers an Objection Notice with
respect to one or more items in the Final Statement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.07(b)_, then the Stockholders Representative and Parent
shall, in good faith, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such disputed items.

(d) In the event that Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable
to resolve the disputed items within forty-five (45) days after delivery of
the Objection Notice, either Parent or the Stockholders Representative may
demand that such disputed items be referred to Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP,
and if Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP is not willing or able to serve in such
capacity, to such other independent accounting firm of nationally recognized
standing as is mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders
Representative to finally resolve such disputed items. The independent
accounting firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator, and shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Final Statement as to which the
Stockholders Representative has disagreed and shall not assign a value to
any such item or amount that is (1) greater than the greatest value for such
item or amount assigned by Parent in the Final Statement, on the one hand, or
the Stockholders Representative in the Objection Notice, on the other hand
or (2) less than the smallest value for such item or amount assigned by Parent
in the Final Statement, on the one hand, or the Stockholders Representative
in the Objection Notice, on the other hand. The determination of such
independent accounting firm shall be made as promptly as possible and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error. Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall be permitted to submit such data and
information to such independent accounting firm as such parties deem
appropriate; _provided_ , that any such materials shall also be submitted to
Parent or the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be. Parent and
the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall each
pay their own fees and expenses incurred under this _Section_ __ _ 3.07(d)_.
All expenses and fees incurred in connection with the independent
accounting firm shall be borne by the Stockholders Representative, on the
one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
amount actually contested but not awarded to the Stockholders Representative
or Parent, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by
the Stockholders Representative and Parent ( _i.e._ , the non-prevailing
party will bear the greater proportion thereof).

 



-16- 

    

(e) Parent, the Surviving Company and the Stockholders Representative shall,
and shall cause their respective accountants to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Final Statement and the calculation of the Total
Consideration Value and in the conduct of reviews referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.07_, including making available, to the extent reasonably
necessary, the Records and personnel.

(f) The Total Consideration Value as determined pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 3.07_ shall be used to determine the Total Consideration Value in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Final
Total Consideration Value" means the Total Consideration Value (x) as shown
in Parents calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.07(a)_, if no
Objection Notice with respect thereto is duly and timely delivered pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 3.07(b)_; or (y) if an Objection Notice is duly and
timely delivered, (A) as agreed by Parent and the Stockholders Representative
or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the independent
accounting firms calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.07(d)_.
Once the Total Consideration Value is determined in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.01_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 3.07_, the following shall occur:

(i) if the Final Total Consideration Value exceeds the Estimated
Total Consideration Value, the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to
the Escrow and Payments Agent, the Surviving Company and Parent in writing,
the Stockholders Representatives determination of the excess payable to
each Stockholder in accordance with the Allocation Schedule, and Parent shall
pay the total of such excess due to the Stockholders to the Escrow and
Payments Agent within three (3) Business Days following delivery of such
written notice, such amount to be distributed to the Stockholders by the
Escrow and Payments Agent by check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Stockholders, _provided_ that the aggregate amount payable to all
Stockholders pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.07(f)(i)_ shall not exceed
the excess of the Final Total Consideration Value over the Estimated Total
Consideration Value, and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if payment of amounts
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.07(f)(i)_ would reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify
as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code,
then the Stockholders Representative shall provide written notice to Parent
to such effect together with the determination of the excess payable to each
Stockholder, and Parent shall instead make payments pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.07(f)(i)_ in a combination of cash and Parent Common Stock
in the same proportions as reflected in the Allocation Schedule, provided that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock owed to the
applicable Stockholders pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso shall
be calculated using the Reference Price; or

(ii) if the Estimated Total Consideration Value exceeds the Final Total
Consideration Value, the Escrow and Payments Agent shall, solely to the extent
of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, pursuant to the applicable
terms of the Escrow and Payments Agreements, pay or cause to be paid such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated in writing by Parent from the Escrow Fund; _provided_ that the
aggregate amount payable to Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
3.07(f)(ii)_ shall not exceed the excess of the Estimated Total Consideration
Value over the Final Total Consideration Value.

 

(g) The Stockholders Representative shall revise the Payout Spreadsheet to
reflect any changes to the amounts reflected thereon resulting from changes
in the Final Total Consideration Value (as compared to the Estimated Total
Consideration Value), and shall provide such revised Payout Spreadsheet to the
Escrow and Payments Agent promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following the determination of the Final Total Consideration
Value.

Section 3.08 _Closing of the Company_ __ _s Transfer Books_. At the
Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as Stockholders, and the stock transfer books of

 



-17- 

    

 the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books at or after the Effective Time. If, at or after the Effective
Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Company
or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be
exchanged as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.06_.

Section 3.09 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the explicit
terms of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Company or Parent with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
I, Merger Sub II and the Company, in any case subject to and in accordance
with the terms herein, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub I, in the name of
Merger Sub II, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 3.10 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Company and the Escrow and Payments Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such
amounts under applicable Tax Law. Prior to making any such deduction or
withholding, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or the Escrow and
Payments Agent, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Person with respect to which such deduction or withholding is to
be made with reasonable advance written notice of the intention to make such
deduction or withholding and shall reasonably cooperate with such Person to
mitigate or reduce any such deduction or withholding;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply to any amounts
appropriately treated as compensatory payments for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes. To the extent amounts are deducted or withheld pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.10_ and timely paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority or other applicable Person in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

such Key Stockholder, enforceable against each such Key Stockholder, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

Stockholder that is a trust of this Agreement and the consummation by each
such Key Stockholder of the Transactions are within such trustees and such
Key Stockholders powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action
on the part of such trustees. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by such trustees and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other Parties hereto) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each such Key Stockholder, enforceable against each such Key
Stockholder, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

Section 5.02 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements by each Key Stockholder nor the consummation by each

and each Stock Electing Key Stockholders compliance with, the
representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of
each Stock Electing Key Stockholder set forth herein in order to
determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of each
Stock Electing Key Stockholder to acquire the Parent Common Stock.

the Company Disclosure Letter or any certificate delivered pursuant to this

Person has made or is making, and each Key Stockholder expressly disclaims
reliance upon, any representations, warranties or statements relating to
Parent or its Subsidiaries whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those
expressly given by Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in _Article VI_ ,
the Parent Disclosure Letter or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding Parent furnished or made
available to each Key Stockholder, or any of its Representatives. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Key Stockholder acknowledges
that, except as expressly provided in _Article VI_ , the Parent Disclosure
Letter or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, no

consummation of the Transaction, except that Parent has employed Goldman
Sachs and Co. LLC as its financial advisor.

Section 6.08 _Available Funds_. Parent has, or will have available to it
prior to the Closing, all funds necessary to satisfy its obligations
hereunder.

 

Section 6.09 _Securities Law Compliance_. Parent has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters and in investments of this type
that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Company and of making an informed investment decision. Parent understands that
the Companys equity securities may not have been registered under the
securities Laws of any jurisdiction, including the Securities Act, and may
only be transferred pursuant to registration or an applicable exemption under
the Securities Act and any other applicable securities Laws. Parent is
acquiring the Companys equity securities for its own account, for the
purpose of investment only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of applicable Law. Parent has not,
directly or indirectly, offered the Companys equity securities to anyone or
solicited any offer to buy the Companys equity securities from anyone, in
each case that would have the effect of bringing such offer and sale of the
Companys equity securities by Parent within the registration requirements of
the Securities Act or the securities Laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 6.10 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the Execution Date, there are no
Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing (a)
against Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II that challenge the validity or
consummation of the Transactions, (b) against Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger
Sub II that would reasonably be likely to materially impair the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to perform their obligations under this
Agreement or (c) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events,
would reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.11 _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all forms,
statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act
since December 31, 2018 (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or
furnished since December 31, 2018 and those filed or furnished subsequent
to the date hereof including any amendments thereto, the "Parent Reports").
Each of the Parent Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their respective dates (or,
if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the
Parent Reports did not, and any of the Parent Reports filed or furnished with
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) Parents consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
notes thereto) contained in the Parent Reports were or will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
interim consolidated financial statements, where information and
footnotes contained in such financial statements are not required to be in
compliance with GAAP), were or will be prepared from and

 



-46- 

    

 in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
and in each case such consolidated financial statements fairly presented, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Parent and the consolidated Subsidiaries of
Parent as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end adjustments).

(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file since December 31, 2018 with (A) the Federal
Reserve Board and (B) any other Regulatory Authority, including under
the rules and regulations of the FDIC or the Utah Department of Financial
Institutions, as applicable, and have paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report
or statement or to pay such fees and assessments would not, individually or
taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events, reasonably be
likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of their respective
dates, such reports and statements complied in all material respects with all
the Laws of the applicable Regulatory Authority with which they were filed.

Section 6.12  _Controls_. Parent (a) maintains controls and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating
to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities, and (b) for the past three (3) years, has disclosed to
Parents outside auditors (1) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries which are reasonably likely
to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting.

to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money
penalty by, or since January 1, 2017, has adopted any policies, procedures or
board resolutions at the request or suggestion of the Regulatory Authorities
or other Governmental Authority that currently restricts the conduct of its
business in any material respect or that in any material manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management
policies, its management or its business, nor has Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to Parents Knowledge, orally, since
January 1, 2017, by any Regulatory Authority or other Governmental Authority
that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any
Regulatory Agreement.

(b) There are (1) no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
disputes, proceedings or controversies between Parent or any of its Affiliates
and any Governmental Authority, and (2) no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened investigations (except for routine examinations conducted
by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary course of the business of the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) or supervisory or enforcement actions by a
Governmental Authority with respect to Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including any Order, memorandum of understanding, written agreement or other
similar agreement, or extraordinary supervisory letter, formal or informal),
that would, in the case of each of _clauses (1)_ and  _(2)_ , reasonably be
likely to (A) materially impair or materially delay the ability of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to perform their obligations under this Agreement, (B)
materially impair the validity or consummation of the Transactions, (C)
materially restrict Parent, the Surviving Company or Parent Bank in any way in
the operation of their respective businesses following the Closing or (D)

complied in all material respects with, and is not in material default or
violation under, any applicable Law, (2) been conducting operations at all
times in compliance in all material respects with applicable financial
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of all Anti-Money Laundering Laws
and (3) established and maintained a system of internal controls designed to
provide compliance in all material respects by Parent and its Subsidiaries
with applicable financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the
Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Since January 1, 2017, none of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee or agent of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (in each case, acting in their capacities as such), has,
directly or indirectly, (x) used any corporate funds of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for unlawful contributions, unlawful gifts, unlawful
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity, (y)
made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic governmental officials or
employees from corporate funds of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of influencing such individuals actions or decisions in his or her
official capacity or (z) made any unlawful bribe, unlawful rebate, unlawful
payoff, unlawful influence payment, unlawful kickback or other similar

in money, property or services, to obtain favorable treatment in securing
business or to obtain special concessions for Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in the case of _clauses_ __ _ (x)_, _(y)_ and _(z)_ , which
would result in a violation by such Person of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977 or any similar Law, or is currently subject to any United States
sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United
States Treasury Department. Since January 1, 2017, neither Parent nor any of

or revocation of any such material Permit or proceeding related thereto is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably likely, and
(C) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is not in default under or violating
any such material Permit, except for default or violations the existence of
which would not be reasonably likely to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of such material Permits is subject to
termination as a result of the execution of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transactions.

Section 6.15 _Reorganization_. None of Parent and its Subsidiaries is aware of

materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, to consummate the Transactions or (b) would cause or

warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein such that it would be

_Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Companys or Parents
(as applicable) unintentional failure to give notice under this _Section_ __ _

_ 7.03_.

Section 7.04 _Access and Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject

confidentiality obligation to a third party that the third party has refused
to waive or modify or (iii) providing such access would reasonably be
expected to result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other
applicable privilege or protection. The Parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the immediately preceding
proviso apply. No investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall
alter any representation or warranty given hereunder by the Company or any

received pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall be governed by the

Stockholders Representative or any of the Key Stockholders in breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.05(b)_), (2) is made available to the
Stockholders Representative or any of the Key Stockholders by any other
Person, _provided_ that such Person is not known to the recipient to be bound
by a duty of confidentiality with respect thereto, or (3) has been or is
subsequently independently developed by the Stockholders Representative or
any of the Key Stockholders without use of or reference to Transaction
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing, the Stockholders
Representative and the Key Stockholders shall be permitted to disclose
Transaction Confidential Information (1) as required by Law, (2) as requested
by regulators with supervisory jurisdiction over such person, (3) to
directors, officers, employees, accountants, advisors, partners and investors
of the Stockholders Representative, the Key Stockholders or such Key
Stockholders Affiliates or its and their investment funds, or, in the case
of the Stockholders Representative, to the Stockholders, in each case, who
have a need to know such information and (4) as required for the Key
Stockholders or its Affiliates or its and their investment funds
normal fund raising or reporting activities in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, including by providing such

neither the Stockholders Representative nor any Key Stockholder will be

commence or participate in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise), to any third party to obtain any such required
third-party consent.

-56- 

    

Section 7.09 _Cooperation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.05_, (a) each Party shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to (1) refrain from taking any actions that would reasonably be
likely to impair, delay or impede the Closing and (2) without limiting the
foregoing, use reasonable best efforts to cause all Closing Conditions of the
other Party to be met as promptly as practicable and in any event on or before
the Outside Date and (b) each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably
apprised of the status of the matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including, in the case of the Company, with respect to any
negotiations related to obtaining the Required Consents.

Section 7.10 _Information Security_. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as possible, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after a determination that a data breach involving any information concerning
an individual that would be considered nonpublic personal information or
otherwise protected under applicable Law, including any individuals
financial account information, has occurred that the Company reasonably
determines either (1) impacts the Company and in respect of which notice is
required to be provided to any Governmental Authority or (2) has a reasonable
likelihood of materially harming any material part of the normal operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 7.11 _Financial Statements_. Following the date hereof, the Company
will prepare and furnish to Parent as soon as they become available, and in

the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law, Parent will cause the Surviving
Company to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
and the Company Bank to its present and former directors and officers (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) determined as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO Indemnified Persons") pursuant to the Company
Certificate or the Company By-laws or any of the indemnification agreements
set forth on Section 7.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such present or former directors or
officers who are parties thereto (in each case, as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing, but only with respect to such obligations in effect as of the
Execution Date) (the "Company Indemnification Provisions"), to indemnify the
DandO Indemnified Persons against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, losses or damages with respect to
claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time that are asserted prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that, if the Company Indemnification Provisions provide for advancement of
expenses, Parent or the Surviving Company shall only advance expenses as
incurred by such DandO Indemnified Person if such DandO Indemnified Person
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such DandO Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. The
Surviving Company shall reasonably cooperate with the DandO Indemnified Person,
and the DandO Indemnified Person shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and the
Surviving Company, in the defense of any such claim.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to purchase tail insurance coverage under the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy for the DandO Indemnified Persons in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent, which shall provide
the DandO Indemnified Persons with coverage for six (6) years following the
Closing Date (1) in an amount not less than the existing coverage and (2) that
shall have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured Persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage maintained by
the Company as of the Execution Date; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company
shall not be required to expend pursuant to this Agreement, on an annual
basis, more than an amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the annual
premium paid by the Company for coverage for its current policy year for such
insurance, and if the premium therefor would be in excess of such amount,
the Company shall

 



-57- 

    

 purchase such policy with the greatest coverage available as to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time as is available for a cost not exceeding
that premium amount. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain the
tail insurance coverage in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 7.12_: (1) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, (2) is intended to benefit each DandO Indemnified Person and their
respective heirs, (3) is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
against Parent or the Surviving Company, (4) shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, as applicable, and
shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Persons, and (5) shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any DandO Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ without the
written consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Person.

 

Section 7.13 _Vendor Onboarding_. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in good faith with Parents pre-Closing vendor review
and onboarding preparatory process with respect to each vendor or
subcontractor engaged by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation
shall include, at Parents reasonable request, (a) making available any
relevant documentation relating to such vendor or subcontractor that is in the
Companys or its Subsidiaries possession and (b) exercising any contractual
rights, or in the absence of such contractual rights, using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any additional documentation of such vendor or
subcontractor for Parent, in each case, in accordance with (and subject to the
exceptions set forth in)  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_. In the event that Parent, in
consultation with the Company, determines that any existing vendor or
subcontractor of the Company does not meet Parents vendor onboarding
requirements, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in good faith to develop a plan for the termination, and (if
requested by Parent) replacement, of such vendor or subcontractor at or
promptly following the Closing; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 7.13_ shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any action or
omit to take any action prior to Closing that the Company reasonably
determines would adversely affect its or its Subsidiaries relations with any
vendor or subcontractor engaged by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or to
incur prior to Closing any out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses
in connection with any such termination or replacement, or to enter into
prior to Closing any agreements or arrangements in connection with any such
termination or replacement.

 

Section 7.14 _Founder Non-Competition_. For a period of three (3) years
following the Closing Date, except as set forth in Section 7.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter or with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Founder shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in (including as a director,
officer, employee, partner, consultant, agent or advisor), or manage or
supervise personnel engaged in, any business in the United States that (A)
issues, originates or services for third parties, credit card accounts and
credit card receivables, (B) acts as an acquiring bank for merchants or
independent sales organizations, (C) originates or acquires, or services for
third parties, secured consumer installment loans for the purchase of
recreational vehicles or (D) originates unsecured consumer installment loans
(such business, the "Competing Business"), in each case other than on behalf
of Parent and its Affiliates, or own any interest in any Person directly or
indirectly engaged in a Competing Business other than Parent and its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ to the
contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ shall not restrict the Founder from
acquiring, owning or holding a passive investment of up to five percent (5%)
of the outstanding equity securities or similar interests of any Person. The
Parties acknowledge that the covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ are
necessary in order to induce Parent to enter into and consummate the
Transactions, are required by Parent in connection with the Transactions, and
that Parent would not enter into and consummate the Transactions without the
agreement of the Founder to the covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _
7.14_. The Founder agrees not to challenge the reasonableness or
enforceability of the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ in the
future. In the event that any of the provisions of this 

 



-58- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, scope,
geographic, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed reformed in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, scope, geographic or other limitations
enforceable under applicable Law. The Founder further acknowledges that a
violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ would cause immeasurable injury to
Parent and that, in the event of a breach by the Founder of this _Section_ __
_ 7.14_, Parent will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the
event of any such breach, Parent shall be entitled to seek such equitable and
injunctive relief as may be available to restrain the Founder from the
violation of the provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction and
injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond or proving
special damages. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as prohibiting
Parent from pursuing any other remedies available at law or equity for such
breach, including the recovery of damages.

 

Section 7.15 _Seller Names_. Within six (6) months after the Closing, the
Founder shall cause the Persons set forth on Section 7.15 of the Company
Disclosure Letter to (i) change its corporate name and trade name to, in each
case, a name that does not include any Restricted Name; (ii) cease, and take
all necessary actions to cease, all use and display (whether physical or
electronic) of all Restricted Names and use commercially reasonable efforts in
accordance with the applicable Persons best practices to destroy materials
bearing or incorporating the Restricted Names, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
this, _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 7.15(ii)_ shall not
require any Person to cease (1) use of the Restricted Names in a nominative
manner in textual sentences referencing the historical relationship between
such Persons, on the one hand, and the Founder, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, which references are factually accurate, (2)
retention of copies of any books, records and other materials that, as of the
Closing, contain or display the Restricted Names and such copies are used
solely for internal or archival purposes (and not public display) or (3) use
the Restricted Names to comply with applicable Laws or for litigation,
regulatory or corporate filings and documents filed by such Persons with any
Governmental Authority; and (iii) terminate the Trademark License Agreement,
dated November 2, 2016, between Wildcat, Inc. and CardWorks Acquiring, LLC;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, CardWorks Acquiring, LLCs
indemnification obligations with respect to claims and liabilities accrued
prior to termination shall survive such termination indefinitely.

 

Section 7.16 _Termination of_ _Related Party Contracts_. In connection with
the Closing, except for those agreements set forth on Section 7.16 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Key
Stockholders (with respect to Related Party Contracts to which they are a
party) shall take such actions as may be necessary to terminate each Related
Party Contract and pay in full any amounts owing thereunder at or prior to the
Closing with no further Liabilities or obligations of the Company or its
Affiliates or such Key Stockholders from and after the Closing (other than
those certain provisions thereof and obligations and Liabilities thereunder
that expressly survive such termination by their terms), and, in connection
therewith, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any and all
claims against the Company and its Affiliates or against any Key Stockholder
with respect to such agreements to be released. Any termination, release or
other agreements used to effect the foregoing shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to each of Parent and the Company. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company and the Key Stockholders shall take
such actions as are necessary to cause all shares of Company Common Stock that
are held in the escrow account contemplated by the Existing Escrow Agreement
to be released to the Founder immediately prior to Closing.

(a) Effective upon the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the Key Stockholders, in each case on behalf of itself and its

Section 7.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter or any employment, compensation
or similar agreement, but, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein

hereby agrees that it will not seek to recover any amounts in connection

but, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or therein).

(b) Effective upon the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, hereby
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly waives, acquits, remises,
discharges and forever releases each of the Key Stockholders and their
Affiliates from any and all Liabilities and obligations to the Company and
its Affiliates of any kind or nature whatsoever, for or by reason of any

Company, on behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, hereby agrees that
it will not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder
from the Key Stockholders and their respective Affiliates (except as provided
for in this Agreement or any of the other agreements executed and delivered in
connection herewith, but, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or

its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, including by causing

articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary,
to effect, immediately following the Effective Time or at such later time as
Parent may determine, the Bank Merger pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement.

Section 7.19 _Investor Rights Agreement_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Parent, each Stock Electing Key Stockholder and certain employees of the
Company shall enter into an investor rights agreement, which shall become
effective at the Effective Time, and which shall be in a form
mutually acceptable to the parties thereto (the "Investor Rights Agreement").

Section 7.20 _Restrictive Shares and Legends_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Stock Electing
Key Stockholders covenant that shares of Parent Common Stock received in
connection with the Merger may be disposed of only pursuant to an effective
registration statement under, and in compliance with the requirements of, the
Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and in compliance with any applicable state, federal or foreign securities
Laws. The Stock Electing Key Stockholders agree that all certificates or other
instruments representing the Parent Common Stock received in connection with
the Merger will bear a legend (the "Private Placement Legend") substantially
to the following effect and that appropriate no-transfer restrictions may be
issued to Parents transfer agent:

 



-60- 

    

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT WHILE A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

(b) Upon the request of a Stock Electing Key Stockholder, if at any time
the restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws are no longer applicable, upon receipt by Parent of an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that the Private
Placement Legend is no longer required under the Securities Act or applicable
state Laws, Parent shall promptly cause the Private Placement Legend to be
removed from any certificate for any shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 7.21 _Key Stockholder Approval; New Stockholders_.

 

(a) The Key Stockholders hereby consent to and approve this Agreement and the
Transactions for all purposes under applicable Law (including Sections 615
and 903 of the NYBCL) and agree to waive any applicable appraisal, dissenters
or similar rights in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. In
providing such consent and approval, the Key Stockholders acknowledge
the terms and conditions hereof, including the termination right provided
solely to the Founder under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)_.

 

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days after each New Stockholder Event, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a signed
written consent and approval in a form reasonably requested by Parent, of each
Stockholder who becomes a Stockholder after the date hereof (a "New
Stockholder Event") and, if obtained, deliver such written consents to
Parent as promptly as possible.

(c) The Key Stockholders shall not Transfer any shares of Company Common Stock
held by them prior to Closing (in each case, other than to any Affiliate of
such Key Stockholder that executes a joinder to this Agreement as a condition
to the consummation of such Transfer or, in the case of the Founder, as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(a)_).

forth in Section 7.21(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Exchange Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated

Section 7.23 _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. Parent has bound the
RandW Insurance insuring Parent for Losses due to breaches of representations
and warranties of the Company and of the Key Stockholders under _Article IV_
and _Article V_. Parent shall cause the RandW Insurance to provide that the
insurer has no subrogation rights against any of the Key Stockholders (except
for Fraud), and Parent will not amend the subrogation or third-party
beneficiary provisions contained in the RandW Insurance benefitting the Key
Stockholders or otherwise amend or modify the RandW Insurance in a manner
adverse to any of the Key Stockholders without the prior written consent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of such Key Stockholder.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
effectiveness of the RandW Insurance is not a condition to the Closing and that
Parent shall remain obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article X_ , to consummate the Transactions.

Section 7.24 _Extended Reporting Period_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to extend the reporting
period of any expiring Insurance Policy associated with management liability
and cyber insurance programs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
maximum term permitted for each such expiring Insurance Policy pursuant to
the terms thereof. Any additional premium payable by the Company in respect of
any such extension shall (i) not be factored into the determination of Closing
Net Book Value (to the extent paid by the Company prior to the Effective
Time) or (ii) be borne by Parent (to the extent paid by Parent after the
Effective Time).

writing, be provided with (a) base salary or base wage and target cash annual

Continuing Employees base salary as of the applicable date and (ii) the
amount of such Continuing Employees 2019 annual bonus expressed as a
percentage of his or her base salary as of the last day of the 2019 calendar

 accrued by the Company as of the Closing Date for the 2020 annual incentive
pool shall be paid in cash to the Continuing Employees and the remaining
portion of the 2020 total annual incentive pool may be paid to the Continuing
Employees in a mix of cash and Parent equity awards consistent with the past
practice of Parent, except that no Continuing Employee will receive a
proportion of equity greater than a similarly situated Parent employee. With
respect to the annual incentive awards of the Continuing Employees for the
2021 performance year, such awards may be paid to the Continuing Employees in
a mix of cash and Parent equity awards consistent with the past practice
of Parent, except that no Continuing Employee will receive a proportion of
equity greater than a similarly situated Parent employee. Nothing contained in
this Section 8.01 shall prevent Parent from increasing a Continuing Employees
base salary or wage rate and reducing his or her target cash annual incentive
opportunity for the same performance year by an equal amount. Without limiting
clause (b) of the first sentence above, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing
Employee whose employment terminates during the one-year period commencing at
the Effective Time with severance benefits under Parents severance plan
determined (i) on a basis no less favorable than that applicable to similarly
situated Parent employees, (ii) without taking into account any reduction
after the Closing Date in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee,
and (iii) taking into account each Continuing Employees service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the
Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 8.02 _Service Credit_.

 

(a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent in which
any Continuing Employees participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to credit all service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,
including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and determining
level of benefits under any such employee benefit plan, to the extent that
such service was recognized under a similar Employee Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such service shall be credited to the extent such service
crediting would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service.

(b) Parent shall waive participation waiting periods and limitations on
benefits related to any pre-existing conditions of the Continuing Employees
and their eligible spouses and dependents for purposes of participation in any
health plans sponsored by Parent in which such Continuing Employees become
eligible to participate following the Closing Date. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to Continuing
Employees following the Closing Date, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by Continuing Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under
similar Employee Plans that are health plans in the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs, to the extent that such expense was recognized under the
Employee Plan in which the Continuing Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time (e.g., Parent PPO plans will recognize Company PPO year-
to-date in-network accumulators for Continuing Employees who enroll in a
Parent PPO and Parent HDHP will recognize Company HDHP year-to-date in-network
accumulators for Continuing Employees who enroll in a Parent HDHP). The
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
data necessary for Parent to recognize in-network annual deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses in accordance with Section 8.02(b) prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with Parents commercially reasonable requirements.

Section 8.03  _Company 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, if
requested by Parent in writing no later than twenty (20) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date and subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.03, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Companys 401(k) Plan (the
"Company 401(k) Plan") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that

 



-63- 

    

 the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not
later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Effective Time. If the
Company terminates the Companys 401(k) in accordance herewith, prior to the
Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall
take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to the
Company 401(k) Plan or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan
designated by Parent (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") or both to permit each
Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash and promissory notes evidencing any loans from the Company
401(k) Plan in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed or
distributable to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the
Parent 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee who was eligible to participate
in the Company 401(k) Plan preceding the Effective Time shall become a
participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable (and
no later than thirty (30) days) following the Closing Date. The Company shall
not be required to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective
Time, unless Parent provides the Company with satisfactory evidence that the
Continuing Employees shall not experience a gap in participation in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan of more than thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.04 _Medical Flexible Spending Account Plan_. Prior to the Effective
Time, if requested by Parent in writing no later than May 15, 2020 (or such
later date as the Company may agree, if it is not reasonably expected that the
Closing Date will occur by July 1, 2020) and subject to the last sentence of
this Section 8.04, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the Company Medical Flexible Spending Account Plan (the "MFSA Plan"), the
Company shall cause the MFSA Plan to be terminated effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time, with respect to claims that are incurred by eligible
participants following the date of termination of the MFSA Plan.
Notwithstanding the termination of the MFSA Plan or the occurrence of the
Effective Time, eligible participants shall continue to be entitled to submit
and receive reimbursement for claims incurred on or prior to the date of
termination of the MFSA Plan until the later of ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date and March 31, 2021. In the event that Parent requests that the
MFSA Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which will be subject
to review and approval by Parent) not later than two (2) days immediately
preceding the Effective Time. Each Continuing Employee who becomes eligible
to participate in the Parent healthcare flexible spending account plan (the
"Parent HFSA") following the Effective Time shall be eligible to elect to
participate in such Parent plan with respect to the year in which the Closing
Date occurs for the full maximum annual amount under such Parent plan. Each
Continuing Employee who was eligible to participate in the MFSA Plan prior to
the Effective Time shall be eligible to participate in the Parent HFSA as
soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than thirty (30) days) following
the Closing Date. The Company shall not be required to terminate the MFSA Plan
prior to the Effective Time, unless Parent provides the Company
with satisfactory evidence that the Continuing Employees shall not experience
a gap in participation in a healthcare flexible spending account plan of more
than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.05 _Section_ __ _ 280G_. At least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, (1) the Company shall submit for approval by the Stockholders,
in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder
(the "280G Stockholder Vote"), any payments under an Employee Plan in effect
on the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to constitute a
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a "Parachute
Payment") on behalf of each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) and which are
irrevocably waived by such individual under item 2 hereof, (2) prior to the
distribution of the 280G Stockholder Vote materials, the Company shall take
reasonable efforts to obtain an irrevocable waiver of the right to any
Parachute Payment (in the absence of the 280G Stockholder Vote) from each of
the applicable "disqualified individuals" (as defined under Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations 

 



-64- 

    

 promulgated thereunder) whose Parachute Payments would be subject to the
280G Stockholder Vote, and (3) the Company shall have delivered to Parent
complete copies of all disclosure and other related documents that will be
provided to the Stockholders in connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote in a
manner providing Parent with sufficient time to review and comment thereon,
and shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments of Parent thereon.

Section 8.06 _Employee Communications_. Prior to making any general written or
oral communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the Transactions, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the
other party with a copy of the intended communication (whether to be
delivered in writing or orally). Each of Parent and the Company shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the proposed communication,
and each party shall consider any such comments in good faith. 

Section 8.07 _Other_ (b) . Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to, assume and honor all Employee Plans in accordance with their terms.
Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans that have been provided to Parent
prior to the Execution Date will occur at the Effective Time. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall take the actions set
forth in Section 8.07 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 8.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this
_ARTICLE VIII_ or this Agreement is intended to (a) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Employee Plan, (b) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating any
of their benefit plans (including the Employee Plans) in accordance with
their terms, (c) prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee, or (d) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including any Continuing Employee) or any beneficiary or dependent thereof
with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

of the Code, (ii) this Agreement is hereby adopted as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g) and (iii) it is intended that Parent and the Company will each be a
party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the

cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, to qualify, and
shall not take or knowingly fail to take (and shall cause any Subsidiaries of

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



-68- 

    

(b) by the Company, if Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II shall have
breached any representation or warranty or failed to comply with any covenant
or agreement applicable to Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, as the case
may be, which breach or failure to comply (1) would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.02(a)_, and (2) is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and (B) the
Outside Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ if any
Company Party is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder such that it would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)_;

 

(c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any representation or
warranty or any Company Party shall have failed to comply with any covenant
or agreement applicable to such Company Party, which breach or failure to
comply (1) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.03(a)_, and (2) is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
is given by Parent to the Company and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ , that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_ if Parent is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder such that
it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _
10.02(a)_;

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred by
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(d)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose failure to take any action required to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement (including the failure to act in good faith or to use
reasonable best efforts or such higher standard as may be expressly set forth
herein (including as required by _Section_ __ _ 7.06_) to cause the
Closing Conditions of the other Party to be satisfied) shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
before such date;

 

(e) by either the Company or Parent in the event any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger or the Bank Merger; _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(e)_ shall not be available to

shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with
any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially
contributed to, the foregoing; or

(g) by the Founder only, in his personal capacity, (i) at any time during the

the quotient obtained by dividing the Measurement Price by the Reference Price
shall be less than 0.85; or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred
within thirty (30) days after the Final Approval Date, at any time during the
five (5) day period commencing ten (10) days prior to the date on which the
Closing would occur but for the exercise of the

 



-69- 

    

 Founders termination right hereunder if the quotient obtained by dividing
the Parent Average Stock Price for the twenty (20) full trading days
immediately prior to the date that is ten (10) days prior to the date on
which the Closing would occur but for the exercise of the Founders
termination right hereunder (the "Adjusted Measurement Price") by the
Reference Price shall be less than 0.85. If the Founder elects to exercise
his termination right pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)_, he shall
give written notice thereof to Parent (with a copy of such notice provided to
the other Parties). During the five (5) Business Day period commencing with

effect the Closing shall be suspended and Parent shall have the option to
increase the consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common
Stock hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio so that it equals a number
(rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by multiplying (A) the
Exchange Ratio, (B) 0.85 and (C) the quotient obtained by dividing the
Reference Price by the Measurement Price (in the case of a termination
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)(i)_) or the Adjusted Measurement
Price (in the case of a termination contemplated by _Section_ __ _
11.01(g)(ii)_). If Parent so elects within such five (5) Business Day period,
it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the
adjusted Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)_ and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio may have
been so modified). If Parent does not elect to increase the consideration
within such five (5) Business Day period, such termination shall be effective
immediately after the end of the five (5) Business Day period following
Parents receipt of a notice from the Founder that the Founder elects to
exercise his termination right pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(g)_.

Section 11.02  _Notice of Termination_. The Party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Parties.

 

Section 11.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, this Agreement shall
thereupon become null and void and of no further force and effect, except for
the provisions of (a) _ Section_ __ _ 7.05_, (b)  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_
and this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, and (c) _ ARTICLE XIV_. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.03_ shall be deemed to release any Party from any Liability
for any breach by such Person of any term of this Agreement or impair the
right of any Party to compel specific performance by the other Parties of its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ , no Party
shall have any remedy or right to recover for any Liabilities resulting from
any breach of any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement or any failure to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that termination shall not relieve any
Party from Liability for any Fraud (which for all purposes of this Agreement
shall include the element of scienter) or Willful Breach prior to such
termination.

Agreement shall survive in full force and effect until February 28, 2022, at
which time they shall terminate and no claims shall be made for
indemnification with respect thereto under _Section_ __ _ 12.02_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 12.03_ thereafter; _provided_ that the representations and
warranties contained in or made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ shall not

survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Effective Time
indefinitely until fully performed or waived; _provided_ that the

_ARTICLE XII_ shall affect or limit the ability of Parent to recover under
the RandW Insurance for any matters covered thereunder; _provided_ that, without
limiting the right of any Parent Indemnified Person to provide notice of and
otherwise preserve a claim or remedy under this Agreement, recovery shall
first be sought under the RandW Insurance for any matters covered thereunder
before any Parent Indemnified Person may obtain recovery out of the Escrow
Amount or otherwise against the Key Stockholders pursuant to this _Article
XII_.

Section 12.02 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified_ _Persons_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Persons")
shall, unless otherwise stated in _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)_, be entitled to
indemnification solely out of the Escrow Amount (to the extent there is any
remaining Escrow Amount), to the extent that the retention under the RandW
Insurance has not been satisfied or for any claim for Losses subject to a
Permitted RandW Insurance Exclusion, for all Losses that such Parent Indemnified
Person may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of:

(i) prior to their expiration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.01_, a
breach of any representations or warranties made by the Company Parties in
this Agreement (other than a breach of any representations and warranties
contained in or made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ (Taxes)), it being
understood that, for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 12.02_, any
qualifications in the text of any such representation or warranty relating to
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded (other
than any such qualifications in  _Section_ __ _ 4.06(b)_, _Section_ __ _
4.07(b)(2)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 4.09(f)_, _Section_ __ _
4.15(a)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.15(a)(ix),_  _Section_ __ _ 4.15(a)(x)_ and

(ii) any breach or failure by a Company Party to perform any of its pre-
Closing covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any Company
Transaction Agreement to which such Company Party is a party;

 

(iii) any Fraud by or on behalf of a Company Party with respect to this
Agreement or any Company Transaction Agreement to which such Company Party is
a party; and

(iv) any claims brought by a Stockholder of the Company related to the
Transactions, including any claims that have been released pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.17_, any claims related to the matters contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 7.21_ and any claims made by New Stockholders (in each case,
other than claims against Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to any
employment arrangement or to enforce an obligation of Parent Indemnified
Persons under this Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) The Key Stockholders shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless
any Parent Indemnified Person against, or reimburse any Parent Indemnified
Person for, any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_ (other than
with respect to the Fundamental Representations):



     | (A) |

with respect to any claim unless such claim (together with all other claims,
if any, arising out of substantially similar facts, events and circumstances)
involves Losses in excess of $50,000 (nor shall such item be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Parent
Indemnified Persons Losses for purposes of  _clause_ __ _ (B)_ below); and 

---|---|--- 
 



-71- 

         | (B) |

until the aggregate amount of Parent Indemnified Persons Losses that are
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)_
exceeds 50% of the Retention (the "Basket Amount"), after which the Key
Stockholders shall be responsible for the aggregate amount of all Losses
(excluding the Basket Amount), but only if such Losses also meet the
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)(i)(A)_; 

---|---|--- 

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of each of the Key
Stockholders (and the cumulative indemnification obligations paid or to be
payable by the Key Stockholders) under (A) _ Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_
(other than with respect to the Fundamental Representations), (B) _ Section
12.02(a)(ii)_ and (C) _ Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(iv)_ shall in no event exceed
in the aggregate such Key Stockholders share of the Escrow
Amount, determined in accordance with the Allocation Schedule; and

(iii) any indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations), _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(iv)_, to the extent that the retention under the RandW Insurance has
not been satisfied or for any claim for Losses subject to a Permitted RandW
Insurance Exclusion, shall be satisfied solely out of the Escrow Amount to the
extent there is any remaining Escrow Amount; _provided_ , that a Parent
Indemnified Person entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(iii)_ may, at its option, direct the Indemnifying Person to satisfy
such indemnification out of the Escrow Amount or any amount paid as Per
Share Merger Consideration, subject to the limitations set forth in the last
two provisos of this _Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)(iii)_. The maximum amount for
which the Key Stockholders shall be liable under  _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(iv)_
in the aggregate at any time shall be, and in respect of any claims under such
Section the Parent Indemnified Persons shall only have recourse to, the then-
remaining Escrow Amount, in each case (as and to the extent applicable) except
with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation.
Once there is no remaining Escrow Amount, the Key Stockholders shall have no
further liability under _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(iv)_, in each case (as and to the
extent applicable) except with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation. The maximum amount for which any Key Stockholder
shall be liable under this _Section_ __ _ 12.02_ and for all other
indemnification obligations arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
the aggregate, including with respect to payments made from the Escrow Amount
and including with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation and any breach of any covenant or agreement and any claim for
Losses subject to a Permitted RandW Insurance Exclusion, shall not exceed such
Key Stockholders allocable share of such liability, determined in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule, taking into account any claims satisfied
against the Escrow Amount; _provided_ that any liability of the Key
Stockholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_ (solely with respect to
any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation or any
representation or warranty in Article V) or _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(iii)_ in
excess of the Escrow Amount shall be several, as determined in accordance with
the Allocation Schedule (and not joint);  _provided_ , _further_ that in all
cases, liability of a Key Stockholder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.02_ shall
be limited to the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration actually received
or receivable by such Key Stockholder, taking into account any claims
satisfied against the Escrow Amount.

(iv) Any indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 12.02_ that is to be paid from the Escrow Amount shall be
effected within five (5) Business Days after the Final Determination thereof
by release to Parent of the portion of the Escrow Amount sufficient to
satisfy the Final Determination.

Section 12.03 _Indemnification of Company Indemnified_ _Persons_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Parties and their
respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Persons")
against, and reimburse any Company Indemnified Person for, all Losses that
such Company Indemnified Person may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as
a result of:

(i) prior to their expiration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.01_, a
breach of any representations or warranties made by Parent in this Agreement,
it being understood that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 12.03_ any
qualifications in the text of any such representation or warranty relating to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded;

(ii) any breach or failure by Parent to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any Parent Transaction Agreement;
or

(iii) any Fraud by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) Parent shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Company
Indemnified Person against, or reimburse any Company Indemnified Person for,
any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.03(a)(i)_ (other than with respect
to the Fundamental Representations):



     | (A) |

with respect to any claim unless such claim (together with all other claims,
if any, arising out of substantially similar facts, events and circumstances)
involves Losses in excess of $50,000 (nor shall such item be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Company
Indemnified Persons Losses for purposes of  _clause_ __ _ (B)_ below); and 

---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

until the aggregate amount of Company Indemnified Persons Losses that are
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.03(b)_
exceeds the Basket Amount, after which Parent shall be responsible for the
aggregate amount of all Losses (excluding the Basket Amount), but only if such
Losses also meet the requirements of  _Section_ __ _ 12.03(b)(i)(A)_; and 

---|---|--- 

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of Parent under (A) _ Section
12.03(a)(i)_ (other than the indemnification obligation with respect to the
Fundamental Representations) and (B) _ Section 12.03(a)(ii)_ shall in no
event exceed $50,000,000.

 



-73- 

    

Section 12.04 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Person may
have Liability to any Indemnified Person hereunder is asserted against or
sought to be collected from any Indemnified Person by a third party (a "Third-
Party Claim"), such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Person in writing of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated
amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then reasonably
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder and, to the extent
practicable, any other then-known material details pertaining thereto (a
"Claim Notice"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so give a Claim
Notice in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 12.04(a)_ shall not affect the
rights of an Indemnified Person hereunder except, and only to the extent that,
any such failure has an adverse and prejudicial effect on the rights available
to the Indemnifying Person with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days (or such lesser number of
days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by Law or a Governmental
Authority in an Action) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice
Period") to notify the Indemnified Person that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Person
against a Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.04(c)_, the
Indemnifying Person shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Person by
appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its sole expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person. Once the Indemnifying Person has duly assumed the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate
counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Person shall participate in any such
defense at its expense, unless the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person are both named parties to the proceedings and counsel for the
Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual differing
interests between them, and in that case, the Indemnifying Person shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel (in
addition to any necessary local counsel) to the extent such Third-Party Claim
is subject to indemnification or reimbursement under this _ARTICLE XII_.

(c) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 12.04(b)_, if a Third-Party Claim (1)
seeks relief that if granted would result in the imposition of an Order that
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Person or any
of its Affiliates, (2) alleges, or seeks a finding or admission of, a
violation of Law by the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (3) seeks
or would result in a finding or admission that would have a material adverse
effect on other claims made against the Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates, (4) seeks or would result in any monetary Liability of the
Indemnified Person that is in excess (by more than twenty percent (20%)) of
the remaining Escrow Amount, (5) is brought by, or on behalf of, a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates, (6) involves criminal allegations against an Indemnified Person or
any of its respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees or (7)
would materially and adversely affect the ongoing business (including any
dispute with any material customer or employee) of the Company, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any such claim,
an "Indemnified Person Defense Matter"), then, in each case of _clauses (1)_
 _(7)_ , the Indemnified Person alone shall be entitled to contest, defend,
compromise and settle such Third-Party Claim (but, with respect to any such
compromise or settlement, subject to obtaining the consent of the Indemnifying
Person). The Indemnifying Person shall not settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment or other Order resolving such Third-Party Claim in
whole or in part (each, a "Settlement") without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that such consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of the Indemnified Person if such Settlement (1) is or relates
to an Indemnified Person Defense Matter, (2) does not include from the
claimant and such Indemnifying Person an unqualified release of the
Indemnified Persons from all Liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim,
(3) does not provide solely for the payment of money which shall be paid
solely by the Indemnifying Person and imposes no other Liabilities or
obligations of any kind upon the Indemnified Person or (4) includes any
admission of any

 



-74- 

    

 Liability or wrongdoing (including any violation of Law or Order) by any
Indemnified Person. The Indemnified Person shall have a reasonable period to
review and comment upon drafts of any documentation relating to any
Settlement that the Indemnifying Person proposes to enter into, and the
Indemnifying Person shall consider such comments in good faith.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Person (1) elects not to defend the Indemnified Person
against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Person
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (2) is not entitled
to defend the Third-Party Claim as provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.04(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 12.04(c)_, then, in each case, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the defense and resolution
of such Third-Party Claim, and shall reasonably consult with the Indemnifying
Person regarding the strategy for defense of such claim if so assumed, it
being understood that the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification for a
Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of
such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have no Liability with
respect to a Settlement entered into without its consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall cooperate in
order to allow for the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim,
including by providing access to each others relevant business records and
other documents and employees, it being understood that the reasonable out-
of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person relating
thereto shall be considered Losses. The Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Person shall keep each other reasonably informed with respect to
the status of such Third-Party Claim.

(f) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use reasonable
best efforts to avoid production of Confidential Information (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement), consistent with applicable Law, and to cause
access to all relevant business records and other documents and all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

 

Section 12.05 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including
Section 3.02(j)), following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of
this _ARTICLE XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of any Company
Indemnified Person and any Parent Indemnified Person, respectively, for any
Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability or otherwise) that it may
at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in
connection with, (1) any breach of or inaccuracy with respect to any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by Parent or the
Company Parties, respectively, or (2) any breach or failure by Parent or the
Company Parties, respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement set forth herein.

(b) The balance then remaining of the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive recourse for any and all payments that may become owing to the
Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to a claim for indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 12.02_ (other than the indemnification obligations (A) with
respect to the Fundamental Representations and (B) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(iii)_), and no such claim by the Parent Indemnified Persons shall be
asserted against, and the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled
to indemnification from, the Company Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person for a claim for indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 12.02_ (other than the indemnification obligations (A) with respect
to the Fundamental Representations and (B) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
12.02(a)(iii)_) other than by recourse to the Escrow Amount. Any
indemnification of a Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to a claim for
indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 12.02(a)(i)_ with respect, in each

 



-75- 

    

 case, solely to a Fundamental Representation shall be effected first out of
the Escrow Amount to the extent there is any remaining Escrow Amount, and then
if there is no remaining Escrow Amount, by wire transfer or transfers of
immediately available funds from the applicable Key Stockholder (subject to
_Section_ __ _ 12.02(b)(iii)_) to an account designated by Parent within five
(5) Business Days after the Final Determination of such claim. The
disposition of the Escrow Amount shall be governed by the terms set forth
herein and in the applicable Escrow and Payments Agreement.

 

Section 12.06 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement as adjustments to the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration for income Tax purposes, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 12.07 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary:

 

(a) (1) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover more than once for
the same underlying Loss and (2) in no event shall any Parent Indemnified
Person be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of,
and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed to include any liability to the
extent included in, the final determination of the Total Consideration Value,
including the Company Transaction Expenses as finally determined in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.07_.

 

(b) The applicable Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate all Losses in respect of which such Indemnified Person
may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE XII_ after
becoming aware of any event which may reasonably be likely to give rise to any
such Losses.

 

(c) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
_ARTICLE XII_ , for purposes of computing the amount of any Losses incurred
by any Indemnified Person under this _ARTICLE XII_ , there shall be deducted
an amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized in
connection with such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto received or realized by the Indemnified Person, as determined on a
"with and without" basis.

(d) Any indemnification claim by an Indemnified Person which does not result
from a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Person by giving
the Indemnifying Person and the Stockholders Representative prompt written
notice thereof. Such written notice shall summarize the basis for the
indemnification claim based on the information reasonably available at that
time to the Indemnified Person. The failure to give written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Person of its indemnification obligations,
unless, and then solely to the extent that, the rights of the parties from
whom indemnity is sought are actually prejudiced as a result of such failure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notice shall have any effect or
be valid if it is given following the end of any applicable survival period
provided for in _Section_ __ _ 12.01_.

(e) The right of the Indemnified Persons to indemnification pursuant to this
_ARTICLE XII_ will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge
acquired (or capable of being conducted or acquired) at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing,
with respect to any accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance
of or compliance with any covenant or agreement herein.

 

Section 12.08 _Indemnification Notice_. For purposes of this _ARTICLE XII_ ,
(i) if Parent (or any other Parent Indemnified Persons) comprises the
Indemnified Person, any notices to be given to (or delivered by) the
Indemnifying Person shall be given to (or delivered by) the Stockholders
Representative (acting on behalf of the Key Stockholders), and (ii) if Parent
comprises the Indemnifying Person, any notices to be given to (or delivered
by) the Indemnified Person shall be given to (or delivered by) the
Stockholders Representative (acting on behalf of the Key Stockholders).

Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the
consummation of the Merger, including as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
7.21_, or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive consideration payable in connection with the
Merger, each Stockholder shall be deemed to have approved the designation of,
and hereby designates, Fortis Advisors LLC as the Stockholders Representative
for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto, and by execution of this Agreement, the
Stockholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment, to act on behalf
of the Stockholders as the Stockholders exclusive representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to act in the Stockholders
name, place and stead in connection with the Transactions. The power of
attorney granted in this _ARTICLE XIII_ by the Stockholders and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholders
Representative Group hereunder: (1) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable, may be delegated by the Stockholders Representative and shall
survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation or incapacity of any
Stockholder and (2) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Stockholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Amount. Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are and will be entitled
to rely on the actions of the Stockholders Representative taken on behalf of
the Stockholders in connection with the Transactions. By appointing the
Stockholders Representative to act in such capacity, the Stockholders shall
be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and empowered the Stockholders
Representative to:

 

(a) act for and on behalf of the Stockholders in any and all capacities and to
do and perform every act and thing required or permitted to be done, in the
reasonable judgment of the Stockholders Representative, in connection with
the Transactions;

(b) give and receive all notices or documents given or to be given to or by
the Stockholders pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to give and
receive and accept service of legal process in connection with any suit or

(c) engage counsel and such accountants and other advisors for Stockholders
and incur such other expenses on behalf of the Stockholders in connection

Representative may deem appropriate in respect of the following:

(e) any claims (including settlement thereof) made by any Parent Indemnified
Person for indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE XII_ ; and

(f) any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement; provided
that no amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement (including
any schedules or exhibits, including the Allocation Schedule and the Payout
Spreadsheet, attached hereto) shall be made by the Stockholders
Representative without the express prior written consent of the Key
Stockholders;

 



-77- 

    

(g) take such other action as the Stockholders Representative is authorized
to take under this Agreement;

(h) make all determinations required or permitted under this Agreement;

 

(i) represent the Stockholders in all litigation and negotiate or enter into
settlements and compromises relating to any disputes arising in connection
with this Agreement; and

(j) take all relevant action in all such other matters as the Stockholders
Representative may deem necessary or appropriate to consummate the
Transactions.

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders Representative shall
have no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders, except as expressly
provided herein, and in the Stockholders Representative Engagement Agreement,
and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Stockholders Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or
the Company Disclosure Letter.

Section 13.02  _Stockholder_ _s_ __ _Representative Retention Account_. Upon
the Closing, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 13.01(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.03(c)(ii)_, Parent will pay to the Stockholders Representative, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the Representative Amount (and the
account in which it is held, the "Stockholders Representative Retention
Account"), which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the Stockholders Representative for, any Losses or other third-
party expenses pursuant to the Transaction Agreements and any agreements
ancillary thereto, including, the Stockholders Representative Engagement
Agreement. The Stockholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Representative Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholders
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Stockholders Representative will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Stockholders Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Representative Amount, and has no tax
reporting or income distribution obligations. The Stockholders Representative
is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and
shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of
the Representative Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Stockholders
Representative may contribute funds to the Representative Amount from any
consideration otherwise distributable to the Stockholders. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Stockholders Representatives
responsibilities, the Stockholders Representative will deliver the remaining
balance of the Representative Amount to the Escrow and Payments Agent for
further distribution to the Stockholders.

Section 13.03 _Indemnification of Stockholders_ __ _Representative_. Certain
Stockholders have entered into an engagement agreement (the "Stockholders
Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Stockholders Representative
to provide direction to the Stockholders Representative in connection with
its services under this Agreement, the Escrow and Payments Agreements and the
Stockholders Representative Engagement Agreement (such
Stockholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the Stockholders
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
"Stockholders Representative Group") will incur any liability of any kind
with respect to any action or omission by the Stockholders Representative in
connection with the Stockholders Representatives services pursuant to this
Agreement, the Stockholders Representative Engagement Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, except in the event of
Liability directly resulting from the

 Stockholders Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders Representative Group shall not be liable to the Stockholders for
any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Stockholders
will, severally as determined in accordance with the Allocation Schedule (and
not jointly), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholders
Representative Group from and against any and all losses, Liabilities, and
costs arising out of or in connection with the Stockholders Representatives
execution and performance of the Stockholders Representative Engagement
Agreement, this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements or ancillary
agreements thereto to which it is a party, in each case as such loss,
Liability or cost is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the event that
any such loss, Liability or cost is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the
Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders Representative will reimburse
the Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Loss to the
extent attributable to such fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholders Representative by the
Stockholders, any such Losses may be recovered by the Stockholders
Representative from (1) the funds in the Stockholders Representative
Retention Account and (2) the Escrow Amount at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Stockholders; _provided_ that, while
this  _Section_ __ _ 13.03_ allows the Stockholders Representative to be
paid from the Representative Amount and the Escrow Amount, this does not
relieve the Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
losses, Liabilities and costs as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stockholders Representative from seeking any remedies available
to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders Representative
be required to advance its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability on behalf of the Stockholders or otherwise. Furthermore, the
Stockholders Representative shall not be required to take any action unless
the Stockholders Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its reasonable determination, are sufficient to protect
the Stockholders Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Stockholders Representative in performing such
actions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on indemnity or, solely with respect to the
Stockholders, non-recourse provisions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement
are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the
Stockholders Representative in this _Section_ __ _ 13.03_. The Stockholders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities and immunities will
survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholders Representative and the
Closing and/or the termination of this Agreement and the Escrow and Payments
Agreements.

 

Section 13.04 _Reliance_. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to (a) rely upon the Payout
Spreadsheet and any document or instrument reasonably believed to be genuine,
accurate as to content and signed by any Stockholder or any Party hereunder
and (b) assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance
with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a
decision of the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
the Stockholders and their respective successors, and all defenses which may
be available to any Stockholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of
the Stockholders Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or
the Stockholders Representative engagement agreement are waived.

Section 14.04 _Public Announcements_. From the Execution Date until the
Closing, no Party nor the Stockholders Representative nor any Affiliate or
Representative of the foregoing shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement in respect of the Transaction
Agreements or the Transactions without the prior approval of Parent (in the
case of any Company Party and its Affiliates and Representatives) or the
Company (in the case of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives) (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not prohibit such disclosure if required by Law, any
Governmental Authority or any recognized stock exchange on which the equity
interests of a Party or any of its respective Affiliates are listed so long as
the applicable disclosing Party consults with Parent (in the case of any
Company Party and its Affiliates and Representatives) or the Company (in
the case of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives) in advance of such disclosure and provides
such other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on a draft of such
disclosure to the extent practicable. From and after the Closing, neither the
Stockholders Representative nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement in respect of the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions
without the prior approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 14.05 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
Law or as a matter of public policy, the validity, legality and enforceability
of all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be
affected or impaired. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority declares that any term
or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties agree
that the court making such determination will have the power to reduce the
scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 14.06 _Assignment_ _; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (other than by operation of Law) without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may assign this Agreement in whole or in part, without
consent, by written notice to the Company, to one or more wholly owned direct
or indirect Subsidiaries of Parent in lieu of Parent, Merger Sub I and/or
Merger Sub II, in which event all references herein to Parent, Merger Sub I
and/or Merger Sub II, as applicable, shall be deemed references to such other
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries, except that all representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Parent, Merger Sub I and/or Merger Sub II as of
the Execution Date shall be deemed representations and warranties made with
respect to such other Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as of the date of such
assignment; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any such assignment shall not (a)
impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise impede the
rights of the Stockholders under this Agreement or (b) relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall
be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of such parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance
herewith without notice or Liability to any other Person. In some instances,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely

 



-84- 

    

 upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the Execution Date or
as of any other date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and for
the avoidance of doubt, _ARTICLE XII_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified
Persons and _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ is intended to benefit the DandO Indemnified
Persons.

 

Section 14.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and the other Transaction
Agreements (and all exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto) collectively
constitute and contain the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties
and the Stockholders Representative with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior negotiations,
correspondence, understandings, agreements and contracts, whether written or
oral, among the Parties and the Stockholders Representative respecting the
subject matter hereof and thereof. 

Section 14.08 _Tax Advice_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that it
has not received and is not relying upon Tax advice from any other party
hereto, and that it has and will continue to consult its own advisors with
respect to Taxes.

 

Section 14.09 _Amendments_. The Transaction Agreements (including all exhibits
and schedules thereto) may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, and any provision thereof may be waived, only by written agreement
making specific reference to the applicable Transaction Agreement to be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or provision to
be waived, in each case duly executed by each party to such Transaction
Agreement.

Section 14.10 _Waiver_. At any time before the Closing, either the Company or
Parent may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
acts of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II (in the case of the Company) or
a Company Party (in the case of Parent), (b) waive any breaches or
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub I or
Merger Sub II (in the case of the Company) or a Company Party (in the case of
Parent) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any covenant, agreement or
condition contained in this Agreement, but such waiver of compliance with any
such covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No failure on the
part of any Party or the Stockholders Representative to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy under any Transaction
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party or the Stockholders
Representative preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or remedy.

 

Section 14.11 _Governing Law_. THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, AND ANY ACTION THAT
MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE OR BE INCIDENTAL TO ANY
TRANSACTION, ANY TRANSACTION AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION,
PERFORMANCE OR CONSUMMATION THEREOF OR THE INDUCEMENT OF ANY PARTY OR THE
STOCKHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE TO ENTER THEREIN, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING (EACH, A "TRANSACTION DISPUTE"), WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY LAW THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED, EXCEPT INSOFAR AS
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK ARE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER AND
THE SUBSEQUENT MERGER. THE COMPANY WILL CAUSE THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS, AND PARENT WILL CAUSE THE PARENT INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, TO COMPLY WITH
THE FOREGOING AS THOUGH SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSONS WERE A PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



-85- 

    

Section 14.12 _Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Any Transaction Dispute will exclusively be brought and resolved in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware or, in the event that such court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Transaction Dispute, any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. In that context, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party and the
Stockholders Representative irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts with respect to any Transaction Dispute and for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, and agrees that all claims in
respect of any Transaction Dispute shall be heard and determined in such
courts;

(ii) agrees that venue would be proper in such courts, and waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have that any such court is an
improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of any Transaction Dispute;
and

(iii) agrees that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the Persons listed in _Section_ __ _ 14.03_ of any process
required by any such court, will be effective service of process; _provided_
,  _however_ , that nothing herein will be deemed to prevent a Party or the
Stockholders Representative from making service of process by any means
authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) The foregoing consent to jurisdiction will not constitute submission to
jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in the State of
Delaware for any purpose except with respect to any Transaction Dispute.

Section 14.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
EACH PARTY AND THE STOCKHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY TRANSACTION DISPUTE AND COVENANTS THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF
ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES WILL ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO SUCH TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY
REPRESENTATIVE CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) SUCH PERSON HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (B) SUCH PERSON MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (C) SUCH WAIVER CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH
SUCH PERSON IS RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THE TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS. EACH PARTY REPRESENTATIVE MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A
COPY OF THIS _SECTION 14.13_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
CONSENT OF EACH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 14.14 _Admissibility into Evidence_. All offers of compromise or
settlement among the Parties and the Stockholders Representative or their
respective Representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any
Transaction Dispute (a) shall be deemed to have been delivered in furtherance
of a Transaction Dispute settlement, (b) shall be exempt from discovery and
production and (c) shall not be admissible into evidence (whether as an
admission or otherwise) in any Action for the resolution of the Transaction
Dispute.

 



-86- 

    

Section 14.15 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise set forth in this Agreement (including in
_Section_ __ _ 12.05_), all remedies under this Agreement expressly
conferred upon a Party or the Stockholders Representative will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such Person, and the exercise by a Party or
the Stockholders Representative of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

(b) Each Party and the Stockholders Representative agree that irreparable
damage would occur and the Parties and the Stockholders Representative would
not have an adequate remedy at Law if any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each Party and the Stockholders Representative agree that the
other Parties and/or the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be,
will be entitled to injunctive relief from time to time to prevent breaches
of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement without the requirement of posting any bond or
other indemnity, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled,
at Law or in equity, and each Party and the Stockholders Representative agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement, and
to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such Person under this Agreement. Each of Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company Parties, on the other hand, expressly disclaims that it
is owed any duties from the other not expressly set forth in this Agreement,
and waives and releases all tort claims and tort causes of action (other than
claims or causes of action for Fraud) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement.

 

Section 14.16 _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, Liabilities or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to the Transaction Agreements,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of the Transaction Agreements
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to, the Transaction Agreements), may be made only against (and
are expressly limited to) the entities that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements,
as applicable ("Contracting Parties"). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any
Contracting Party, or any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing ("Nonparty
Affiliates"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to the Transaction Agreements, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of the Transaction Agreements (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, the Transaction
Agreements); and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims, causes of
action and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates; _provided_ that
this _Section_ __ _ 14.16_ shall not apply to _ARTICLE XIII_ , which shall be
enforceable by the Stockholders Representative in its entirety against the
Stockholders.

Section 14.17 _Counterparts_. Each Transaction Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimiles,
e-mail transmission of .pdf signatures or other electronic copies of
signatures complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, _e.g._ ,
www.docusign.com, shall be deemed to be originals and to have been duly and
validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

 



-87- 

    

Section 14.18 _Confidential Supervisory Information_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty
shall be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would
involve the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including
confidential supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and
as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Authority by any
Party to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable Law. To the
extent legally permissible, appropriate substitute disclosures or actions
shall be made or taken under circumstances in which the limitations of the
preceding sentence apply.
