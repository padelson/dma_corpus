the Surviving Company shall be authorized to  



 

7  execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or

ARTICLE II

Section 2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders
of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub: 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(d), 2.1(e)
and 2.3, each issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be cancelled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and
to the extent provided in, Section 2.1(e)) of Applera Corporation  Applied
Biosystems Group Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ " or " _Shares_ "), which prior to the Effective Time and by virtue of
the Celera Separation will be the only class of common stock of the Company
then outstanding, shall thereupon be converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the following consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "):

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been
effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each, a "
_Mixed Consideration Electing Share_ ") and each Non-Electing Company Share
(as that term is defined in Section 2.2(c) of this Agreement) shall be
converted into the right to receive the combination (which combination shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $17.10 in
cash (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 0.4543 of a share of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance
with Section 2.1(d) of this Agreement.

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each, a " _Cash Electing Company
Share_ ") shall be converted ( _provided_ _that_ the Available Cash Election
Amount (as defined below) equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount (as
defined below)) into the right to receive $38.00 in cash without interest (the
" _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ "); _except_ that if (A) the product
of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration (such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B)
the difference between (x) the product of the Per Share Cash Amount and the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled
Shares, as such term  



 

8  is defined in Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (y) the product of the
number of Mixed Consideration Electing Shares (including any Non-Electing
Company Shares) and the Per Share Cash Amount (such difference being the "
_Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each Cash Electing Company Share
shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash
Fraction.

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.2 (each, a " _Stock Electing Company
Share_ ") shall be converted ( _provided_ _that_ the Cash Election Amount
equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into the right to
receive 0.8261 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares
of Parent Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.1(d) (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(e), the "
_Stock Consideration_ "), _except_ that if the Available Cash Election Amount
exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Electing Company Share shall
be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Stock
Electing Company Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1) of
this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration. 

(iv) If the Twenty-Day VWAP is less than $46.00 per share of Parent Common
Stock, the holder of each share of Company Common Stock which is converted
pursuant to Section 2.1 into a right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock shall, in addition,
receive an amount in cash without interest equal to the product of (x) the
portion of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder has a right to
receive multiplied by (y) the lesser of (A) $46.00 _minus_ the Twenty-Day VWAP
and (B) $2.31.

(v) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

" _Twenty-Day VWAP_ " means the arithmetic average of the Weighted Average
Price of the Parent Common Stock on each trading day during the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third (3rd) Business Day
prior to the Effective Time.



 

9 " _Principal Market_ " means the Nasdaq National Market, or if the
Common Stock is not traded on the Nasdaq National Market, then the principal
securities exchange or trading market for the Common Stock.

" _Weighted Average Price_ " means, for any security as of any date, the
dollar volume-weighted average price for such security on the Principal Market
during the period beginning at 9:30 a.m., New York City Time, and ending
at 4:00 p.m., New York City Time, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets,
or any successor thereto (" _Bloomberg_ "), through its "Volume at Price"
functions or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-
weighted average price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the
electronic bulletin board for such security during the period beginning at
9:30 a.m., New York City time, and ending at 4:00 p.m., New York City Time, as
reported by Bloomberg. If the Weighted Average Price cannot be calculated for
such security on such date on any of the foregoing bases, the Weighted Average
Price of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Company. All such determinations to be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split or other similar
transaction during such period.

(b) _Company, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and held by the Company or any of the Companys
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, and each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Interests_. Each issued and outstanding limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly
issued limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company.

(d)  _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Section 2.1(d) shall be deemed to permit any
action that Parent or the Company is otherwise prohibited from taking
pursuant to this Agreement or to effect any such adjustment as a result of the
Celera Separation.

(e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the  



 

10  provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ _ _ _262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, but instead such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to be Mixed Consideration Electing Shares that have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Mixed
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i) of this Agreement. The Company
shall serve prompt written notice (but in any event within 48 hours) to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and any
withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.2 _Company Election Procedures_.

(a) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 3.12), Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
which Exchange Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the
purpose of exchanging certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Company Book-
Entry Shares_ ").

(b) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date (as defined below), is
a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock other than Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to specify the number of such holders shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election,
a Stock Election or a Mixed Election.

(c) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Form S-4 (as defined in
Section 3.12) a form of election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and
any Certificates. The Company shall mail the Form of Election with the Joint
Proxy Statement to all persons who are record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting (as
defined in Section 5.5(b)). The Form of Election shall be used by each record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record  



 

11  holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation)
to make a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election. In the event
that a holder fails to make a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed
Election with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock held or
beneficially owned by such holder, then such holder shall be deemed to have
made a Mixed Election with respect to those shares (each such share, a "
_Non-Electing Company Share_ "). The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all persons who
become record holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period
between the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Election
Date.

(d) Any holders election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on (1) the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (2) if the
Closing Date is more than four Business Days following the Company
Stockholders Meeting, two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Election Date_ "), a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by (i) Certificates representing the shares of Company Common
Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or
otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or by
an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in
such Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution"
(as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "));  _provided_ _that_ such Certificates are
in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such
guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, any
additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election. After a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election is
validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, no further
registration of transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock transfer
books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election, Stock Election or
Mixed Election is properly revoked.

(e) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Date at least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the
Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall
promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Date.

(f) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with
respect to all or a portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the Election Date. In addition, all Cash Elections, Stock Elections and
Mixed Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Article VII of this Agreement. If a Cash Election or Stock
Election is revoked, the shares as to which such election previously applied
shall be treated as Mixed Consideration Electing Shares in accordance with
Section 2.1(a)(i) unless a contrary election is submitted by the holder
within the period during which elections are permitted to be made pursuant to
Section 2.2(d). Certificates will not be returned to holders, and the accounts
of holders of Company Book-Entry Shares will not be credited at the
Depository Trust Company, unless the holder so requests.



 

12 (g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of
Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make
any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not
Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this Section 2.2 and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections
and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or
Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines
to make the following computation) shall also make all computations
contemplated by Section 2.1(a), and absent manifest error this computation
shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written
agreement of Parent (subject to the consent of the Company, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any rules as are
consistent with this Section 2.2 for the implementation of the Cash Elections,
Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or
desirable to effect these Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the equity
holders of the Company entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement, (i) certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares
in book-entry form, representing shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent
Certificates_ ") in denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify
and (ii) cash, in each case, as is issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant
to this Article II in respect of shares of Company Common Stock for which
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the
Exchange Agent or the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Such
Parent Certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case may be) and
such cash so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares whose shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, if applicable,
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. (x) Each former stockholder of the Company who properly
made and did not revoke a Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such stockholders Cash Electing
Company Shares, Stock Electing Company Shares or Mixed Consideration Electing
Shares, as the case may be; and (y) each holder of Non-Electing Company
Shares, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Company Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, representing such Non-Electing Company Shares
together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be able to exchange
therefor, the following:

(i) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
holders shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were
converted in accordance with this Article II (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock to which an election or non-election were
made), and such Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
be forthwith cancelled, and



 

13 (ii) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any
required withholdings pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)) equal to (I) the
amount of cash (including the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and cash
in lieu of fractional interests in shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.3(e)), if any, into which such holders shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in
accordance with this Article II, plus (II) any cash dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.3(c). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent
Certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
or Company Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if such
Certificate (if applicable) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any
transfer or other non-income Taxes (as defined in Section 3.15(l)) required
by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to withhold or deduct under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II and cash,
if any, in lieu of any fractional share in accordance with Section 2.3(e). No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this Article
II. 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time, or that are payable to the holders of record thereof
who become  



 

14  such on or after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share until such Certificate
or Company Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Article II.
All such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock which are to be paid in respect of the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received upon surrender of the Certificate or Company
Book-Entry Shares shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws and Laws with
respect to the withholding of Taxes, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares there shall be paid to the holder of
the Parent Certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash for the
purpose of satisfying its obligations under clause (i) above.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The transfer of
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for the applicable
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including distributions and dividends paid pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and any
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(e)) shall
be deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Companys
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as
otherwise provided by Law.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

(i) No Parent Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Company Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall
relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent.



 

15 (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall pay to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of each holder of
Company Common Stock, an amount in cash, if any, equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective
Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price for
a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market
(as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , or, if not reported thereby, any
other authoritative source) on the day of the Effective Time. To the extent
that the Exchange Agent shall sell shares of Parent Common Stock included in
the Exchange Fund in order to satisfy Parents obligation to pay cash in lieu
of fractional shares, Parent shall pay any commissions, transfer Taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs in connection with such sale, if any.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Company Book-
Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

(g) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Company of the Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Section 2.3, except as otherwise provided by Section 2.1(e).

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration, any cash
payable to the holder of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this Article II or any dividends or distributions payable to the
holder of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration or cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, and any holders
of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock.



 

16 (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and,
if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in accordance with
this Article II in respect thereof.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Grants_.

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding unexpired and
unexercised option to purchase or acquire a share of Company Common Stock
under the Company Equity Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall
vest and become fully exercisable, whether or not then vested or subject to
any performance condition that has not been satisfied. At the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option shall be converted into an option to purchase the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Stock
Option Conversion Fraction (as defined in this Section 2.4(a)) multiplied by
(y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock which could have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time upon the exercise of each such
Company Stock Option (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise
price per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the exercise price
for each such share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Stock Option
divided by the Stock Option Conversion Fraction, and all references to the
Company in each such option shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where
appropriate. The other terms of such Company Stock Options shall continue to
apply in accordance with their terms, including pursuant to such preexisting
terms and conditions, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall treat each
Company Stock Option as fully vested and exercisable. Each Company Stock
Option converted pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.4(a) shall be
referred to as a " _Parent Exchange Option_." In connection with the issuance
of Parent Exchange Options, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that will become subject to Parent Exchange
Options pursuant to this Section 2.4(a). As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to each holder of an
outstanding Parent Exchange Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption by Parent. Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate form that Parent is eligible to use)
under the Securities Act on the Closing Date with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Exchange Options and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to remain
effective until the exercise or expiration of the Parent Exchange Options.
For purposes of this Section 2.4(a), the " _Stock Option Conversion Fraction_
" shall mean the Exchange Ratio subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.1(d).

The number of shares subject to any Parent Exchange Option and the exercise
price per share of such Parent Exchange Option shall be determined in
a manner which would not result in the conversion of Company Stock Options
into Parent Exchange Options being treated as a new grant of stock options
under Section 409A of the Code, and the Company and Parent shall agree upon
any adjustments to this Section 2.4(a) necessary to avoid such new grant of
stock options.



 

17 (b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary, subject to applicable Law, pursuant to the terms of the Applera
Corporation 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, and any other
applicable employee stock purchase plan (collectively, including sub-plans
adopted under such plan for the benefit of employees outside the U.S, the "
_ESPPs_ ") in order to (i) ensure that no offering periods under the ESPPs
commence after the date hereof, (ii) if necessary, shorten the offering period
under the ESPPs in effect at the Effective Time (the " _Current Offering_ "),
such that the Current Offering shall terminate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) if (ii) above is necessary, permit participants in the
ESPPs to exercise, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
any purchase rights existing immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
ESPPs to acquire shares of Company Common Stock at the purchase price set
forth in the ESPPs, and (iv) refund to participants in the ESPPs the funds
that remain in the participants accounts after any such purchase. The Company
shall take any and all actions (but subject to compliance with the terms and
conditions of awards and applicable Law in jurisdictions outside the United
States) as may be necessary to terminate the ESPPs as of the Effective Time.

(c) _Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company 1999 Plan or otherwise that is
subject to restrictions (each, a share of " _Restricted Stock_ ") which have
not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and treated as Mixed Consideration Electing Shares pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i).

(d) _Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding right
to receive Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock unit award granted under
any Company Equity Plan that is subject to restrictions (each, a "
_Restricted Stock Unit Award_ ") which have not lapsed immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become fully vested. As of the Effective Time, each
such Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be settled in shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of such Restricted Stock Unit Award, all of
which Shares shall be treated as Mixed Consideration Electing Shares pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)(i).

(e) _Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
right to receive shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a stock unit
award or deferred stock award under any Company Equity Plan or the Applera
Corporation Director Stock Purchase and Deferred Compensation Plan (each, a "
_Stock_ _Unit Award_ ") that is held by a director who will not become
a director of Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.17 shall
be fully vested and settled in shares of Company Common Stock, but treated in
any case in accordance with the terms of such Stock Unit Award and such
directors election form. All such shares of Company Common Stock issued
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be treated as Stock
Electing Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). As of the Effective
Time, each outstanding Stock Unit Award that is held by a director who will
become a director of Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.17
shall be assumed by Parent. Subject  



 

18  to, and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan
or the Applera Corporation Director Stock Purchase and Deferred Compensation
Plan and any applicable award certificate or other agreement, each Stock Unit
Award referenced in the immediately preceding sentence shall be converted into
the right to receive the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (or an amount
in respect thereof for cash-settled Stock Unit Awards) equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Stock Unit Award, multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(d)
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock).
Each such Stock Unit Award shall have the same terms and conditions as were in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2008, by and between the Company and Celera Corporation (the " _Separation
Agreement_ ")), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

Section 3.1  _Qualification, Organization, Etc_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power
and authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
this Section 3.1) on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse_  



 

19   _Effect_ " on or with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
means any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development
or circumstance (any such item, an " _Effect_ ") that (A) is or would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on or change in
the financial condition, properties, business, results of operations, or net
assets of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
Parent and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) would reasonably
be expected to result in criminal sanctions or prohibit or materially restrict
or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following shall constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether
there has been, or will be, a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to
the Company or the Parent, as the case may be: any Effect caused by or
resulting from (i) general changes or developments in the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries operate, as
applicable, (ii) political instability, acts of terrorism or war, (iii) any
change affecting the United States economy generally or the economy of any
region in which such party or any of its Subsidiaries conducts business that
is material to the business of such party and its Subsidiaries, (iv) any
change in the Companys stock price or trading volume or Parents stock price
or trading volume (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving
rise to or contributing to such change in stock price or trading volume may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, or will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (v) any failure, in and of
itself, by the Company or Parent to meet any internal or published
projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any period
ending on or after the date of this Agreement (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, or will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (vi) the announcement of the
execution of this Agreement, or the pendency of the consummation of the
Merger, including any termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact
on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent due to the
announcement and performance of this Agreement or the identity of Parent, in
the case of the Company, or the identity of the Company, in the case
of Parent, or the performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including compliance with the covenants set forth herein,
(vii) any change in any applicable Law, rule or regulation or GAAP (as defined
in Section 3.4(b)) or interpretation thereof after the date hereof, (viii)
the execution and performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including
any action taken with the consent of the other party, or (ix) any claim,
action, suit or proceeding alleging breach of fiduciary duty or other
violation of applicable Law relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless, in the case of clause (i), (ii), (iii)
or (vii) above, such Effect has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
materially disproportionate adverse impact on the financial condition,
properties, business, results of operations net assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other affected persons. For purposes of the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, if an Effect has a materially disproportionate
adverse impact on the financial condition, properties, business, results of
operations or net assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other
affected persons, then for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred, (i) only the extent to which such Effect has
disproportionately affected such party shall be taken into account and (ii)
the determination of whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred shall
be based on (x) the incremental impact of such Effect on such party relative
to  



 

20  other persons and (y) whether such incremental impact itself constitutes a
Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Companys certificate
of incorporation and by-laws which have been delivered to Parent are complete

Company is not in violation of any provision of its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws.

incorporation or organization, has the power and authority to own its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and, if applicable, is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions
in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Company (including, for this purpose only, the entity listed in Section 3.6
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, but only as to the proportionate share of
any liability or obligation of such entity that is allocable to the Company),

the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation or

Section 5.2 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement intend that the Merger will qualify as a

Parent shall, nor shall they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to,
take or cause to be taken any action (including agreeing to any transaction or
entering into any agreement), except with respect to the Celera Separation,
that would result in the Merger failing to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use all commercially reasonable efforts, to cause
the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including providing the representations, covenants and
certificates referred to in Sections 5.5(d)(iii) and 6.1(g) of this Agreement.

67  Date, to its and its Subsidiaries properties, contracts, commitments, books

shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to furnish promptly to one another such additional financial
and operating data and other information as to its and its Subsidiaries
respective businesses and properties as the other or its Representatives may
from time to time reasonably request (including furnishing to the other party
such granting partys financial results in advance of filing any SEC
Documents containing such financial results), except that nothing herein shall
require either the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to disclose any information to the other that would cause a violation of any
agreement to which the disclosing party is a party, would cause a risk of a
loss of privilege to the party disclosing such data or information, or would
constitute a violation of applicable Laws. The parties hereby agree that
each of them will treat any such information in accordance with the Amended
and Restated Joint Non-Disclosure Agreement between the Company and Parent,
dated as of April 10, 2008, and the Joint Defense, Common Interest and
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of May 9,

officers, employees or agents of the Company or Parent, as applicable, to
report material operational matters and the general status of their
respective ongoing operations. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, no party shall be obligated to make any disclosure in
violation of applicable Laws or regulations. Prior to the Effective Time, at a
date and time mutually acceptable to the parties, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for a meeting among Parent, the
Company and the parties identified in Section 5.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, it being understood that representatives of the Company shall
participate in such meeting, and in no event shall Parent or its
representatives contact such parties without the Company or its
representatives present.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a)  _No Solicitation_. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, nor authorize or permit any of its officers, directors
or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly, or indirectly, (i) solicit or encourage (including by way of
furnishing any information to any person) any inquiries with respect to, or
the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4(f)(ii)), (ii) engage in any negotiations
concerning or furnish to any person any information with respect to any
possible Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the existence
of the provisions of this Section 5.4), (iii) withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify, the Company Board Recommendation (as defined in
Section 5.5(c)) in a manner adverse to Parent (except to the extent
specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.4(d)), (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Transaction (as defined in Section 5.4(f)(ii)) (except to the extent

referred to in the foregoing clauses (iii) or (iv), whether taken by the
Companys Board of Directors or a committee thereof, an " _Adverse_   



 

68   _Recommendation Change_ ") , or (v) enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or similar document or any contract, agreement
or commitment (whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to
any Alternative Transaction Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement
that the Company is permitted to enter into under Section 5.4(c). Each of the
Company and Parent and each of their respective Subsidiaries will immediately
cease, and will cause its officers, directors and employees and instruct any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it to cease, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce (and will not waive, terminate or modify any
provisions of) any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar
agreement) relating to any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, including by
requesting the other party thereto to promptly return or destroy
any confidential information previously furnished thereto and using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain injunctions or other equitable
remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms thereof, except to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors) that enforcement of any such confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or similar agreement) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(b) _Notification of Alternative Transaction Proposals_. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after receipt of
any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or any inquiry relating in any way to any Alternative Transaction Proposal,
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall provide the other party with
oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the
person or group of persons making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided to it in
connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.
In addition, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall provide the
other party as promptly as possible with oral and written notice setting forth
all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep the other party
informed in all material respects of all oral or written communications
regarding, and the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed material amendments) of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request or inquiry, and, without limitation of the other provisions of this
Section 5.4, shall promptly provide to the other party a copy of all written
materials (including written materials provided by email or otherwise in
electronic format) subsequently provided by or to it in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.

(c) _Permitted Actions in Connection with Certain Alternative Transaction
Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
5.4(a), in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined (in accordance
with Section 5.4(f)(iii)) to be, or, in the good faith determination of the
Companys Board of Directors, is reasonably likely to become, a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4(f)(iii)), it may then take the following
actions (but only if and to the extent that (y) its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its  



 

69  financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
and (z) the Company has given Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take any of the following actions and of
the identity of the person or group of persons making such Alternative
Transaction Proposal and a summary of the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal and if it shall not have breached in any
material respect any of the provisions of this Section 5.4):

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the person or group of persons making
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, _provided_   _that_ (A) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information, the Company receives from such
person or group of persons an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms at least as restrictive with respect to such person or group of persons
as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement is with respect to
Parent and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such person or group of persons, it furnishes such nonpublic
information to the other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to such party); and

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or group of
persons with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

(d) _Change of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Companys Board of Directors may, if it concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ that
prior to any such Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company shall have
given Parent and Merger Sub prompt written notice advising them of (x) the
decision of the Companys Board of Directors to take such action and the
reasons therefor and (y) in the event the decision relates to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, a summary of the material terms and conditions of the
Alternative Transaction Proposal and other information requested to be
provided with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 5.4, including the
information required to be provided pursuant to Section 5.4(b) and (c), (B)
the Company shall have given Parent and Merger Sub three (3) Business Days
(the " _Notice Period_ ") after delivery of each such notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and,
during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall direct its financial
advisors and outside legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, if applicable, such
Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the
Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal advisors), a Superior Proposal or, if the Adverse
Recommendation Change does not involve an Alternative Transaction Proposal, to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Adverse Recommendation Change is otherwise not necessary, and (C) the
Companys Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent and Merger Sub, if any, that such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, if applicable, continues to constitute a Superior  



 

70  Proposal or that such Adverse Recommendation Change is otherwise still
required; _provided_ _further_ that, (1) if during the Notice
Period described in clause (B) of this paragraph any revisions are made to
the Superior Proposal, if applicable, and the Companys Board of Directors in
its good faith judgment determines (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal advisors) that such revisions are material (it
being understood that any change in the purchase price or form of
consideration in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision),
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply
with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d) with respect to such new written
notice except that the new Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days
instead of three (3) Business Days and (2) in the event the Companys Board
of Directors does not make the determination referred to in clause (C) of this
paragraph but thereafter determines to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.4(d), the procedures referred to in clauses (A),
(B) and (C) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent
withdrawal, amendment or change.

(e) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or Parent or their respective Boards of Directors
from taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
_that_ the Company shall not withdraw, modify or change the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, unless specifically permitted
pursuant to the terms of Section 5.4(d), and Parent shall not withdraw,
modify or change the Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the
Company.

(f) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " with respect to a party hereto, shall mean
any of the following transactions: (i) any transaction or series of related
transactions with one or more third persons involving: (A) any purchase from
such party or acquisition (whether by way of a merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, consolidation or similar transaction) by
any person or "group" of persons (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 25%
interest in the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any of
its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person or group of persons beneficially owning 25% or
more of the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving such party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any sale,
lease exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more than 25%
of the fair market value of the assets, net income, net revenues or cash flows
of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to
such transaction, (ii) any liquidation or dissolution of such party, or (iii)
any combination of the foregoing;



 

71 (ii) " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " shall mean any offer,
inquiry, proposal or indication of interest (whether binding or non-binding)
to any person or its stockholders relating to an Alternative Transaction; and

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited, bona fide written
Alternative Transaction Proposal made by a third person to acquire, directly
or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination or acquisition transaction, (A)
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or (B) over 50% of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company and as a result of which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction (or its ultimate parent), which the Companys Board
of Directors has in good faith determined (taking into account, among other
things, (1) its consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
advisors, and (2) all terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)
to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys
stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders), than the terms of this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and to be
reasonably capable in feasibility and certainty of being consummated on the
terms proposed, taking into account all legal, financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal (including conditions to consummation).

Section 5.5 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement,
and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments
from the SEC and have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Parents stockholders, and the Company will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection
with the issuance and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger and the conversion of the Company Stock Options into options to acquire
Parent Common Stock, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Parent without the Companys prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the Company the
opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company
promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when
the Form S-4 has  



 

72  become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly
provide the Company with copies of any written communication from the SEC or
any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information (including any termination, withdrawal, modification or
change of the Company Board Recommendation) relating to Parent or the Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, of Parent and
the Company.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational
Documents, in the case of the Company, and the Parent Organizational
Documents, in the case of Parent, to duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable to
consider, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance (the " _Parent
Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ") and, in the case of the Company, the adoption
and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders_
__ _Meeting_ "), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting to be held
on the same day. Subject to Section 5.4(d), each of the Company and Parent
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance, and, in the
case of the Company, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
Merger, and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders, as applicable, required by the rules of
the NYSE, the Nasdaq Global Select Market or applicable Laws to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company or Parent may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its respective stockholders in
advance of a vote on, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance and, in the
case of the Company, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger, or, if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting or
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Each of
the Company and Parent shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed, convened,
held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may
be, are solicited in  



 

73  compliance with applicable Laws, the rules of the NYSE or the Nasdaq Global
Select Market and, in the case of the Company, the Company
Organizational Documents, and, in the case of Parent, the Parent
Organizational Documents. Except with respect to matters as to which
preliminary proxy materials would not be required to be filed with the SEC,
without the prior written consent of the Company, the Stock Issuance, an
amendment to the Parents Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number
of authorized shares of Parent Common Stock and an amendment to the Parent
Option Plan to increase the number of shares available under such plan or the
adoption of a new plan are the only matters which Parent shall propose to be
acted on by Parents stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting;
_provided_ , that the approval of the Stock Issuance shall not be conditioned
on approval of any matter other than the increase in the number of authorized
shares of Parent Common Stock. Without the prior written consent of Parent,
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger are the only matters
which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders
at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(c) Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.4(d): (i) the Board
of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and, in the case of Parent, the Stock Issuance at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement
to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A) Parent has recommended that
Parents stockholders vote in favor of the Stock Issuance, the increase in the
number of authorized shares of Parent Common Stock and the amendment to the
Parent Option Plan to increase the number of shares available under such plan
or the adoption of a new plan (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ") and (B)
the Company has recommended that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (iii)
neither the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of
its respective Board of Directors that the respective stockholders of the
Company or Parent vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and, in the case of Parent, the
Stock Issuance.

(d) The Company and Parent shall together (unless any action is specifically
identified as the obligation of only one of the parties hereto) or pursuant to
an allocation of responsibility to be agreed upon between them:

(i) Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the Nasdaq Global Select
Market and such other stock exchanges as shall be agreed upon listing
applications covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger
and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon the
exercise, vesting, or payment under any Parent Exchange Option and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time,
approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject only to official
notice of issuance;



 

74 (ii) cooperate with each other in order to lift any injunctions or remove any
other impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein;
and

(iii) cooperate with each other in obtaining a written opinion of its
respective legal counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, in the
case of the Company, and DLA Piper US LLP, in the case of Parent (" _Tax
Counsel_ "), in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent,
respectively (each such opinion, a " _Tax Opinion_ "), dated as of the
Effective Time, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Parent and
the Company each will be treated as a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cooperate with each Tax Counsel and shall deliver to each
Tax Counsel for purposes of each Tax Opinion customary representations and
covenants, including those contained in certificates of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and others, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to each
Tax Counsel.

(e) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.3, the Company and
Parent shall each furnish the other and to its counsel all such information as
may be required in order to effect the foregoing actions, and each represents
and warrants to the other that no information furnished by it in connection
with such actions, or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
order to make any information so furnished, in light of the circumstances
under which it is so furnished, not misleading.

Section 5.6 _Affiliate Agreements_. The Company shall, prior to the Effective
Time, deliver to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for
Parent), setting forth the names and addresses of all persons who are, at the
time of the Company Meeting, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
The Company shall furnish such information and documents as Parent may
reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such list. The Company shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person who is identified
as an "affiliate" in the list furnished pursuant to this Section 5.6 to
execute a written agreement on or prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement, in the form of Exhibit A hereto.

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time. Subject to statutory or other legal
requirements and information and consultation obligations, for a period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2009, Parent
shall provide to current and former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company_ _Employees_ ") (i) a base salary or hourly wage
rate and commission, bonus and non-equity based  



 

75  incentives that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) welfare and employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements (it
being understood that discretionary equity and equity based awards will remain
discretionary) that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time; it being
understood that, subject to Section 5.7(c) of this Agreement, nothing
contained herein shall preclude Parent from changing or terminating any
existing plan, program or arrangement pursuant to its terms, so long as
Parent complies with the provisions of this sentence. From and after January
1, 2010, Company Employees will receive compensation and benefits pursuant to
the welfare, compensation and employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of Parent provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(b) In the event Parent makes New Plans available to Company Employees, then
(A) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under pension or similar plans) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ _that_ the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits or for newly
established plans and programs for which prior service of Parent employees is
not taken into account; and (B) to the extent permissible by applicable law
and the applicable plans, in addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company employee
benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_
"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee,
Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Parent shall honor the Applera Corporation Corporate CIC Severance Policy,
substantially on the terms set forth on Section 5.7(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Severance_ _Pay_ _P_ _lan_ ), each of which shall
be applicable in the event of a participants qualifying termination (as
described in the CIC Plan) of employment following the Closing, all upon the
terms set forth therein except that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the CIC Plan, (i) the obligation to pay severance set forth
therein shall not be discretionary on the part of the Company or Parent in
the event the applicable employees termination is a  



 

76  qualifying termination (i.e., one that results in the employee being
eligible for severance under the terms of the CIC Plan); and (ii) the Merger
shall constitute a "Change of Control" for purposes of the CIC Plan. For a
period of two (2) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall not
amend, or cause to be amended, the CIC Plan or otherwise take any action to
reduce the benefits payable thereunder. The CIC Plan shall be administered by
the directors of Parent who were directors of the Company prior to the
Effective Time and who become directors of Parent at the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 5.17, or if, at the time of any such determination, there
are no former directors of the Company on the Parent Board of Directors, the
Compensation Committee of the Parent Board of Directors (the " _Continuing
Company Directors_ "). The Continuing Company Directors shall have
discretionary authority with respect to the interpretation and application of
the CIC Plan and all determinations regarding whether a particular Company
Employee is entitled to receive payments under the CIC Plan shall be made by
the Continuing Company Directors, it being understood that in making such
determinations the Continuing Company Directors shall act in furtherance of
the purpose and intent of the CIC Plan, which is to provide compensation to
former Company Employees upon a qualifying termination of employment. The
decision of the Continuing Company Directors upon all matters within the scope
of their authority shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. The
Continuing Company Directors shall be indemnified for all good faith actions
taken in connection with the CIC Plan, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. Neither the Company nor Parent shall have any obligation to
make payments pursuant to the CIC Plan in the event this Agreement is
terminated or abandoned.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may implement a retention program
(the " _Retention Program_ ") for the purpose of retaining the services of
key Company Employees, on the terms and to the individuals as determined by,
and at the sole discretion of, the Companys executive officers in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the amount set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of such Retention Program, the
retention period shall run through a date that is three (3) months following
the Closing Date or such individual employees earlier scheduled termination
date. Any payments made under the Retention Program shall be made on the
earlier of thirty (30) days after the individual employees termination date
or three (3) months after the Closing Date, or such time period as required
by law, including Section 409A of the Code. The Company shall inform Parent of
the key features of the Retention Program, including the key Company Employees
covered by the Retention Program, and the anticipated amounts and timing of
such retention payments. The Retention Program shall be developed and
implemented by the executive officers of the Company in accordance with
Section 5.7(f) of this Agreement.

(e) Following the date hereof, in the event that after implementation of the
Retention Program described in Section 5.7(d) the Companys executive
officers reasonably determine that additional retention awards are necessary,
the Company may grant additional retention awards ("Supplemental _Retention_
_Awards_ " and, collectively with awards under the Retention Program,
"Retention Awards") for the purpose of retaining the services of key Company
Employees. Such Retention Awards shall be granted on such terms, and to such
persons, as shall be reasonably determined by the Companys executive
officers. Prior to  



 

77  granting any Retention Award, the Company shall consult with Parent and
consider Parents reasonable suggestions with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless Parent can provide the Companys
executive officers with a compelling business reason why any Retention Award
should not be granted, the Company shall have sole discretion to grant such
Retention Award. The Supplemental Retention Awards shall be developed and
implemented by the executive officers of the Company in accordance with the
following provisions: The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that any
Supplemental Retention Awards granted pursuant to this Sections 5.7(e) shall
be subject to the following: (i) such Supplemental Retention Awards shall
limit, to the greatest extent possible, the payments to be made to the
applicable Company Employee so that such payments constitute the
minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose and intent of
such Supplemental Retention Awards as to such employee; (ii) Supplemental
Retention Awards shall be granted, as and to the extent reasonably necessary,
in a manner that provides incentives to critical Company personnel to remain
in the employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) Supplemental
Retention Awards shall be targeted to Company Employees performing functions
that are reasonably determined to be critical to the operational success and
performance of the Company, acknowledging for this purpose all reasonably
applicable factors, including (A) the significance of the applicable Company
Employees job function, (B) the relative ease or difficulty of finding a
suitable replacement for such Company Employee; (C) the perceived disruption
or other impact to the functioning of the Companys businesses as a result of
the possible loss of such employee; and (D) such other factors as are
reasonably taken into account by the executive officers of the Company in
determining which Company Employees should received Supplemental Retention
Awards.

(f) Parent shall honor in accordance with their terms, and, on and after the
Effective Time, shall make all payments pursuant to, without
offset, deduction, counterclaim, interruption, or deferment, (i) the
Companys Incentive Compensation Program for fiscal year 2008, consistent with
past practice, to the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Effective
Time; (ii) the Companys Incentive Compensation Program for fiscal year 2009,
consistent with past practice; _provided_ _that_ , in the case of clause (ii),
Parent shall make all required payments to each employee participant in such
program in an amount equal to the employees target incentive compensation
amount for fiscal year 2009, subject to the Companys Incentive Compensation
Payout formula, prorated based on the number of days during which such
employee participant was employed during fiscal year 2009; and (iii) the
Company Performance Unit Bonus Plan, to the extent not paid by the Company at
or prior to the Effective Time.

(g) In addition to the matters addressed in Section 5.7(c), Parent shall honor
all Individual Agreements and Company Plans providing for severance payments
to be made to Company Employees participating in such Individual Agreements
and Company Plans. After the Effective Time, all determinations regarding
whether a particular Company Employee is entitled to receive severance
payments or other benefits under any Individual Agreement or Company Plan
shall be made by the Continuing Company Directors. In no event shall a
Company Employee be entitled to severance benefits under more than one Company
Plan nor shall any Company Employee covered by an Individual Agreement
providing for severance benefits be entitled to severance benefits under a
Company Plan.



 

78 (h) Each of the Company and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that the
consummation of the Merger will constitute a " _Change in Control_ " or "
_Change of Control_ " (as such term is defined in the Company Plans and the
Company Individual Agreements) for all purposes under the Company Plans and
the Company Individual Agreements, including, without limitation, for
purposes of the Applera Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
effective as of December 31, 2005 (amended and restated as of August 28,
2006). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and Parent each hereby
acknowledge and agree that (i) at or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Rabbi Trust Payment Schedule_ ")
setting forth the payments to be made to the Company Employees pursuant to
the Company Plans and Company Individual Agreements to the extent such
payments are to be made from funds placed in the trust (the " _2002 Rabbi
Trust_ ") contemplated by that certain agreement captioned Trust under
Certain Applera Corporation Plans, dated September 1, 2002, between the
Company and The Northern Trust Company (the " _2002 Rabbi Trust Agreement_ ")
or the trust (the " _2007 Rabbi Trust_ " and, together with the 2002 Rabbi
Trust, the " _Rabbi Trusts_ ") contemplated by that certain agreement
captioned Trust under Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Specified
Contracts, dated August 15, 2007, between the Company and the Northern Trust
Company (the " _2007 Rabbi Trust Agreement_ " and, together with the 2002
Rabbi Trust Agreement, the " _Rabbi Trust Agreements_ "); (ii) at or prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall place additional funds in the Rabbi
Trusts such that sufficient funds are held by the Rabbi Trusts to pay all
amounts contemplated by the Rabbi Trust Payment Schedule; (iii) at or
immediately after the Effective Time Parent shall make all payments
to Company Employees from the funds placed in the Rabbi Trusts which are then
due and payable, as set forth on the Rabbi Trust Payment Schedule; (iv) Parent
shall from time to time make all other payments to Company Employees from the
funds placed in the Rabbi Trusts as such payments become due and payable, as
set forth on the Rabbi Trust Payment Schedule; and (v) Parent shall not seek
to withdraw funds from the Rabbi Trusts and shall not challenge any decision
of the Companys Board of Directors regarding the nature, amount or timing of
any funding of the Rabbi Trusts.

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (1)
the occurrence of any event known to it which would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, (A) have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(B) cause any condition set forth in Article VI to be unsatisfied in any
material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time; or (2) any action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened which questions or challenges the validity of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the party giving such
notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely by virtue of
having given such notice.

Section 5.9 _Filings; Other Action_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  



 

79  Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions,
clearances, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company
Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) defending all lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly (but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof) make their respective
filings under the HSR Act, (ii) on a timely basis make their respective

are operating any business and/or failure to file could result in

if any, as the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any other person,
may assert under a Regulatory Law (as defined in Section 5.9(f)) with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby subject to Section 5.9(f). In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to determine and agree upon, as soon as practicable after the

to which it may be necessary or appropriate, pursuant to Foreign Competition
Laws, to submit any filings, notifications or registrations or to take any
other actions in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that the foregoing shall not affect or otherwise modify the
condition to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
Section 6.1(f) of this Agreement.

the exchange of information, to review in advance, and to the extent
reasonably practicable consult the other on, all the information relating to

may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other

not participate in any meeting or oral communication with any Governmental

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger, and (vii) furnish

the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity. Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 5.9 as "outside counsel only." Such material
and the information contained therein shall be treated in accordance with the
Joint Defense, Common Interest and Confidentiality Agreement between Parent
and the Company, dated May 9, 2008 and will not be disclosed to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 5.9, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as defined
in Section 5.9(f) below), each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
all respects with each other and use all reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.9 shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or 7.1(d) so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this Section 5.9.



 

81 (e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of
the Company and Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to resolve any
such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity or private party may
have to such transactions under such Regulatory Law so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Without limiting this Section 5.9, Parent and the Company agree to take
any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no
later than the Outside Date (as defined in Section 7.1(b)(i))), including,
without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its Subsidiaries) or otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of
action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Company (or its
Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be required in order to obtain any
clearances or approvals required to consummate the Merger, or avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required or permitted to, nor
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent
of Parent, sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into any
license or similar agreement with respect to, restrict the ownership or
operation of, or agree to sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate,
enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to, restrict the
ownership or operation of, (A) any assets or businesses of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (B) any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in either case, to the extent that the sale, divestiture or
other disposition of such assets would be materially adverse to the business,
financial condition or the expected benefits of the Merger to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be
withheld in the Companys sole and absolute discretion). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
all Foreign Competition Laws, and all other federal, state or foreign, if any,
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or lessening competition, whether in the communications
industry or otherwise, through merger or acquisition.

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.



 

82 Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such

release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except

with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue
a press release announcing this Agreement.

arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees, as the case may be (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time. For a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Company shall (i) maintain in effect (A)
the current provisions regarding indemnification of and the advancement of
expenses to officers and directors contained in the Company Organizational
Documents (or comparable organizational documents) of each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (B) any indemnification agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers and employees
existing as on the date hereof, and (ii) jointly and severally indemnify the
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. For
purposes of the foregoing: (i) in the event any claim is asserted within the
six-year period during which Parent and the Surviving Company are required
to maintain the indemnification arrangements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all such rights in respect of any such claim shall continue
until disposition thereof; and (ii) any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the DGCL, the Company Organizational Documents (or the
organizational documents of the Surviving Company) or any such agreement, as
the case may be, for purposes of the allowance of indemnification or
advancement of expenses, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected
by such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Parent. For a period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies or purchase a
"tail policy," in either case, of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the
annual  



 

83  premium paid by the Company for such insurance for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 2008 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.12 it shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount.

(b) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs
and legal representatives.

(c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 5.12 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any other
applicable Laws.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other persons, or (B) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets to any
person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.12.

Section 5.13 _Accountants  "Comfort" Letters_. The Company and Parent will
each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to each
other letters from their respective independent accountants, one dated as of a
date within two (2) Business Days before the date of effectiveness of the Form

reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope for comfort
letters delivered by independent accountants in connection with registration
statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to approve in

(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) to or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each officer or director of Parent or the Company who is

Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby) with respect to equity securities of Parent or the Company.

shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control

its respective operations.



 

84 Section 5.16 _Financing Commitments_.

Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to Parent and Merger Subs obtaining the Financing that are within their
control, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment Letter, and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without the Companys
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to,
agree to or permit any amendment, replacement, supplement, or other
modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the Financing
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing
Commitment Letter (including any and all fee letters), if such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay, or materially impede the consummation
of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
_provided_ _that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may
(without the prior consent of the Company) replace and amend the Financing
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication
agents, or similar entities that had not executed the Financing Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement, so long as any such addition would
not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder, or materially delay
the consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, or modification
of any of the Financing Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section
5.16(a), the term " _Financing Commitment Letter_ " shall mean the Financing
Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented, or modified in
accordance with this Section 5.16(a), and the term " _Financing_ " shall mean
the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified.

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material breach
by any party of any of the Financing Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes
aware or any termination of the Financing Commitment Letter. Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of material developments with respect to the status of its efforts to arrange
and consummate the Financing.

and shall cause the respective officers and employees of the Company, and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Representatives of the
Company to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is necessary or reasonably required in connection
with the Financing, including the following: (i) causing the Companys senior
officers to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions, and sessions with rating agencies; (ii) assisting
with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda and similar
documents reasonably required in connection with the Financing; (iii)
assisting with the preparation of any pledge and security documents, any loan
agreement, currency or interest hedging agreement, and other definitive
financing documents on terms satisfactory to Parent,  



 

85   _provided_ _that_ no obligation of the Company under any such document or
agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) facilitating the
pledging of collateral, _provided_ _that_ no pledge shall be effective until
the Effective Time; (v) furnishing on a confidential basis to Parent and
Merger Sub and their financing sources, as promptly as practicable, with such
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial statements and other
financial data required by the Financing Commitment Letter (the " _Required
Information_ "); (vi) requesting the Companys independent auditors to prepare
and deliver "comfort letters," dated the date of each offering document used
in connection with any transaction in connection with the Financing (with
appropriate bring-down comfort letters delivered on the closing date of the
Financing), in compliance with professional standards and otherwise on terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be; and (vii)
requesting that the administrative agent and collateral agent under the
existing credit facility of the Company provide a debt payoff letter and
related ancillary agreements, in each of the foregoing cases as may be
necessary and customary in connection with a financing substantially similar
to the Financing; _provided_ _that_ nothing in this Agreement shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment,
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ _further_ that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, until the Effective Time occurs, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or obligation under
any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document
related to the Financing, or (3) be required to incur any other liability in
connection with the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees, and Representatives from and against
any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives),
except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from the
willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Representatives.

things necessary, proper or advisable (a) to form a Delaware corporation, all
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of which shall be owned by Parent
(the " _Name Change Sub_ "), and (b) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
to merge  



 

86  the Name Change Sub with and into Parent pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL, with Parent surviving, for the sole purpose of changing the name of
Parent to "Applied Biosystems, Inc." (the " _Parent Name Change_ ").

Section 5.19 _Consents_. From and after the date hereof, Parent and the
Company will each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any material consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries respective contracts required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent, if the Board of
Directors of each so determines;

(b) by written notice of either the Company or Parent (as authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable):

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by March 11, 2009 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before such Outside Date; and _provided_ _further_ that if on the Outside Date
all conditions to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set
forth in Article VI of this Agreement (other than those that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing) are satisfied except that the Company or
Parent shall not yet have obtained any Required Approval arising under
Regulatory Laws, then the Outside Date shall automatically be extended until
June 11, 2009;

(ii) if a Governmental Entity that is of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of permanently

decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable; _provided_ that
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(b)(ii) shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to contest,
appeal and remove such order, decree or ruling; 



 

90 (iii) if the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, or at any adjournment, postponement or
continuation thereof, at which the vote was taken; or

Company Stockholders Meeting, or at any adjournment, postponement or
continuation thereof, at which the vote was taken.

(c) by the Company (as authorized by its Board of Directors) upon a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue and in any such case such breach shall be incapable of being
cured or shall not have been cured in all material respects within the earlier
of the Outside Date or thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall
have been received by Parent; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the
Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements such that the conditions in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b)
are incapable of being satisfied;

(d) by Parent (as authorized by its Board of Directors) upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become

Outside Date or thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have
been received by the Company; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if Parent is then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements such that the conditions in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) are
incapable of being satisfied;

(e) by the Company (as authorized by its Board of Directors), at any time

Directors or any committee thereof, for any reason, shall have (i) failed to

5.5(b), (ii) failed to include in the Joint Proxy Statement distributed to the
stockholders of the Company the recommendation of the Companys Board of
Directors that such stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and approve

91 (g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, if
(i) the Company receives a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4,
(ii) the Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that the

a Superior Proposal; (iv) the Company has complied in all material respects

stockholders as the Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company
shall not enter into any such binding agreement during the Notice Period; and
(vi) the Company, at or prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(g), pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee. 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or Company as provided in Section 7.1 of this
Agreement and, if applicable, any payment of a Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination Fee, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability on the part of any of the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries, officers or directors except (i) as set forth in Section 5.3,
5.11, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII (other than Section 8.1)
to the extent applicable to such surviving sections, each of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement, and (ii) that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any further liability for any willful or intentional
breach of any representation or warranty of such party contained herein
or any breach of any covenant or agreement of such party contained herein. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.
Payments made pursuant to Section 7.3 shall be in addition to any other
rights, remedies and relief of the parties hereto or with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Payments_.

(a)  _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(g) or (ii) (A) any person shall have made an
Alternative Transaction Proposal for the Company after the date hereof which
proposal has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(iv) and (B) within twelve (12) months after the termination of this
Agreement, an Alternative Transaction shall have been consummated or any
definitive agreement with respect to such Alternative Transaction shall have
been entered into, the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $150 million
in immediately available funds (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ")
simultaneously with such termination, in the case of a termination described
in clause (i) above, or promptly upon such fee becoming payable under clause
(ii) above, in the event of a termination described in clause (ii) above. For
 



 

92  the purposes of the foregoing clause (ii)(B) above, the term "Alternative
Transaction" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4 of
this Agreement except that the references to "25%" in the definition of
"Alternative Transaction" in Section 5.4 of this Agreement shall be deemed to
be references to "50%."

(b) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or (ii) (A) any person
shall have made an Alternative Transaction Proposal for Parent after the date
hereof which proposal has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) and (B) within twelve (12) months after the termination of
this Agreement, an Alternative Transaction shall have been consummated or any
definitive agreement with respect to such Alternative Transaction shall have
been entered into, Parent shall pay the Company a fee equal to $150 million in
immediately available funds (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") simultaneously
with such termination, in the case of a termination described in clause (i)
above, or promptly upon such fee becoming payable under clause (ii) above, in
the event of a termination described in clause (ii) above. For the purposes of
the foregoing clause (B) above, the term "Alternative Transaction" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.4 of this Agreement except that
the references to "25%" in the definition of "Alternative Transaction" in
Section 5.4 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

(c) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. All payments under this Section
7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the party to receive payment. Each of Parent and the
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the other party hereto would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to
pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 and, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party hereto makes a claim that
results in a judgment against the party failing to pay for the amounts set
forth in this Section 7.3, the party so failing to pay shall pay to the other
party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.3 at the rate of interest per annum
publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A. (or any successor thereto or other
major money center commercial bank agreed to by the parties hereto) as its
prime rate at its principal office in New York City, as in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees described in this
Section 7.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the respective
stockholders of the Company and Parent and prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in writing by the Company and Parent
with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except that
following approval by the stockholders of the Company and Parent there shall
be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by such shareholders without such further approval nor any amendment
or change not permitted under applicable Law.



 

93 Section 7.5 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and Parent may:

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or 

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
