ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub or the
Company:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries or by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "Excluded
Shares") shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid for Excluded Shares.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, but including any restricted shares of
Company Common Stock granted under any of the Company Equity Plans) shall be
converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been so
converted shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates ("Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry
Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented those
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to
those shares of Company Common Stock, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with Section 2.2.

  

  

(d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if,
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Company Common Stock) with a record date during such period,
then the Merger Consideration payable under Section 2.1(c) shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 2.2 Surrender of Certificates.

  

.

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank
or trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable judgment, to
act as the paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and (ii) enter into
a customary paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent which shall provide
for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.2.

  

  

(b) Payment Fund. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in
any event within one Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall
deposit in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock with
the Paying Agent, cash in United States dollars in an aggregate amount equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Company Common Stock owned by
Parent or held by the Company in treasury and Dissenting Shares) and (ii) the
Merger Consideration (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the
"Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall make the payments of the amounts
referred to in Section 2.1(c) out of the Payment Fund.

  

  

(c) Payment Procedures.

  

  

(i) Letter of Transmittal. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within three Business Days) following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, as applicable, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form,
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (B) instructions for
surrendering Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.

  

  

(ii) Surrender of Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documents required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of that Book-Entry Share or the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, as applicable,
less any required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

  

  

(iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so long as (A)
the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment
(1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2) establishes to the satisfaction
of Parent and the Paying Agent that any such transfer Taxes have already been
paid or are not applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to that
Certificate (including the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by it) or Book-Entry Share, as applicable.

  

  

(d) No Further Transfers. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Required Withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration
or Option Merger Consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under (i) the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Laws or (iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts
are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be (i)
paid by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable tax authorities when due
and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

  

(g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent; provided, that any such investment shall in all events
be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities
of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Payment Fund, and any amounts in the Payment Fund in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 2.1(c) shall be paid promptly to Parent.

  

  

(h) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares 270 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon
demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who has
not complied with this Article II shall look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such Person of a bond in the form required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger
Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate.

  

  

Section 2.3 Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all requisite action, including amending or interpreting any
Company Equity Plan or award agreement thereunder and obtaining consents, if
necessary, from holders of options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
that have been granted under any of the Company Equity Plans (each, a "Company
Stock Option") so that immediately prior to the Effective Time all Company
Stock Options shall vest and become exercisable and, as of the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option with an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration (an "In-The-Money Option"),
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company Stock Option, shall be canceled
and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay and shall, to the extent
necessary, provide the Surviving Corporation with sufficient funds to pay), as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to (i) the Option Merger Consideration multiplied by
(ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time. "Option Merger Consideration" means the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable
Company Stock Option. Following the Effective Time, no In-The-Money Option
shall remain outstanding, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.3(a). If the exercise price per share
of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then, from and after the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder of such Company Stock Option, such Company Stock Option shall
(i) be adjusted so that the holder of such Company Stock Option shall have the
right to receive, upon exercise of such Company Stock Option, solely an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the applicable Company
Stock Option is exercised, and (ii) expire, terminate and have no further
force and effect upon the date that is the later of the Effective Time and the
expiration of the 30-day period immediately following the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting at which the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, to the
extent then otherwise outstanding and unexercised.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all requisite action so that any restricted share of Company Common
Stock that was granted under any of the Company Equity Plans and is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Restricted Share") shall vest and by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that
Restricted Share, shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration referred to in Section 2.1(c) for each such Restricted Share.
For purposes of Sections 2.1 and 2.2, all references to shares of Company
Common Stock shall be deemed to include Restricted Shares.

  

  

Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Common Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the
appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (x) all Dissenting
Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist and (y) the holder or holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to
them under Section 262 of the DGCL.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holder's Company Common Stock (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instrument served on the Company under the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not offer to make, agree to make, or make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal without the prior written consent of
Parent.

(a) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
designed to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, and the Company has not received written or oral notice
from the Company's independent auditors or any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries involved in the design or maintenance of such system, and
otherwise there is no Knowledge of the Company that such system of internal
controls is not sufficient to carry out such objective. The Company maintains
a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and the Company has not
received written or oral notice from the Company's independent auditors or any
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries involved in the design or
maintenance of such system, and otherwise there is no Knowledge of the
Company, that such system of disclosure controls and procedures is not
sufficient to carry out such objective.

  

  

(b) The Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have disclosed to the Company's independent auditors and to the audit
committee of the Company's board of directors (i) all significant deficiencies
known or reasonably suspected by such officers in the design or operation of
such disclosure controls and procedures which would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data (including identifying for the Company's independent
auditors any material weaknesses in such disclosure controls and procedures),
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, known or reasonably suspected by
such officers that involves management or other employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in such disclosure
controls and procedures.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all effective
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

are being maintained in accordance with all applicable legal and accounting
requirements in all material respects.

  

  

Section 3.16 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements, in each case including the related notes, of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries included or incorporated by

(i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto as in effect on the date of filing thereof;

  

  

(ii) were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated in the notes to those financial statements); and

  

  

(iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates

the Company SEC Reports contains any error, misstatement or omission requiring
a restatement or material adjustment of the financial statements of the

Qualifying SEC Report and, except as set forth in Section 3.16(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has no intention to restate or
materially adjust any of such financial statements (including the related
notes) included in the Company SEC Reports. The Company has not had any
dispute with Ernst and Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its
past two full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date that is
currently outstanding or that has resulted in any restatement of any Company
SEC Report filed with the SEC subsequent to January 1, 2008 or any material
adjustment to the financial statements of the Company contained in any such
Company SEC Report after the date of filing thereof with the SEC. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned
nor been dismissed as independent public accounting firm of the Company as a
result of or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

in connection with any disagreement with the Company on a matter of accounting
practices which impacts or would require the restatement or material

financial statements, such that they should no longer be relied on.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Letters,

(a) there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect; and

  

  

(b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action

extent that it pertains to Subsections (c), (d), (g), (j), (m) and (n),
Subsection (o) thereof), other than as set forth in Section 3.18 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

in Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no legal
actions, claims, demands, arbitrations, hearings, charges, complaints,
investigations, examinations, indictments, litigations, suits or other civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative proceedings (collectively, "Legal
Actions") pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
otherwise affecting (a) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Assets or (b) any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Person for whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may be liable, in each case other than Legal Actions that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There are no material Orders which have been served upon the

Subsidiaries.

(a) There are no Company Contracts required to be described in, or filed as an
exhibit to, any Company SEC Report that are not so described or filed as
required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be. The
Company has made available to Parent correct and complete (except for the
redaction of pricing information) copies of all Company Contracts that are
material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

  

  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, all Company Contracts are valid and binding, in full force and
effect and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as

default (with or without notice or the lapse of time or both) under, any
Company Contracts and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no other Person is in
violation or breach of, or in default (with or without notice or the lapse of
time or both) under, any Company Contracts.

Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, no Person set
forth in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter (a) to the Knowledge of
the Company (which for the avoidance of doubt excludes any duty on the part of
the Company to make any additional inquiries of any customer or supplier), has
threatened or intends to terminate the relationship of such Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) has materially modified or
decreased materially or, to the Knowledge of the Company (which for the
avoidance of doubt excludes any duty on the part of the Company to make any
additional inquiries of any customer or supplier), has threatened or intends
to materially modify its relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or intends to decrease materially its purchases from, or supplies
to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 3.22 Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Section 3.22(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all Employee Benefit Plans
maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliates of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans").

  

  

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has provided to
Parent a correct and complete copy of: (i) such Company Benefit Plan and all
amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
determination or opinion letter, if applicable; (iii) the annual report (Form
5500), if any, filed with the IRS and attached schedules, and audited
financial statements and actuarial valuation reports for the three most
recently completed plan years; (iv) each trust agreement, group annuity
contract or other funding instrument; (v) the most recent summary plan
description and summary of material modifications, if any, relating to such
Company Benefit Plan; and (vi) for the last three years, all correspondence
with the IRS, the United States Department of Labor (the "DOL"), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), SEC or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the operation or the administration of any Company Benefit
Plan.

  

  

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with (i) ERISA, (ii) the Code, (iii) all other
applicable Laws, and (iv) its terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which material contributions have not been timely made or
properly accrued to the extent required by GAAP. All amounts accrued as
liabilities or expenses of any Company Benefit Plan have been properly
reflected in the most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Reports, to the extent required by GAAP. Since the date of such financial
statements, there has been no amendment or change in interpretation by the
Company relating to any Company Benefit Plan which would materially increase
the cost of such Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a determination or opinion letter from the IRS
to the effect that such Company Benefit Plan is qualified and the plans and
trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. No such determination or opinion
letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened. No such
Company Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most
recent determination or opinion letter or application therefor in any respect
that is reasonably likely to result in the loss of such qualification or
materially increase its cost.

  

  

(f) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates have within the past six years (i) maintained a Company
Benefit Plan that was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of
ERISA or (ii) been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or any "multiple employer plan" within
the meaning of the Code or ERISA. Neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Company Benefit Plan nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) or "party
in interest" (as defined in Section 3(18) of ERISA), has engaged in any non-
exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406 of ERISA) which, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted
or could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.22(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
none of the Company Benefit Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by applicable
Law under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA")
and at the expense of the employee or former employee.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.22(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Requisite Company
Vote nor the consummation of the transactions expressly contemplated by this
Agreement could (either alone or in combination with another event) result in:
(i) any severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement; (ii) any payment, compensation or
benefit becoming due, or any increase in the amount of any payment,
compensation or benefit due, to any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting or in any funding (through a
grantor trust or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

otherwise) of compensation or benefits to any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iv) any material obligation pursuant to any of the Company Benefit Plans; or
(v) any limitation or restriction on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans.

  

  

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code is and has
been in compliance in form and operation with Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable guidance and regulations thereunder. No payment pursuant to any
Company Benefit Plan or other arrangement with any "service provider" (as such
term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and the United States Treasury
Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder), including the grant, vesting or
exercise of any stock option or other equity award, would subject any person
to Tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(j) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with all Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes pursuant to
Sections 3121 and 3402 of the Code, or similar provisions under any applicable
Tax Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries have within the time and the manner
prescribed by Law, withheld from and paid over to the proper Governmental
Entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under all
applicable Laws.

  

  

(k) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan: (i) no material Legal Actions
or liens (other than routine claims for benefits) are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened; (ii) no facts or circumstances exist
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Legal Actions;
(iii) no written or oral communication has been received from the PBGC
concerning the funded status of any Company Benefit Plan or any transfer of
assets and liabilities from any Company Benefit Plan in connection with the
transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) no
administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the
DOL, the PBGC, the IRS or any other Governmental Entity (including pursuant to
the Employee Plans Compliance Resolutions System) is pending or in progress
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (including any routine
requests for information from the PBGC).

  

  

(l) For each Company Benefit Plan with respect to which a Form 5500 has been
filed, no material change has occurred with respect to the matters covered by
the most recent Form since the date of such Form. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any plan, contract or commitment, or has announced
(orally or in writing) an intention, to create any additional employee benefit
or compensation plans, policies or arrangements or, except as may be required
by applicable Law, to modify, suspend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(m) Other than as set forth in Section 3.22(m) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G) is
entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person in the event that
the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such
"disqualified individual." Section 3.22(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a good faith estimated calculation, as of the date of this
Agreement, of: (i) the "base amount" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3)
of the Code) for each "disqualified individual"; and (ii) the maximum amount
that could be paid or provided to each such "disqualified individual" as a

include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date taxable income
attributable to income that accrued in a taxable period prior to the Closing
Date but was not recognized for Tax purposes in such prior taxable period as a

of accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method of
accounting or Section 481 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local
or foreign Tax law, or for any other reason, other than due to timing

in the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Intellectual Property") is either (i) owned by the Company or one or
more of its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Intellectual Property") or (ii) used by
the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid license
Contract (the "Licensed Intellectual Property"), or otherwise in a manner that
does not infringe any patent, copyright or trademark or misappropriate any
trade secret of any Person.

  

  

(b) Section 3.27(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list of (i) all Owned Intellectual Property that is registered,
issued or the subject of a pending application, and (ii) all material
unregistered trademarks included in the Owned Intellectual Property. Except as
set forth in Section 3.27(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all such
registrations and issuances have not expired or been canceled, invalidated,
held unenforceable, abandoned or otherwise terminated, and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, such registrations and issuances are valid and in full force
and effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.27(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries own and possess all right, title and
interest in and to the Owned Intellectual Property free and clear of all
Liens, provided that IP Licenses (as defined below) set forth in Section

Property that do not constitute material Contracts shall not be deemed Liens.

  

  

(c) Section 3.27(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete list of all material Contracts (i) pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries use any Licensed Intellectual Property, or (ii)
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has granted to a

material respects a valid and enforceable obligation of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto. For purposes of the foregoing, an IP License shall be deemed
to be valid and enforceable in all material respects even if certain
provisions of such IP License are invalid or unenforceable, provided that such
invalidity or unenforceability does not deprive any party to such IP License
of the principal benefit of its bargain under such IP License. None of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the other
parties thereto is in material breach or violation of, or default under, any
IP License. Upon the Closing, except as set forth in Section 3.27(c) of the

substantially the same terms and conditions as the Company or such
Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing.

Company and its Subsidiaries does not infringe or otherwise violate any

threatened alleging any such infringement or violation or challenging the
Company's

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

   
 

or any of its Subsidiaries' rights in or to any Company Intellectual Property.
To the Knowledge of the Company (which for the avoidance of doubt shall
exclude any duty on the part of the Company to make any inquiries outside the
Company and its Subsidiaries), except as set forth in Section 3.27(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no Person is infringing or otherwise violating any
Owned Intellectual Property or any Licensed Intellectual Property in any
material respect.

whole, all software that is material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) performs in material conformance with its documentation, and
(ii) does not contain any virus, software routine or hardware component
designed to permit unauthorized access or to disable or otherwise harm any
computer, systems or software, or any software routine designed to disable a
computer program automatically with the passage of time or under the positive
control of a Person other than an authorized licensee or owner of the

lease documents (including all amendments, supplements, modifications,

marketable title to, or has a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in, as
applicable, all Real Property (including all buildings, fixtures and other
improvements) owned, used or held for use by them, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company's nor any of its Subsidiaries' ownership of or leasehold
interest in any such real property is subject to any Liens, except for Liens
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or as set forth in Section 3.28 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Since March 31, 2010, no Real Property has been taken by eminent
domain or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is the subject of a pending or
contemplated taking that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.29 Personal Property. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to, or a valid and enforceable leasehold interest
in, all personal Company Assets owned, used or held for use by them, except as

Effect. Neither the Company's nor any of its Subsidiaries' ownership of or
leasehold interest in any such personal Company Assets is subject to any
Liens, except for Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in Section 3.29 of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Except for normal wear and tear, the machinery and

possession thereof would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Company, all such Company Permits
are in full force and effect in all material respects. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened. To the Knowledge of the Company, no such suspension

taken all necessary action to ensure that the restrictions on business
combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions expressly contemplated by this

against any Person with respect thereto and (vi) the Company has made

(c) The Financing Agreements are in full force and effect, are legal, valid
and binding obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are a party
thereto, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither the Stock Purchase Agreement nor the Debt Commitment Letter has been
amended or modified and the commitments set forth in the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, canceled or
rescinded. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both), would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, or to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the
Stock Purchase Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, other than any default
or breach resulting from any action by, or otherwise relating to, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of the Company's
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, as of the date of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the
Closing. Except for fee letters with respect to fees, market flex and related
arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing (which in no event shall
modify the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Debt Financing) or
as described in Section 4.7(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date
of this Agreement there are no side letters or other Contracts related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid or caused to be paid any and all
commitment and other fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred and are
due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with
the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

Section 4.8 Solvency. Immediately following the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent (assuming for the purposes of
this representation that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries was Solvent
immediately prior to the Effective Time).

  

  

Section 4.9 Company Proxy Statement Information; Other Filings. The
information provided by Parent or Merger Sub relating to Parent, Merger Sub or
any Subsidiary of Parent expressly for inclusion in the Company Proxy
Statement will not, at the time the Company Proxy Statement is first mailed
and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Any such information
that is to be so provided or so confirmed shall be specifically identified and
agreed upon in writing, in advance, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 4.10 Brokers and Finders. No broker, finder or investment bank other
than Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., and no consultant other than Republic
Partners is entitled, as relevant, to any brokerage, finder's, consultant's or
other fee or commission in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

including by way of providing access to non-public information to a Person in

not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent.

  

  

(c) From and after the Go-Shop End Date and continuing until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII, except as specifically permitted in Section 5.3(f), the Company
shall not, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct and

with the obligations of the Company under this Section 5.3.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Immediately following the Go-Shop End Date: (i) the Company shall, shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries, and shall instruct and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease any
existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person that has

Section 5.3 by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at
the direction or with the Knowledge of the Company or the express consent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.3 by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the
other provisions of this Section 5.3(d), the Company may continue to take any
of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 5.3(c) from and
after the Go-Shop End Date with respect to any party that has made a bona
fide, written Takeover Proposal (as determined in good faith by the board of
directors of the Company after taking into account all amendments and
supplements by such party from time to time prior to such determination) prior
to the Go-Shop End Date with respect to which the requirements of clauses (x)
and (y) of Section 5.3(f)(i)(B) have been satisfied as of the Go-Shop End Date
(each such party, an "Excluded Party"), but only for so long as such party
does not cease to be an Excluded Party. The Company shall deliver to Parent
within twenty-four (24) hours following the Go-Shop End Date, a list of all
Excluded Parties as of the Go-Shop End Date, if any, and a summary of all
material terms and conditions and the status of the Takeover Proposals made by
each such Excluded Party. From time to time after the Go-Shop End Date the
Company shall provide updates on any material changes to any summaries
previously provided pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence promptly
(and in any event not later than twenty-four (24) hours after such material
changes occur). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Excluded Party shall irrevocably cease to be an Excluded Party
for all purposes under this Agreement immediately upon the earlier of (1) such
time as the Takeover Proposal (as amended or supplemented by such Excluded
Party from time to time) made by such Excluded Party is withdrawn or is
terminated or expires in accordance with its terms and (2) such time as the
Takeover Proposal (as amended or supplemented by such Excluded Party from time
to time) made by such Excluded Party first fails to satisfy the requirements
of clauses (x) and (y) of Section 5.3(f)(i)(B).

  

  

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any case within twenty-
four (24) hours) upon receipt after the Go-Shop End Date of (i) any Takeover
Proposal or indication that any Person is considering making a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall provide Parent promptly
(and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) with the identity of such
Person and a copy of such Takeover Proposal, indication or request (or, where
no such copy is available, a detailed description of such Takeover Proposal).
The Company shall keep Parent fully informed on a current basis (and in any
case within twenty-four (24) hours) of the status and details of any such
Takeover

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Proposal, indication or request, and any related communications to or by the
Company or its Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of,
or grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that relates to a
Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
take commercially reasonable steps to enforce the provisions of any such
agreement. The Company has not entered into any agreement prior to the date
hereof, and will not enter into any agreement following the date hereof, that
would prevent the Company from providing any of the information described in
this Section 5.3(e) to Parent.

  

  

(f) Subject to the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Section
5.3 (other than any immaterial breach of this Section 5.3 that has not
resulted in any prejudice or disadvantage to Parent or Merger Sub), from the
date of this Agreement and only until the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
the Company and its board of directors shall be permitted to:

  

  

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with:

  

  

(A) an Excluded Party, but only for so long as such Person remains an Excluded
Party; and

  

  

(B) from and after the Go-Shop End Date, any Person who has made a bona fide,
written and unsolicited Takeover Proposal if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal (as amended or
supplemented by such Person from time to time prior to such determination), if
accepted, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, but only so
long as the board of directors has (x) determined in good faith, after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or another nationally-
recognized and independent financial advisory firm (each, an "Experienced
Financial Advisor") that such Takeover Proposal (as amended or supplemented by
Person from time to time) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (y) determined in good faith, after consultation with Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP or other nationally-recognized legal counsel for the Company that
is experienced in the relevant legal matters (each, an "Experienced Counsel"),
that such action is required to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws;

any of its Subsidiaries to:

  

  

(A) an Excluded Party, but only so long as the Company (x) has caused such
Excluded Party to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on
terms and conditions determined in good faith by the Company's board of
directors to be no less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate, than those
contained in the Confidentiality

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any
provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation
to provide the required disclosure to Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or
other obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 and (y) promptly (and in any
case within twenty-four (24) hours) discloses the same such non-public
information to Parent; and

  

  

(B) from and after the Go-Shop End Date, any Person who has made a bona fide,
written and unsolicited Takeover Proposal if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal (as amended or
supplemented by such Person from time to time prior to such determination) is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, but only so long as the
Company (x) has caused such Person to enter into a confidentiality agreement
with the Company on terms and conditions determined in good faith by the
Company's board of directors to be no less favorable to the Company, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided
that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that
would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide the
required disclosure to Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or other obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.3 and (y) promptly (and in any case within twenty-
four (24) hours) discloses the same such non-public information to Parent;

  

  

(iii) subject to Section 7.4(a), withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, if the board of directors of the
Company has (A) determined in good faith, after consultation with Experienced
Counsel, that such action is required to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws and (B) provided
Parent with at least two (2) Business Days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action; or

  

  

(iv) subject to Section 7.4(a), approve, endorse or recommend a bona fide,
written Takeover Proposal from an Excluded Party and, following the Go-Shop
End Date, a Person making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal, in any case, if
the board of directors of the Company has (A) determined in good faith, after
consultation with its Experienced Financial Advisor, that such Takeover
Proposal (as amended or supplemented by such Excluded Party or other Person
from time to time prior to such determination) constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (B) provided Parent with at least two (2) Business Days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action.

board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to disclose to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) the Company shall be
permitted to disclose publicly through appropriate means the fact that the
board of directors of the Company has received a Takeover Proposal and the
terms of such proposal, if the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with Experienced Counsel, that it is required
to make such disclosure to comply with obligations under U.S. federal
securities Laws or Nasdaq rules.

obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable

plans or arrangements, or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Closing; or (iv) constitute an amendment to any Company
Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan, or other employee benefit or compensation
plans or arrangements. Nothing in this Section 5.7 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to make any employee, former employee, independent
contractor or Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.7 or any rights relating
hereto.

services as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
occurring prior to the Effective Time in respect of which such Indemnified
Party would be entitled to be indemnified by the Company, which Legal Action
continues or is initiated after the Effective Time, then following the

incurred such Indemnified Party's legal fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such Legal Action, subject to receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such legal fees, costs and

divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Effective Time, any assets,
businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) any conditions relating to, or
changes or restriction in, the operations of any such assets or businesses

case of a proposed announcement or statement by the Company; provided,
however, that (i) the Company may, without the prior consent of Parent, issue

the rights of Parent under the Stock Purchase Agreement. Parent shall not,
prior to the termination of this Agreement, terminate or agree to terminate

amend, alter or waive, any term of the Stock Purchase Agreement that would
reduce the aggregate purchase price to be paid to Parent thereunder or that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the closing of the Financing
under the Stock Purchase Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, in each
case, without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be withheld
by the Company in its sole discretion). Not later than two Business Days prior
to any other amendment, modification or waiver of the Stock Purchase Agreement
(other than immaterial amendments that will not have the effect of reducing
the aggregate purchase price or delaying or preventing the closing of the
transactions thereunder), Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of any
such amendment, modification or waiver and shall afford the Company an

Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, after giving effect to the
"market flex" terms in the fee letter referred to therein (or on terms which

Merger, the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing), and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms which would

Equity Financing or the Debt Financing), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in such definitive
agreements that are within their reasonable control, and (iii) consummate the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to the

Persons providing such Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt

this Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under the Financing
Agreements.

  

  

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, prior to the termination of this
Agreement, terminate or agree to terminate the Debt Commitment Letter without

amend, alter or waive, any term of the Debt Commitment Letter or any provision
of the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent any
such amendment, alteration, or waiver would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
may be withheld by the Company in its sole discretion); provided, however,
that Parent and Merger Sub may replace the Debt Commitment Letter without the
need to obtain the consent of the Company so long as (i) the terms would not
be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing and (ii) the conditions
to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
of this Agreement would not be expanded in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the Closing; and in any such event, Parent shall
disclose to the Company its intention to obtain such alternative financing,
shall keep the Company informed of the terms thereof and shall deliver to the
Company final drafts of the commitment letter (the "New Debt Commitment
Letter") providing for such alternative financing. The term "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to refer to the New Debt Commitment Letter from and
after such time as it replaces the original Debt Commitment Letter. The term
"Debt Financing" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not so superseded at
the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in
effect. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)
notify the Company of the expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter and its replacement with the New Debt Commitment Letter (if
applicable).

systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in connection

consummation of the Available Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to
be made available immediately upon the Effective Time.
