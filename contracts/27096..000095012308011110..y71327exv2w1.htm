   ##### 

  

    

(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(c),
contain the Company Recommendation. The Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable law. Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9
before it is filed with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide

shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may

and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel. 

  

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated promptly from time to time upon Purchasers request, and their addresses and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its agent may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver to the Company all copies of such information. 

  

 (d) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser and Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Merger Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Merger Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than the number of Shares necessary for Purchaser to be merged with and into the Company pursuant to the Section 253 of the DGCL, as certified by the Company, for consideration per Merger Option Share equal to the Offer Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Merger Option shall not be exercisable if (i) the issuance of the Merger Option Shares would require shareholder approval under the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ (the " _Nasdaq Marketplace Rules_ ") or (ii) the number of Merger Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized shares of the Company. The Merger Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer and any subsequent offering period

 (e) In the event that Parent or Purchaser wishes to exercise the Merger Option, Purchaser shall give the Company one (1) days written notice specifying the number of Shares that are or will be owned by Parent and Purchaser following consummation of the Offer and specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of Merger Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Merger Option Shares, the portion of the purchase price owed upon exercise of the Merger Option that equals the product of (i) the number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Merger Option, multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price, shall be paid to the Company, at the election of Parent and Purchaser, in cash (or by wire transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a promissory note with a market terms, with interest and principal payable solely on the one (1) year maturity of the note, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Continuing Directors. 

  

 Section 1.3. _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after Purchaser accepts for payment and pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, such directors to be split up among the three classes of the Company Board of Directors so as to keep the classes approximately even in number of directors. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any time following the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, take such actions, including but not limited to promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of the Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are necessary or desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request following the Appointment Time, also cause Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law and the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Companys obligations under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) the 

   ##### 

  

    

information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board of
Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with respect
to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as
a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise. 

  

 (b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall seek to cause the Company Board of Directors to maintain at least three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of Directors on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the Company Board of Directors) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three (3) Persons to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended, the " _Company Certificate_ "), the Bylaws of the Company (as amended, the " _Company Bylaws_ ", and together with the Company Certificate, the " _Company Governing Documents_ ") or applicable law) be required (i) for the Company to amend or terminate this Agreement; (ii) to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder; (iii) to amend the Company Governing Documents; or (iv) to take any other action of the Company Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser).

Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter 

   ##### 

  

    

of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or will accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest
thereon. 

  

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange the Shares in accordance with this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the first anniversary after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant

    ##### 

  

  

Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; _provided_ , that the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such Shares and shall instead be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. 

  

 (b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 Section 2.4. _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards_. 

  

 (a) Each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the 

    ##### 

  

  

Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a payment in cash,
payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price
per share for such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
Shares for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been
exercised, whether or not then vested or exercisable. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash
payments described in this Section 2.4(a) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 to any holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (c) Subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall cause each restricted share subject to a restricted stock award (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be vested and transferable immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Each outstanding deferred share unit (each, a " _Director Deferred Share_ ") that is outstanding and held by current or former directors of the Company under the Datascope Corp. Amended and Restated Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Datascope Corp. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars, equal to the Merger Consideration (with such amount to be rounded to the nearest cent), and distributable in cash in accordance with the participants prior distribution election and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan and agreement pursuant to which the Director Deferred Shares were issued. 

  

 (e) The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such necessary resolutions with respect to Company Stock Options, Director Deferred Shares and Restricted Shares to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4, including amendments to the Company Stock Plans to allow the payments described in this Section 2.4 to be made to holders of Company Stock Options or Director Deferred Shares without any action of the stockholders of the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options or Restricted Stock (other than with respect to the directors of the Company). The Company shall take such actions as are necessary or appropriate so that, as of the Effective Time the Company Stock Plans shall be terminated.

 Section 4.10. _No Other Information_. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly set forth in Article III. 

  

 Section 4.11. _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 Section 5.3. _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the Appointment Time or, if earlier, the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, shall cause all of the Subsidiaries and the Companys and such Subsidiaries respective officers and directors not to, and shall not authorize or permit its non-officer employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making or submission of, or any inquiry, offer, proposal or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or disclose or provide any non-public information with respect to, any person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries and Representatives) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement, arrangement, undertaking, contract, commitment or understanding (including any agreement in principle or letter of intent

any existing solicitation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation
with any Third Party heretofore conducted by the Company, the Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Transaction and request the prompt return or destruction of

 (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 5.3(a), if, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Appointment Time, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party under circumstances in which the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives have complied with the Companys obligations under Section 5.3(a) and (ii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (such consultation with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, " _After Consultation_ ") that (A) such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take the action in (1) or (2) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 5.3(a), and after entering into a confidentiality agreement with the Third Party containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (1) furnish information to such Third Party, with respect to the Company and Subsidiary, provided that all such information has been provided to Parent or is provide to Parent at the same time, or (2) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party regarding such Acquisition Proposal (including by requesting that such Third Party amend the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that it may be a Superior Proposal). 

   

 (c) In addition to any prior notice obligations contained in Section 5.3(b), the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally or in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information or inquiry that the Company receives which relates to or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include, (i) the material terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (ii) the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent promptly informed of the status and details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) issuing a "stop-look-and listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) or taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) otherwise disclosing any information to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (After Consultation) that the failure to disclose such information would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; provided that each issuance or disclosure shall be subject to 

   ##### 

  

   

compliance with the requirements of Sections 5.3(a), (b), and (c) and any
Company Change in Recommendation shall be subject to compliance with the
requirements of Section 5.4(b). 

   

 (e) The Company represents and warrants that it has not released or waived, and agrees that it shall not release or waive, any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement: 

    

 (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer, proposal or indication of interest, whether or not in writing, as the case may be, by any Person that relates to an Acquisition Transaction; 

   

 (ii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means any transaction, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to acquire beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of (i) assets that constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) twenty percent (20%) or more (in number or voting power) of any class of equity securities or other capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (if the securities or ownership interests acquired in such Subsidiaries represent an amount equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in any such case pursuant to any transaction or series of transactions, including without limitation (w) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other business combination (including without limitation any so-called merger-of-equals and whether or not the Company is the entity surviving any such transaction) involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (x) sale, issuance, exchange, transfer or other disposition of shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (z) tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with respect to either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party or another Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of assets that constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or twenty percent (20%) or more of the equity interest in either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (if the securities or ownership interests acquired in such Subsidiaries represent an amount equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and 

   

 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal which if consummated would result in such person owning, directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the shares then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in the merger) or greater than 50% of the assets of the Company, which the Company Board of Directors 

   ##### 

  

  

determines in good faith, After Consultation, taking into account, among
other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects
of the Acquisition Proposal and the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal and any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal, would, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Shares (in their capacity as such) than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger (after taking into account any adjustment to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal). 

   

 Section 5.4. _Board Recommendation_. 

    

 (a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify, modify, change or amend in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser (including pursuant to the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment thereto), the Company Recommendation or the approval by the Company Board of Directors of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger or make a public statement that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation and adverse to Parent or Purchaser (a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors may effect a Company Change in Recommendation at any time prior to the Appointment Time, if: (A) (i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (After Consultation) that the failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law or (ii) the Company Board of Directors has received an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (After Consultation and after considering in good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent during the four Business-Day period contemplated by clause (C) below), that the failure to effect a Company Change in Recommendation in light of such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; (B) at least four (4) Business Days prior to such Company Change in Recommendation, the Company shall have provided to Parent a written notice (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") of its intention to make such Company Change in Recommendation (which notice shall not be deemed to be, in and of itself, a Company Change in Recommendation), which shall provide the reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal (it being understood that any material change to such terms and conditions of a Superior Proposal shall start a new four (4) Business Day period); (C) during the four Business-Day period following Parents receipt of a Notice of Recommendation Change, the Company shall have given Parent the opportunity to meet with the Company and its Representatives, and at Parents request, shall have negotiated in good faith regarding the terms of possible revisions to the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal; and (D) Parent shall not, within four (4) Business Days of Parents receipt of 

   ##### 

  

   

a Notice of Recommendation Change have made an offer that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, After Consultation, would
cause the Acquisition Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal
or that would cause such Company Change in Recommendation to cease to
exist. 

   

 Section 5.5. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and Company Foreign Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company or Parent from amending or terminating such plans, arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms and applicable Law. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Person who is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits (including without limitation paid time off and/or vacation benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (A) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the one (1) year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits that are at least equal to severance at the levels and pursuant to the terms of the Companys severance plans and policies as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) during such one (1) year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to Company Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time in compensation paid to Company Employees. Additionally, with respect to each former employee of the Company that is receiving or is entitled to receive severance or welfare benefits as of the Effective Time, the Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue or provide such benefits at the levels and pursuant to the terms of the Companys applicable severance or benefit plans and policies as in effect at the time of such former employees termination date. 

   

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, benefit accrual and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time as required pursuant to this Section 5.5 (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan (except with respect to any defined benefit plan in which such employee participated in prior to the Effective Time) or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by such plans, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such 

   ##### 

  

   

New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such Current Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Current Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Current Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Current Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Current Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan. 

   

 Section 5.6. _Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or to cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for such amounts if the Merger is terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.1. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all Notification and Report Forms required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") with respect to the Transactions, with any related filing fee to be paid by Parent, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other 

   ##### 

  

   

Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (B) timely making all such filings, with any related filing fee to be
paid by Parent, and timely obtaining all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals; (iii) supply to any Governmental Entity as
promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be
requested pursuant to any Regulatory Law or by such Governmental Entity; and
(iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby within 270 days of the date hereof. Each
party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist
the other party in the preparation of its filings and, if requested, to
promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder. Each party
shall furnish to each other all information required for any filing, form,
declaration, notification, registration and notice and to keep the other
party reasonably informed with respect to the status of each clearance,
approval or waiver sought from a Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the material
communications between such party and such Governmental Entity. Such
information and materials shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of
the other and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of their client unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the disclosing party or its legal counsel. Each party shall
consult with the other party, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party, prior to entering into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity. Parent shall have the right to determine and direct the
strategy and process by which the parties will seek required approvals,
provided, however, that Parent will consult with and consider in good faith
the views of the Company in connection therewith. Without limiting the
foregoing, such reasonable best efforts shall include, but are not limited
to, taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, including the divestiture of any business or assets of
the Company, the Parent, or both, without limitation, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or
action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Offer
and the Merger, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking
or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or
accept any operational restriction or take or commit to take any action
related to (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries (A) the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not conditional on the consummation of the Merger
or (B) that individually or in the aggregate is or would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse (either before or after giving effect to
the Offer or the Merger) to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) (with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being
measured in relation to size of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole) or (ii) Parent or its Subsidiaries (A) the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not conditional on the consummation of the Merger or
(B) that individually or in the aggregate is or would reasonably be expected
to be materially adverse (either before or after giving effect to the Offer or
the Merger) to the business of Parent and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole)
(with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation
to size of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, provided that
an undertaking, condition, consent decree, 

   ##### 

  

   

divestiture, restriction or other action involving gross revenue of
$37,500,000 or less per year, individually or in the aggregate, shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed materially adverse, solely for this purpose) (a "
_Materially Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that an
undertaking, condition, consent decree, divestiture, restriction or other
action related to the Companys endoscopic vessel harvesting business (the "
_Company s EVH Business_") shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a
Materially Burdensome Condition. Any expenses incurred by the Company, Parent

   ##### 

  

   

whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees,
as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
organization documents and in any agreement set forth on _Section 5.8 of the
Company Disclosure Letter_ shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries set
forth on _Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter_ with any of
their respective current or former directors, officers or employees, and
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at
the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action (as hereinafter
defined) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). 

   

 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such 

   ##### 

  

   

six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum
Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under
the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Insurance, and such "tail"
policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(c). 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (e) Following the Effective Time, in the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.8 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 

   

 Section 5.9. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The parties hereto shall give prompt notice to each other of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the Conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 

    ##### 

 

   

 Section 5.10. _Control of Operations_.

 Section 5.11. _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and expressly shall not be a liability of the stockholders of the Company.

For purposes of this Section 7.2(b)(ii), all references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definitive of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to refer to fifty percent (50%). 

   

 (iii) If the event that (A) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i)(B) and (B) at the time of such termination all conditions to the consummation of the Offer are satisfied or waived except for the conditions set forth in Paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of Annex I and (C)(I) in the case of such Paragraph (b) the reason any waiting period has not expired relates solely to the Companys EVH Business or (II) in the case of Paragraphs (c) or (d) the suit, action, proceeding statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction is related solely to the Companys EVH Business, the Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $30,000,000 (the " _HSR Termination Fee_ ") provided, however, the Company shall not be entitled to the HSR Termination Fee if, prior to or at the time of the termination, Parent is entitled to terminate this Agreement for any reason (excluding any cure or notice provisions) or the Company is in breach of its obligations set forth in Section 5.6 with respect to the HSR Act.

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Purchasers rights and obligations to extend or amend the Offer in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered Shares if: 

   

 (a) shares have not been tendered in the Offer such that, assuming consummation of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser would not own in the aggregate at least a majority of the Companys then fully diluted Shares (for the sake of clarity, assuming the exercise of any outstanding warrants and further assuming the grant and exercise of all options available for grant under the Companys equity incentive plans) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); 

   

 (b) any waiting period under the HSR Act or any similar foreign competition laws applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not expired or terminated prior to the termination or expiration of the Offer at or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date (the " _HSR Condition_ "); 

   

 (c) there shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction against Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary (i) challenging the acquisition by Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) of any Shares pursuant to the Offer or seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf), or render Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase any or all of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or (iii) which otherwise would impose a Materially Burdensome Condition; 

   

 (d) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government Entity to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity, other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting periods under HSR Act or similar waiting periods with respect to the any similar foreign competition laws or regulation, that (x) is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, or (y) has the effect of making such transactions illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 

   

 (e) there shall have occurred (i) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory) or (ii) any limitation or proposed limitation (whether or not mandatory) by any foreign or United States governmental authority or agency that has a material adverse effect generally on the extension of credit by banks or other financial institutions; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in Section 3.2 or 3.3 of this Agreement shall not be true and correct (except for any de minimis inaccuracy with regard to Section 3.2), (B) any other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement that is qualified by reference to a Company Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier time) or (C) any other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement that is not so qualified shall not be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of such earlier time), other than in the case of clause (C) for such failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that for purposes of determining the satisfaction of clause (C) of this condition, the representations and warranties of the Company that are not qualified by reference to a Company Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to materiality generally; 

   

 (g) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), change(s), event(s), development(s) or circumstance(s) have occurred, arisen or come into existence or become known to the Company, Parent or Purchaser, which is continuing and which has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (h) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement prior to the expiration of the Offer (or, in the case of Section 5.10 hereof, shall have intentionally breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with such Section 5.10) and such breach or failure shall not have been cured; 

   

 (i) Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company, executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated as of the scheduled Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this  _Annex I_ have not occurred; or 

   

 (j) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition, and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or requirements is so waived. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
