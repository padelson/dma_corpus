| 
---|--- 

C.

|

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Securitas Security Services
USA, Inc. has delivered to Seller a fully executed guaranty in favor of Seller
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J. 

Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows:

Article 1 
Purchase and Sale

Section 1.01. Purchased Assets; Excluded Assets. Purchaser agrees to purchase
from Seller and its Affiliates (other than Canadian Seller), and Seller agrees
to, and to cause its Affiliates (other than Canadian Seller), to, sell,
convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be sold, conveyed,
transferred, assigned and delivered, to Purchaser, at the Closing, all of
Seller's and its Affiliates' (other than Canadian Seller's) right, title and
interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets (other than the Canadian
Assets), free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. Canadian
Purchaser agrees to purchase from Canadian Seller, and Canadian Seller agrees
to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be sold conveyed,
transferred, assigned and delivered, to Canadian Purchaser, at the Closing,
all of Canadian Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the
Canadian Assets, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.
Purchaser and Canadian Purchaser will not purchase or acquire or otherwise
obtain any right, title or interest in any Excluded Asset. 

Section 1.02. Assumed Liabilities; Retained Liabilities. Effective from and
after the Closing, Purchaser will assume, and will thereafter pay, perform and
observe fully and timely, the Assumed Liabilities (other than the Canadian
Assumed Liabilities). Effective from and after the Closing, Canadian Purchaser
will assume, and will thereafter pay, perform and observe fully and timely,
the Canadian Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and
Canadian Purchaser will not assume the Retained Liabilities, which will be
retained by Seller and Canadian Seller.

Section 1.03. Affiliate Transactions.

(a) Except as contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements, or as otherwise set
forth in Section 1.03(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that all Affiliate Transactions, and all rights and obligations of
the Business or DESS thereunder, will be terminated at or prior to the
Closing, with no further Liability of Seller or its Affiliates, including
Canadian Seller (other than DESS), on the one hand, or Purchaser or DESS, on
the other hand, with respect thereto.

(b) Seller will cause all Intercompany Balances with respect to the Business
to be eliminated by discharge or otherwise in their entirety effective on or
prior to the Closing. Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all
Liabilities for Taxes related to such elimination of all Intercompany
Balances.

Section 1.04. Assignment of Contracts and Rights; Shared Contracts.

(a) This Agreement and the Transactions described herein contemplate the (i)
assignment of the Assigned Contracts to Purchaser, and (ii) transition of the
rights and obligations of the Business under the Shared Contracts to
Purchaser.

(b) The Assigned Contracts that are not subject, as of the Closing Date, to
the approval, consent or waiver of a third party thereto shall be assigned to
Purchaser as of the Closing Date (the "Transitioned Assigned Contracts"). All
other Assigned Contracts shall be assigned to Purchaser and such Assigned
Contracts shall be deemed Transitioned Assigned Contracts, as of the later of
(i) the date Approved Consent is obtained for such Contract or (ii) the
Closing Date.

(i) This Agreement does not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any
Assigned Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if and for so long as such assignment or transfer, without
the approval, consent or waiver of a third party thereto, would constitute a
material breach or other contravention of such Assigned Contract or in any way
materially adversely affect the rights of Purchaser, Seller or any of Seller's
Affiliates thereunder. If such approval, consent or waiver is not obtained, or
if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof would be ineffective such that
Purchaser would not in fact receive all such rights, Purchaser and Seller will
cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement, subject to any consent required
from the customer under such Assigned Contract, pursuant to which Purchaser
would 

obtain the benefits and perform and discharge the obligations thereunder in
accordance with this Agreement, or under which Seller or its applicable
Affiliates would enforce for the benefit of Purchaser at Purchaser's sole cost
and expense, with Purchaser being responsible for the performance and
discharge of Seller's or its Affiliates' Liabilities related thereto, any and
all rights of Seller or its Affiliates against a third party.

(ii) From the Effective Date until the 12-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, Seller and Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
at Closing or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter any and all Approved
Consents with Satisfactory Terms; provided that Seller will not be required to
incur any out of pocket costs or any other obligation or liability unless de
minimis or customary in nature.

(iii) If the Parties are unable to obtain an assignment of an Assigned
Contract with Satisfactory Terms, then the Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an Approved Consent. For the avoidance of doubt,
(1) failure to obtain any Approved Consent or (2) obtaining Approved Consent
but without Satisfactory Terms will in no way, in and of itself, be deemed a
breach of this Agreement or create any Liability under this Agreement for the
Seller or Canadian Seller.

(iv) If Seller is unable to assign any Assigned Contract prior to the Closing,
until the earlier of (A) such time as such Assigned Contract shall be deemed a
Transitioned Assigned Contract, (B) such time as such Assigned Contract
expires in accordance with its terms and (C) the 12‑month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Purchaser the same economic and other benefits that Purchaser would have
received if such Contract had been a Transitioned Assigned Contract as of the
Closing Date and Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform
and discharge the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement.
Failure to provide Purchaser with the same economic benefit or other benefits
that Purchaser would have received if such Contract had been a Transitioned
Assigned Contract shall in no way, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of
this Agreement or create any Liability under this Agreement for the Seller or
Canadian Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) any Assigned Contract which,
by its terms, renews automatically shall not be considered to have "expired"
for the purposes of subclause (B) above and (2) any Assigned Contract which,
by its terms, renews automatically subject to either party not providing
notice of termination prior to such automatic renewal date shall not be
considered to have "expired" for the purposes of subclause (B) above so long
as neither party has provided such notice. Any such Assigned Contract
referenced in clause (2) of the preceding sentence shall be considered to have
"expired" for the purposes of subclause (B) above (and any assignment of such
Assigned Contract shall be deemed not to have satisfied the Transition
Conditions as set forth in Section 1.05, if applicable) if 

any of Seller or its Affiliates that is party to such Assigned Contract has
given or received a notice of termination of such Assigned Contract from any
other party, and Seller hereby covenants that it and its Affiliates shall not
provide any such notice of termination under any Assigned Contracts from and
after the Effective Date without the prior written consent of Purchaser;
provided that if Purchaser enters into a new Contract or commercial
relationship with any party to an Assigned Contract terminated in accordance
with clause (2) of the preceding sentence within the 12-month period following
the Closing Date, such terminated Assigned Contract will be deemed to be a
Transition Assigned Contract (and the Transition Conditions with regard to
such Transitioned Assigned Contract will be deemed to have been satisfied, if
applicable) at the time Purchaser enters into such new Contract or commercial
relationship if such new Contract or commercial relationship includes
Satisfactory Terms.

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party nor
any of its Affiliates will be required to make any payments or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any
such approval, consent or waiver regarding the assignment of an Assigned
Contract (or to arrange a Replacement Contract) except (i) payments or
accommodations that are de minimis in nature or (ii) otherwise customary in
nature.

(c) The Parties agree and acknowledge that, except as set forth on Section
1.04(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Shared Contracts will be
assigned or transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliates. Prior to the Closing,
Seller will, at Purchaser's request, use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Purchaser to enter into a new Contract regarding the Business, with
respect to each such Shared Contract (each, a "Replacement Contract")
providing Purchaser with Satisfactory Terms.

(i) From the Closing Date, until the 12-month anniversary thereof, Purchaser
and Seller will each use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser
in entering into a Satisfactory Replacement Contract not previously entered
into as of the Closing for each Shared Contract.

(ii) If the Parties are unable to obtain a Satisfactory Replacement Contract
for any Shared Contract, then the Parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a Replacement Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, (1)
failure to obtain any Satisfactory Replacement Contract or (2) obtaining a
Replacement Contract that is not a Satisfactory Replacement Contract shall in
no way, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this Agreement or create any
Liability under this Agreement for the Seller or Canadian Seller.

(iii) If Purchaser is unable to enter into any Replacement Contract prior to
the Closing, until the earlier of (A) such time as such Replacement Contract
is entered into, (B) such time as such Shared Contract expires in accordance
with its terms and (C) the expiration of the services provided under the
Transition 

Services Agreement (the earliest of such date, the "Shared Contract End
Date"), Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser
with the same economic benefits that Purchaser would have received if such
Contract had been replaced with a Satisfactory Replacement Contract for
Purchaser as of the Closing Date and Purchaser will perform and discharge the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement. Failure to provide
Purchaser with the same economic benefit or other benefits that Purchaser
would have received if such Contract had been a Satisfactory Replacement
Contract shall in no way, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this
Agreement or create any Liability under this Agreement for the Seller or
Canadian Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, any (1) any Shared Contract
which, by its terms, renews automatically shall not be considered to have
"expired" for the purposes of subclause (B) above and (2) any Shared Contract
which, by its terms, renews automatically subject to either party not
providing notice of termination prior to such automatic renewal date shall not
be considered to have "expired" for the purposes of subclause (B) above so
long as neither party has provided such notice. Any such Shared Contract
referenced in clause (2) of the preceding sentence shall be considered to have
"expired" for the purposes of subclause (B) above (and any transition of such
Shared Contract shall be deemed not to have satisfied the Transition
Conditions as set forth in Section 1.05, if applicable) if any of Seller or
its Affiliates that is party to such Shared Contract has given or received a
notice of termination of such Shared Contract from any other party, and Seller
hereby covenants that it and its Affiliates shall not provide any such notice
of termination under any Shared Contracts from and after the Effective Date
without the prior written consent of Purchaser; provided that if Purchaser
enters into a new Contract or commercial relationship with any party to a
Shared Contract terminated in accordance with clause (2) of the preceding
sentence within the 12-month period following the Closing Date, such
terminated Shared Contract will be deemed to have been transitioned (and the
Transition Conditions with regard to such Shared Contract will be deemed to be
satisfied, if applicable) at the time Purchaser enters into such new Contract
or commercial relationship if such new Contract or commercial relationship
includes Satisfactory Terms.

Customer or Key Customer; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be
required to make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any such Approved Consent or
Evidence of Transitioned Shared Contract except payments or accommodations

any action the primary purpose of which is to avoid or lessen payment of any
CDPA Amount by Purchaser to Seller;(C) provide reasonable access (subject to
Seller's obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any such Confidential
Information) their respective properties, books, records (whether in hard copy
or computer format), Contracts, personnel and records relating to any the
parties efforts to obtain any Approved Consent or Evidence of Transitioned
Shared Contract from any Designated Customer or Key Customer, including to
determine if any Transition Conditions have been satisfied; provided, however,
that Purchaser's and its Affiliates' obligations pursuant to this clause (C)
shall terminate for each Key Customer for which the Transition Conditions have
been satisfied; and (D) obtain any Approved Consent or Evidence of
Transitioned Shared Contract from any Designated Customer or Key Customer as
soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, (1) failure to obtain any Approved Consent or Evidence of
Transitioned Shared Contract from any Designated Customer or Key Customer or
(2) obtaining an Approved Consent or Evidence of Transitioned Shared Contract
without Satisfactory Terms will in 

no way, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of this Agreement or create any
Liability under this Agreement for Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser.

(a) Final Working Capital Statement. Within 60 days after the Closing Time,
Purchaser will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a final working
capital statement (the "Final Working Capital Statement"), setting forth the
Net Working Capital as of the Closing Time (the "Final Working Capital"),
which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, any Special Working Capital
Item transferred in accordance with Section 1.07(f) and noting any discrepancy
between such Final Working Capital and the Estimated Net Working Capital set
forth in the Pre-Closing Statement pursuant to Section 1.05. The Final Working
Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent
consistent with GAAP, calculated on a basis consistent with the same
accounting principles, practices and methodologies and policies used in the
preparation of the Working Capital Statement, except, to the extent of any
exceptions set forth in the Working Capital Statement.

(b) Dispute; Final Determination. Within 30 days following receipt by Seller
of the Final Working Capital Statement, Seller will deliver written notice to
Purchaser of any dispute Seller has with respect to the preparation or content
of the Final Working Capital Statement (together with detailed supporting
documentation to support Seller's dispute in order to facilitate Purchaser's
review of any such item(s) in dispute); except that Seller may not dispute the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing
the Final Working Capital Statement if they are in accordance with GAAP and,
to the extent consistent with GAAP, calculated on a basis consistent 

with the same accounting principles, practices and methodologies and policies
used in the preparation of the Working Capital Statement. If Seller does not
notify Purchaser of a dispute with respect to the Final Working Capital
Statement within such 30‑day period, such Final Working Capital Statement will
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. In the event of such
notification of a dispute, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If the Parties, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to
resolve such dispute within 15 days after Seller advises Purchaser of its
objections, then the Parties jointly will engage Ernst and Young LLP (the
"Accounting Firm") to resolve such dispute solely in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than 15
days thereafter, the Parties will each prepare and submit a presentation
detailing each Party's complete statement of proposed resolution of the
dispute to the Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
more than 15 days thereafter, the Parties will cause the Accounting Firm to
determine an amount within the range of the respective amounts proposed by
each Party. The Parties will share the expenses of the Accounting Firm, with
such expenses being split in inverse proportion to the amount determined by
the Accounting Firm. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and may be enforced by a court of
competent venue and jurisdiction.

(c) Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section
1.07, each Party will cooperate with and make available to the other parties
and their respective Representatives all information, records, data and
working papers, and will permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may
be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Final Working Capital Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

(d) Downward Adjustment. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.07(b)) is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital,
then the Initial Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of
such shortfall, and Seller will pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash
equal to such shortfall to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller. Any such
payment is to be made within five Business Days of the date on which the Final
Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to Section 1.07(b).

(e) Upward Adjustment. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.07(b) is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital,
then the Initial Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such
excess, and Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to
such excess to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to
be made within five Business Days of the date on which the Final Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to Section 1.07(b).

(f) In the event any Special Working Capital Item is separated into its own
account that can be transferred to Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser at Closing,
such 

account will be transferred at Closing to Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser, as
applicable, and the Final Working Capital will take into account such
transfer.

Section 1.08. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Base Purchase Price (including
the Assumed Liabilities treated as consideration for the Purchased Assets for
Tax purposes) shall be allocated among (a) the stock of DESS, (b) the
Purchased Assets not located in Canada (other than stock of DESS), and (c) the
Purchased Assets located in Canada (the "Top-Line Allocation") pursuant to the
amounts set forth on Schedule 1.08. Within 60 days after Closing, Seller shall
prepare an allocation of the Base Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets
(other than stock of DESS) based on such Top-Line Allocation (the "Asset-Level
Allocation"), in accordance with Schedule 1.08 (the "Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule"), provided that Seller shall prepare a preliminary allocation among
the Purchased Assets located in Canada based on the Top-Line Allocation within
30 days after Closing, which shall be incorporated into the Asset-Level
Allocation prepared within 60 days after Closing. To the extent there are any
adjustments to the Base Purchase Price (including the adjustments contemplated
by Section 1.05 and Section 1.07), Purchaser and Seller will make appropriate
adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to reflect such changes.
Purchaser and Seller and each of their respective Affiliates will: (A) be
bound by the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as finally determined, for
purposes of determining any Taxes; (B) prepare and file, and cause their
respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns (including IRS
Form 8594) on a basis consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule,
as finally determined; and (C) cooperate in the filing of any forms (including
IRS Form 8594) required to be filed with regard to the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, as finally determined, including any amendments to such
forms required pursuant to any applicable Law or this Agreement. If the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the
Party receiving notice of the dispute will promptly notify the other Party,
and the Parties agree (and will cause their respective Affiliates) to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule in any Tax Proceeding. 

Section 1.09. Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article
1, to the extent required by the Code or applicable Law, Purchaser shall be
permitted to deduct and withhold any required amounts from the Initial
Purchase Price. Any amounts so deducted or withheld shall be treated as if
paid to the Party for whom the deduction or withholding was required. If
Purchaser determines that any deduction or withholding is required in respect
of a payment pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide notice to Seller at least 10 Business Days prior
to the date on which such payment is to be made, with a written explanation
substantiating the requirement to withhold; provided, however, that if Seller
fails to deliver the certification contemplated by Section 7.08, then
Purchaser shall not be required to provide any such notice or written
explanation with respect to amounts required to be withheld pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code as a result of such failure. Purchaser shall promptly
remit all withheld amounts to the applicable Taxing Authority in accordance
with applicable Law.

ARTICLE 2

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the applicable Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as

Section 2.01. Organization. Each of Seller, Canadian Seller, and DESS is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own its properties and to carry on the Business as presently
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where
such concept exists) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes
such qualification necessary, except (in the case of Seller and Canadian
Seller only) to the extent such failure would not prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 2.02. Authority; Enforceability. Seller and Canadian Seller each have
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (taken together, the "Transaction
Agreements") to which each is a party, to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the transactions and obligations relating to Assigned
Contracts and Shared Contracts as set forth in Section 1.04 and as otherwise
described herein (the "Transactions"). The execution, delivery and performance
by each of Seller and Canadian Seller of the Transaction Agreements to which
it is specified to be a party and the consummation by Seller and Canadian
Seller of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Seller or Canadian Seller, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Seller and/or Canadian Seller are
necessary pursuant to its respective governing documents or the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization to authorize the Transaction Agreements to which
it is specified to be a party or to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and Canadian Seller,
and each Ancillary Agreement to which Seller or Canadian 

Seller is specified to be a party will be duly executed and delivered by
Seller or Canadian Seller, as the case may be, and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties to the Transaction
Agreements, constitutes or will constitute a legal, valid and binding
agreement of Seller or Canadian Seller enforceable against Seller or Canadian
Seller, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms, subject to the
effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and general equitable principles, whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law (collectively, the "General Enforceability Exceptions").

Section 2.03. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of the Transaction Agreements to which it is specified to be a party
does not and will not (a) conflict with or violate Seller's, Canadian
Seller's, or DESS' organizational or governing documents, (b) assuming that
all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by Section 2.04 have
been obtained and all filings described therein have been made, conflict with

of any intercompany transactions or intercompany accounts (including, excess
loss accounts) made or existing on or before the Closing Date.

(d) DESS will not be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any

including those related to the Export Controls and clearances from DSS under
FOCI requirements, as applicable, necessary to conduct the Business as
presently conducted (collectively, the "Permits"), except those Permits the
failure of which to possess would not reasonably be expected to have,

have filed or caused to be filed all reports, notifications and filings with,
and have paid all regulatory fees to, the applicable Governmental Authority
necessary to maintain all of the Permits in full force and effect.

Affiliates shall be solely liable.

restrict the ability of Seller to keep copies of any Confidential Information
after the Closing, including copies of any and all books and records relating
to the Business. If, after the Closing, Seller or any of its Representatives
are legally required to disclose any Confidential Information, if and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller will (A) promptly notify Purchaser
to permit Purchaser, at its expense, to seek a protective order or take other
appropriate action and (B) cooperate as reasonably requested by Purchaser in
Purchaser's efforts to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information,
but only at Purchaser's sole cost and expense. If, after the Closing and in
the absence of a protective order, Seller or any of its Representatives are
compelled as a matter of Law to disclose Confidential Information to a third
party, Seller and its Representatives may disclose to the third party
compelling disclosure only the part of such Confidential Information as is
required by Law to be disclosed; except that, prior to any such disclosure,
Seller and its Representatives will use good faith efforts to advise and
consult with Purchaser and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature
and wording of such disclosure, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(j) After the Closing, except in connection with providing services to
Purchaser and its Affiliates under the Transition Services Agreement, Seller
and its Affiliates will not use, and will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to use, for any purpose,
any Confidential Information related exclusively to the Business, including
trade secrets and proprietary know-how, technology or processes (the
"Exclusive Confidential Information"), and will not use, and will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives not
to use, Confidential Information related primarily to the Business other than
in connection with other lines of business of Seller and its Affiliates in
existence on the Effective Date. Seller and its Affiliates will not copy, and
will cause their respective Representatives not to copy, any documents,
records, files, media or other resources containing any Exclusive Confidential
Information.

(k) Other than with respect to Tax matters, after the Closing, Seller will
afford to Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access (with an
opportunity to make copies) (subject to Purchaser's obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of any such Confidential Information) during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to Seller's properties, financial records
(whether in hard copy or computer format), workpapers, Contracts, Tax Returns
and personnel to the extent relating in each case to the Business or the
Purchased Assets as Purchaser will reasonably request for any reasonable
business purpose relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets; except that
any such access by Purchaser will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the businesses of Seller. Purchaser will bear all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with
the foregoing.

(l) From the Effective Date until the Closing, upon Seller's Knowledge, Seller
will use its good faith efforts to notify Purchaser of any fact or condition 

developing after the Effective Date that might have constituted a breach of
any representation or warranty in Article 2 if such representation or warranty
were made on the date of the occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.02(e) shall
affect the Parties' rights and obligations under this Agreement.

(m) From the Effective Date until the Closing, Seller will promptly consult
with Purchaser prior to modifying or amending in any material respect, or
terminating, releasing, assigning or waiving any material rights or material
claims under, any Contract with any customer on the Top Customer List, or
otherwise materially changing the business relationship with any customer on
the Top Customer List.

(n) From the Effective Date until the Closing, Seller will provide Purchaser
with copies of the monthly business review relating to the Business, including
a profit and loss statement, in a form and at such times consistent with the
past practice of the Business and as provided to Seller.

Section 4.03. Assistance in Transfer of Permits. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining (whether by transfer to
Purchaser, by new issuance by a Governmental Authority to Purchaser, or
otherwise) any Permits used primarily in connection with the operation of the
Business, including directing its Employees to cooperate with such efforts and
making any notifications required to be sent by Seller prior to the Closing,
including Permits related to the Export Controls. Purchaser will be
responsible for any expenses associated with the matters addressed in this
Section 4.03, and Seller will not have any Liability for the failure to obtain
the transfer of any such Permit or for Purchaser's failure to obtain a new
issuance of any such Permit.

Section 4.04. Third-Party Consents. Without limiting the effect of Section
6.01, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers (collectively, the
"Consents"), and give all notices to each third party under all applicable
Contracts that may be necessary for the consummation of the Transactions,
including the assignment and transition of the Contracts to Purchaser; it
being understood that obtaining any such Consents or giving of such notices is
not a condition to the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement,
including the obligation to effect the Closing, and that, in connection with
obtaining any such authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers, or giving
of such notices, Seller will not be required to incur any out of pocket costs
or any other obligation or liability except (i) payments or other obligations
that are de minimis in nature or (ii) otherwise customary in nature. 

Section 4.05. Solicitation of Employees. Seller will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, until the end of the three-year period immediately
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
(a) solicit any Employee to leave his or her employment with Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates or (b) hire or otherwise engage (1) any individual who is an
employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with whom Seller has had
contact during the course of pursuing the Transactions or (2) any Employee;
provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates will not be precluded from
soliciting, hiring or otherwise engaging any person (other than any individual
who is or was a Key Employee at any time on or after the Effective Date) (i)
who responds to any general solicitation or advertisement (including any non-
focused recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency, provided that
Seller or its Affiliates has not directed such recruitment efforts at such
person); (ii) who contacts Seller or any of its Affiliates on his or her own
initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation or encouragement from
Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than any general solicitation or
advertisement; (iii) whose employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
has been terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or (iv) with whom
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has had any contact in connection
with pursuing the Transactions.

Section 4.06. Hiring of Foreign Employees. Seller will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, until the end of the three-year period immediately
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
solicit any employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates who (a) is
primarily located in the Foreign Territory and (b) is known by Seller to be
engaged in Purchaser's or any of its Affiliates' provision of electronic
security products or services, including cameras, video surveillance
equipment, intrusion alarms, fire alarms, access control systems and/or alarm
monitoring, to leave his or her employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates; provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates will not be
precluded from placing any general solicitation or advertisement (including
any non-focused recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency,
provided that Seller or its Affiliates has not directed such recruitment
efforts at any such employee(s)).

Section 4.07. DSS. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date (or such
other time as the Parties may mutually agree), Seller, in consultation with
Purchaser, will prepare and submit to DSS a notification under NISPOM as may
be required in connection with the Transactions. Seller and Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and take all commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid DSS from taking any adverse action in connection
with the security clearances of employees of Seller or its Affiliates engaged
in the Business or the facilities where they work. 

Section 4.08. Waiver of Key Employee Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Obligations to Seller. Seller and Canadian Seller represent and acknowledge
that certain Employees (the "Restricted Employees") are subject to certain
covenants contained in their respective written agreements with Seller or
Canadian Seller restricting the activities of such Restricted Employees,
including those with respect to: (i) confidentiality, (ii) non-competition,
(iii) exclusivity, (iv) client non-solicitation and non-servicing, (v)
employee non-solicitation and non-hiring covenants and (vi) similar
restrictive covenants (collectively, the "Restrictive Covenants"), including
those that were entered into in connection with the employment of any such
individual with Seller or Canadian Seller. Seller and Canadian Seller
acknowledge and agree that on and after the Closing Date: (a) Purchaser and
its Affiliates may employ any and all of the Restricted Employees; (b) certain
Restricted Employees will be employed by Purchaser following the Closing and
no Restrictive Covenants shall limit such Restricted Employees from performing
services to, or on behalf of, Purchaser or its Affiliates, including providing
service to and soliciting of past, current and prospective clients of Seller,
Canadian Seller, or DESS, to the extent such services were previously
performed by such Restricted Employee in connection with the Business; and (c)
the Restricted Employees shall be released from all Restrictive Covenants to
the extent any Restrictive Covenants otherwise limit in any respect any
Restricted Employee in his or her employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates.

ARTICLE 5 
Covenants of Purchaser

Section 5.01. Confidentiality. Prior to the Closing and following any
termination of this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates will hold, and
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence, all Confidential Information (which
term, for purposes of this Section 5.01, will be deemed to include all
information that Seller has furnished to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the Transactions), except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (a) in the public domain, (b) lawfully acquired by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from sources other than
Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives; or (c) independently developed by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without access to the Confidential
Information; except that Purchaser may disclose Confidential Information to
its Representatives in connection with the Transactions so long as such
Representatives are informed by Purchaser of the nature of the Confidential
Information and are directed by Purchaser to hold such in confidence, and
Purchaser will be responsible for any breach of the confidentiality provisions
of this Section 5.01 by its Affiliates and Representatives. The obligation of
Purchaser and its Affiliates to hold the Confidential Information in
confidence prior to the Closing and after any termination of this Agreement
will be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to Confidential
Information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own
similar information in the ordinary course of business. If this Agreement is
terminated, Purchaser and its Affiliates will, and will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, destroy or
deliver to Seller, upon request, all Confidential Information and related
materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or 

Representatives or on behalf of any of the foregoing from Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement; provided,
however, that outside counsel to Purchaser shall be entitled to retain one
copy of all such documents and other materials to be used solely in connection
with such outside counsel's legal representation of Purchaser. If, prior to
the Closing or after any termination of this Agreement, Purchaser or any of
its Representatives are legally required to disclose any Confidential
Information, Purchaser will (i) promptly notify Seller to permit Seller, at
its expense, to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action and
(ii) except as otherwise required by applicable Law, cooperate as reasonably
requested by Seller in Seller's efforts to obtain a protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information, but only at Seller's sole cost and expense. If,
prior to the Closing or after any termination of this Agreement, in the
absence of a protective order, Purchaser or any of its Representatives is
compelled as a matter of Law to disclose Confidential Information to a third
party, Purchaser and its Representatives may disclose to the third party
compelling disclosure only the part of such Confidential Information as is
required by Law to be disclosed; except that, prior to any such disclosure,
Purchaser and its Representatives will use good faith efforts to advise and
consult with Seller and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and
wording of such disclosure. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 5.01 imposes any confidentiality restrictions upon Purchaser or its
Affiliates on or after the Closing with respect to any information relating to
the Business or the Purchased Assets.

Section 5.02. Access. Other than with respect to Tax matters, after the
Closing, Purchaser and DESS will afford promptly to Seller and its
Representatives reasonable access (with an opportunity to make copies)
(subject to Seller's obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any such
Confidential Information) during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to Purchaser's and DESS' properties, books, records (whether in hard
copy or computer format), workpapers, Contracts, personnel and records
relating to the Purchased Assets as Seller will reasonably request for any
reasonable business purpose relating to Seller's prior interests in the
Facilities or the Purchased Assets; except that any such access by Seller will
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Business by Purchaser or
DESS. Seller will bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries
and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing.

Section 5.03. Contractual Overpayments. If, at any time following the Closing,
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives a refund amount or a reduction in
an amount payable from a vendor that relates to a contractual overpayment
under any of the Assigned Contracts by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the
Closing, Purchaser will promptly pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount
of such refund or reduction. 

Section 5.04. Contacts with Customers, Suppliers, Employees, etc. Except as
set forth in Section 5.04 of the Disclosure Schedule, from the Effective Date
until the Closing, Purchaser (and all of its Affiliates and Representatives)
will not contact and communicate with the employees, consultants, customers,
suppliers and distributors of Seller, DESS and the Business in connection with
the Transactions without Seller's prior written consent.

Section 5.05. Solicitation of Employees. Except as explicitly set forth in
Article 8 or Section 5.05 of the Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser will not, and
will cause its Affiliates (including employees of the Business) not to, until
the end of the three-year period immediately following the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Seller, (a) solicit any individual who is
an employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the Effective Date to
leave his or her employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates or (b) hire
or otherwise engage any individual who is an employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates with whom Purchaser has had contact during the course of pursuing
the Transactions; provided, however, that Purchaser and its Affiliates will
not be precluded from soliciting, hiring or otherwise engaging any person (i)
who responds to any general solicitation or advertisement (including any non-
focused recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency, provided that
Purchaser or its Affiliates has not directed such recruitment efforts at such
person); (ii) who contacts Purchaser or its Affiliates on his or her own
initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation or encouragement from
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other than any general solicitation or
advertisement; (iii) whose employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates has
been terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates; or (iv) with whom neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has had any contact in connection with
pursuing the Transactions.

Section 5.06. Hiring of Foreign Employees. Purchaser will not, and will cause
its Affiliates not to, until the end of the three-year period immediately
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller,
solicit any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates who (a) is primarily
located in the Foreign Territory and (b) is known by Purchaser to be engaged
in Seller's or any of its Affiliates' provision of electronic security
products and/or services, including cameras, video surveillance equipment,
intrusion alarms, fire alarms, access control systems and/or alarm monitoring,
to leave his or her employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided,
however, that Purchaser and its Affiliates will not be precluded from placing
any general solicitation or advertisement (including any non-focused
recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency, provided that
Purchaser or its Affiliates has not directed such recruitment efforts at any
such employee(s)). 

ARTICLE 6 
Covenants of Purchaser and Seller

Section 6.01. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.

(g) Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate
with the other Party to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary or
desirable under applicable Law to consummate, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions. Following the Closing and the consummation of
the Transactions, Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates
each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to execute such documents and
other papers and take or cause to be taken such further action as may
reasonably be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements and to fully effectuate the Transactions. Seller
and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and cause their
Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts, to transfer to Purchaser
and its Affiliates in connection with the Closing the performance bonds and
other instruments listed on Section 6.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule or
otherwise cooperate to assist Purchaser and its Affiliates in obtaining
replacement performance bonds and other instruments in place of such
performance bonds and other instruments that are not transferred.

(h) Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) prepare, as
soon as practicable, all filings and other presentations necessary or
desirable to obtain the HSR Clearance or any other consent, approval or other
authorization from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
Transactions; (ii) prosecute such filings and other presentations with
diligence; (iii) oppose any objections to, appeals from or petitions to
reconsider or reopen any such authorization by Persons not party to this
Agreement; (iv) facilitate obtaining any final order or orders approving the
Transactions; and (v) furnish all information requested by any Governmental
Authority in connection with any approvals of or filings with any Governmental
Authority and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information in
connection with any such requirements imposed upon Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates by any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.
Subject to Section 6.02, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the HSR Clearance to allow the consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as possible. Seller will not have any Liability for the failure to
obtain the HSR Clearance or other consent, approval or other authorization in
connection with the Transactions. Each Party will advise the other Party
promptly of any material communication received by such Party or any of its
Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any state
attorney general or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the
Transactions and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) such Party proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade
Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Except as required
by Law, neither Seller nor Purchaser will independently participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any findings or inquiry
in 

connection with the Transactions without giving the other prior notice of the
meeting and outside counsel for each Party the opportunity to attend,
participate, or both, in each case unless prohibited by the Governmental
Authority. The Parties shall work cooperatively together on all communications
and strategy relating to HSR Clearance to the extent permitted by applicable
Law in connection with any information or proposals submitted under or
relating to the HSR Act in connection with the Transaction. A Party shall not
be required to share any information with any other Party that the disclosing
Party deems competitively sensitive or likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Business or a material adverse effect on any business of such
Party or any of its Affiliates, provided that the Parties act in good faith;
provided, however, that each Party shall provide notice to the other of the
fact that it is withholding such information; provided, further, the foregoing
shall not limit each Party's obligations under this Section 6.01(b) to furnish
information to any Governmental Authority, nor to limit Seller's obligations
under this Agreement to provide information to Purchaser about the Business.
In the event that a Party is required to furnish privileged or competitive
information pursuant to Section 6.01, the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided to the other Party or
provided on an outside counsel-only basis in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to result in any waiver or loss of privilege (including
by entering into a common interest or joint defense agreement).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Purchaser or its Affiliates to provide information
about their business to Seller.

(i) The Parties will consult and cooperate with one another to the extent
permitted by Law in connection with the CFIUS filing to be made in connection
with the Transactions, including: (i) engaging in pre-filing discussions with
CFIUS or its member agencies, as deemed advisable by the parties; (ii)
promptly preparing the CFIUS notice and making any draft and final filings
required or deemed advisable in connection with the CFIUS review process; and
(iii) providing, within the time period imposed by CFIUS, any information
reasonably requested by CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS review or
investigation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Purchaser agrees to accept and implement any and all mitigation measures
imposed by CFIUS as a condition of obtaining CFIUS clearance.

Section 6.02. HSR Clearance.

(j) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions set forth in
Section 6.01, each Party will make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days after the
Effective Date, and make any other required submissions with respect to the
Transactions under the HSR Act.

(k) Each Party will take all other appropriate actions reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the HSR Clearance. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates will not commit
to any divestitures of assets or businesses, but will commit to any licenses,
hold-separate or 

similar agreements with respect to assets, or agreements with respect to
conduct of business as a condition to obtaining the HSR Clearance, so long as
the duration of any such licenses, hold-separate or similar agreements with
respect to assets, or agreements with respect to conduct of business is no
longer than a period of two years from the Closing Date; provided, that
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to offer or agree to any
such commitment with any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have an adverse material effect on
the Business, on any other business of Purchaser and its Affiliates or on the
Business and such other businesses on a combined basis.

Section 6.03. Certain Filings. The Parties will cooperate with one another to
the extent permitted by Law (a) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any
actions, agreements, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any Assigned Contracts or Shared Contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and (b) in taking such
actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions,
agreements, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 6.04. Public Announcements. From the Effective Date through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
will be issued by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
without the prior consent of Seller (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and no public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions will be issued by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives without the prior consent of Purchaser (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except in each case as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules, regulations or policies of
any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement will allow the other Party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; except that Seller may make internal announcements regarding the
Transactions to its employees after reasonable prior notice to, and
consultation with, Purchaser.

Section 6.05. Trademarks; Trade Names.

(f) With respect to any Leased Facility, Purchaser will either (i) remove all
interior and exterior signage with respect to such Leased Facility bearing the
"Diebold" name, trade name or trademark, or any other trademark retained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than DESS), and any other similar,
derivative or translation of the trade names or trademarks (exclusive of any
such trade names or trademarks validly transferred as Purchased Assets)
(collectively, the "Retained Diebold Trade Names and Trademarks") or (ii)
cover such signage with temporary signage or other opaque materials not
bearing any Retained Diebold Trade Names and Trademarks so that no part of the
underlying signage is visible, in either case no later than 12 months after
the Closing. 

(g) Purchaser and its Affiliates will have the right to (i) sell existing
inventory and (ii) use existing packaging, labeling, containers, stationery,
business forms, supplies, advertising and promotional materials and any
similar materials bearing the Retained Diebold Trade Names and Trademarks for
12 months following the Closing; except that (A) neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates will take any action that could materially impair the value of
the Retained Diebold Trade Names and Trademarks; (B) when using the items
listed in clause (ii) above in the context of entering into or conducting
contractual relationships, Purchaser will make clear to all other applicable
parties that Purchaser or DESS (subject to Section 6.05(c)), rather than
Seller or any of its Affiliates, is the party entering into or conducting the
contractual relationship; and (C) personnel of Purchaser or its Affiliates
using the above items will not, and will have no authority to, hold themselves
out as officers, employees or agents of Seller or any of its Affiliates.
Purchaser and its Affiliates will comply with all applicable Laws in any use
of packaging or labeling containing the Retained Diebold Trade Names and
Trademarks.

(h) Before the Closing, Seller and DESS may execute and file all documents as
will be necessary or desirable to change the name of DESS to remove the word
"Diebold" or any derivation or translation thereof from such name; provided;
however, Seller shall obtain Purchaser's consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the changed name before filing any documents to change the name
of DESS. To the extent not already changed by Seller or DESS, as promptly as
practicable after the Closing but in no event later than 20 Business Days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser will, and will cause DESS to, at Purchaser's
sole cost and expense, change the name of DESS to remove the word "Diebold" or
any derivation or translation thereof, including filings with the applicable
Governmental Authority of each jurisdiction in which the ownership or
operation of DESS' assets or the character of its activities is such as to
require it to be licensed or qualified in such jurisdiction.

(i) With respect to Section 6.05(b), Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize its use of the Retained Diebold Trade Names and
Trademarks, and, in any event, will cease using the Retained Diebold Trade
Names and Trademarks on fixed assets as soon as practicable and in any event
within 12 months after the Closing. 

Section 6.06. Notices of Certain Events. From the Effective Date until the
Closing Date, each Party will promptly notify the other Party of:

(h) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(i) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions; and

(j) any change or fact of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely
to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 9 become incapable of
being satisfied.

Section 6.07. Wrong Pocket. If any Party receives any payment after the
Closing for any product or service sold by or on behalf of the other Parties
or in satisfaction of any receivable or similar obligation that is a Purchased
Asset (in the case of Seller) or Excluded Asset (in the case of Purchaser),
then such Party will promptly remit such funds to the appropriate other Party.
Nothing in this Section 6.07 will impose any duty or obligation of any of the
Parties to collect any payments or amounts for the other Parties.

Section 6.08. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

(i) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will directly or indirectly,
during the three-year period commencing on the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), engage in the business of providing electronic security products
(including cameras) and/or services, video surveillance equipment, intrusion
alarms, fire alarms, access control systems and/or alarm monitoring, in the
United States and Canada (the "Restricted Business"); provided that electronic
security products and services (including cameras) related to or incorporated
into Seller's and its Affiliates' financial self service product and services,
including automatic teller machines will not be deemed to be, and are not part
of, the Restricted Business. For purposes of this Section 6.08(a), Wincor
shall be deemed an Affiliate of Seller from and after the closing of any
proposed transaction between Wincor and Seller.

(j) Without in any way limiting the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, during the Restricted Period, solicit
any Restricted Customer (as defined below) to market, sell, or provide
services or products relating to the Restricted Business. For purposes of this
Section 6.08, a "Restricted Customer" means any (i) customer with whom Seller
or its Affiliates conducted business related to the Business in the two years
prior to the Closing Date or (ii) prospective customer with whom Seller or its
Affiliates had direct contact in an effort to market, sell, or provide
services relating to the Business or to whom Seller or any of its Affiliates
submitted bids or proposals related to the Business in the six months prior to
the Closing Date.

(k) During the Restricted Period, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
will, directly or indirectly, partner, joint venture, coordinate, or cooperate
with, or otherwise 

help, direct, facilitate, assist or support any Person engaging in the
activities in which Seller and its Affiliates are prohibited from engaging
under this Section 6.08.

(l) If any court determines that any of the provisions of this Section 6.08 is
excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under
applicable Law, it is the intention of the Parties that such restriction may
be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted by the Laws of that jurisdiction.

ARTICLE 7 
Tax Matters

Section 7.01. General. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
this Article 7 will govern Tax matters.

Section 7.02. Seller Prepared Tax Returns. Seller will prepare or cause to be
prepared all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the Purchased
Assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Closing DESS Returns) for
all (a) Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date and (b) Straddle
Periods (collectively, "Seller Prepared Tax Returns"). All income Tax Returns
of DESS required to be filed by Seller pursuant to this Section 7.02 ("Pre-
Closing DESS Returns") will be filed in a manner consistent with prior
practices, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller shall deliver a
draft of any such Pre-Closing DESS Returns to Purchaser for its review,
comment and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) not less than 30 days prior to the date on which such
Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking into account any applicable
extensions). The Parties agree to consult and timely resolve in good faith any
issue arising as a result of Purchaser's review of such Pre-Closing DESS
Returns. In the event that Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve an issue
on any Pre-Closing DESS Return, Seller and Purchaser shall refer such dispute
to the Accounting Firm for final determination (with the Accounting Firm's
determination to be limited to only the disputed items in such Pre-Closing
DESS Return), the costs of which shall be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller agree to file any such Pre-Closing DESS Return
(or to amend any such Pre-Closing DESS Return that was required to be filed
during the period the Accounting Firm was making its determination) consistent
with the Accounting Firm's determinations as to the disputed items. Seller
will timely file or cause to be timely filed all Seller Prepared Tax Returns.
Seller will timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes due with respect
to such Seller Prepared Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to
the extent that such Taxes are not taken into account in determining the Base
Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser will promptly
pay, or cause to be promptly paid, to Seller the amount of such Tax for which
Purchaser is responsible pursuant to this Agreement for any such Seller
Prepared Tax Return. Seller shall not make an election under Section 336(e) of
the Code with respect to the Transactions. 

Section 7.03. Tax Cooperation. Purchaser and Seller will furnish to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including access
to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
Tax Proceeding, and the prosecution or defense of any Action relating to any
Tax. The Party requesting any such information will bear all of the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees, but excluding
reimbursement for salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in
connection with providing such information. Except with respect to information
that is generally available to the public, the Party requesting such
information will (a) hold all such information in the strictest confidence,
except as required by applicable Law or which must be disclosed in connection
with any Tax Proceeding or Taxing Authority inquiry, (b) disseminate such
information only to its officers, directors, employees and representatives who
have been advised of the confidential nature of such information, and only on
an as-needed basis, (c) return promptly, upon request of the other Party, all
copies of the information received by it and (d) take all steps necessary to
cause its officers, directors, employees and representatives to comply with
the terms and conditions of this Section 7.03. Purchaser and Seller will
retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased
Assets for a period of seven years following the Closing. Purchaser and Seller
will cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Proceeding involving
the Purchased Assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, DESS) or the
Business, including providing the other Party timely written notice of any
inquiries or Tax Proceedings by any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Assets for which Seller may have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to Article 11 (a "Tax Claim"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser will not have access to any books,
records, Tax Returns or other information of Seller or any of its Affiliates,
or any portions thereof, that do not relate primarily to the Purchased Assets
or the Business.

Section 7.04. Apportionment. For purposes of this Agreement, any Taxes
relating to the Purchased Assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, DESS)
with respect to any Straddle Period will be apportioned between the portion of
such period up to and including the Closing Date (such portion, a "Pre-Closing
Straddle Period") and the portion of such period that begins after the Closing
Date (such portion, a "Post-Closing Straddle Period") based, (a) in the case
of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, sales or
receipts, on a per diem basis and, (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income, sales or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Section 7.04, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item that is calculated on an annual basis will be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period in the same manner as that set forth in clause
(a) of this Section 7.04. Proration of Taxes that are undetermined as of the
Closing Date (i) will be based on the most recently available Tax rate and
valuation, giving effect to applicable exemptions, recently-voted millage,
change in valuation, and similar items, whether or not officially certified to
the appropriate Taxing Authority as of the Closing Date, (ii) will use a
365-day year and (iii) if any Tax proration is based upon an estimate at
Closing, a post-Closing adjustment will be made by cash settlement between 

Seller and Purchaser within 30 Business Days after receipt of the actual
expense invoices or Tax bill, which adjustment obligation will survive the
Closing.

Section 7.05. Tax Refunds. All refunds of Taxes received with respect to the
Purchased Assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, DESS) for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, net of reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred to obtain such
refunds, will be the property of Seller or Canadian Seller, as applicable. If
a Tax refund belonging to Seller or Canadian Seller is received by Purchaser
or Canadian Purchaser, then Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser will remit such
refund, net of reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred to obtain such
refund, to Seller or Canadian Seller within five Business Days of receipt by
Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser. Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims for refund of Seller,
Canadian Seller or DESS with respect to the other Purchased Assets that are
pending as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 7.05, the term
"refunds of Taxes" will include DESS' actual utilization in any Post-Closing
Tax Period of any Tax refund, overpayment, credit or exemption attributable to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that reduces or eliminates any Tax imposed with
respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period, and DESS' actual receipt or
utilization of any Tax refund, overpayment, credit or exemption after the
Closing to the extent such refund, overpayment, credit or exemption is
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. If DESS is entitled to receive any
Tax refund described in this Section 7.05, Purchaser shall cause DESS to
elect, under applicable Law, to actually receive a payment of such refund and
will not elect to receive such Tax refund in the form of a credit against
future Taxes.

Section 7.06. Transfer Taxes. The Purchase Price is exclusive of any Transfer
Taxes. Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser, as applicable, shall promptly remit to
Seller or Canadian Seller, as applicable, all applicable Transfer Taxes with
respect to the transfer of the Purchased Assets. Seller and Canadian Seller,
as applicable, will timely file all Tax Returns with respect to all excise,
sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, filing, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, license, transfer, transaction privilege and similar Taxes,
levies, charges and fees incurred in connection with the Transactions,
including any interest, penalties or additions thereto (collectively, the
"Transfer Taxes"), to the extent required by applicable Law, and Seller or
Canadian Seller, as applicable, shall timely remit all Transfer Taxes owed,
whether or not reflected on a Tax Return, to the appropriate Taxing Authority.
Within thirty (30) days after payment by Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser,
Seller or Canadian Seller will provide Purchaser or Canadian Purchaser with
evidence that all such Transfer Taxes have been remitted to the appropriate
Taxing Authority. Purchaser and Seller, and Canadian Purchaser and Canadian
Seller, will reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate Transfer Taxes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. Purchaser and Seller, and Canadian
Purchaser and Canadian Seller, will cooperate with each other in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes. Purchaser will
provide Seller, and Canadian Purchaser will provide Canadian Seller, with any
valid resale certificate, exemption certificate, and other documentation
required to qualify for any exemption from the collection or payment of
Transfer Taxes requested by Seller at the Closing. 

Section 7.07. Amendment of Tax Returns. Except as required pursuant to
applicable Law or as a result of the resolution of a Tax Claim, Purchaser will
not file, amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax election or Tax
Return with respect to the Purchased Assets (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, DESS) that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 7.08. FIRPTA Certificate. On the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to
Purchaser an executed affidavit of non-foreign status that reasonably complies
with Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

Section 7.09. Tax Sharing and Allocation Agreements. All agreements that
primarily relate to the allocation, sharing or reimbursement of Taxes with
respect to any of Seller, Canadian Seller and DESS (in the case of Seller and
Canadian Seller, only to the extent related to the Purchased Assets or
Business) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser and DESS shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

Section 7.10. Section 22 Election. Canadian Purchaser and Canadian Seller
agree to file an election with respect to the Accounts Receivable under
Section 22 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), and the corresponding sections of
any provincial statute and any regulations under such statutes, in a manner
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule prepared in accordance
with Section 1.08.

Section 7.11. Protective Election. At the election of Purchaser following the
Closing, Seller shall make a timely election (taking into account any payments
treated as post-closing adjustments to amounts paid for the stock of DESS)
under Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes (and any comparable provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law) to reduce the Tax basis in the stock of DESS in an amount sufficient
to avoid any reduction in the aggregate of the Tax attributes, including the
Tax basis of the assets and deferred deductions pursuant to Treasury
Regulation section 1.1502-36(d). Such election shall be made in accordance
with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-36(e)(5), and
Seller shall provide reasonable supporting documentation to Purchaser of the
amount of Tax basis subject to reduction pursuant to the election, including
documentation supporting Seller's Tax basis in the stock of DESS immediately
prior to the Closing and the net inside attribute amounts (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-36(d)(3)) of DESS. 

Section 7.12. Subsection 20(24) Election. If applicable, Canadian Purchaser
and Canadian Seller will jointly execute and file an election under subsection
20(24) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in the manner required under the Income
Tax Act (Canada) and under the equivalent or corresponding provisions of any
other applicable provincial statue, in the prescribed form and within the time
period permitted under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and under any other
applicable provincial statute, as to such amount deemed paid by Seller to
Purchaser for the assumption of future obligations.

Section 7.13. GST/HST Election. If applicable, Canadian Purchaser and Canadian
Seller will jointly execute and Canadian Purchaser will file an election under
section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) in the prescribed manner and within
the prescribed time such that Canadian Purchaser will not be required to pay,
and Canadian Seller will not be required to collect, any Canadian goods and
service tax or harmonized sales tax with respect to the transfer of the
Canadian Assets. Notwithstanding such election, in the event it is determined
by the Canada Revenue Agency that there is a liability of Canadian Purchaser
to pay, or of Canadian Seller to collect and remit, goods and services tax or
harmonized sales tax on all or part of the Purchaser Assets in Canada, such
Taxes, including any applicable interest and penalties, shall be forthwith
paid by Canadian Purchaser to the Canada Revenue Agency, or to the Canadian
Seller for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authority, as the case
may be.

Section 7.14. Restrictive Covenant Election. Canadian Purchaser and Canadian
Seller will jointly elect in accordance with subsection 56.4(13) of the Income
Tax Act (Canada) to have the provisions of subsection 56.4 (7) of the Income
Tax Act (Canada) apply to the restrictive covenant granted by the Canadian
Seller to the Canadian Purchaser under Section 6.08, such election to be
prepared by Canadian Purchaser and Canadian Seller, and duly filed by the
Canadian Seller in the prescribed form (or, if upon Closing there is no
prescribed form, in a form acceptable to the Canada Revenue Agency) together
with a copy of the restrictive covenant as required by subsection 56.4(13) of
the Income Tax Act (Canada).

ARTICLE 8 
Employees And Employee Benefits

Section 8.01. Employees and Offers of Employment.

(m) Purchaser shall offer employment to all Employees, subject to the
following terms and conditions:

(i) For each Employee employed by DESS, Purchaser shall communicate within 30
days after the Effective Date an offer of continued employment.

(ii) For each other Employee, Purchaser shall communicate within 60 days after
the Effective Date an offer of employment. 

(iii) For each Employee, other than an Inactive Employee or VISA Transfer
Employee, the commencement of employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates,
including continuation of employment of Employees employed by DESS, shall be
the Closing Date (the "Hire Date"). The Employees employed in the United
States described in clause (ii) who do not specifically decline Purchaser's
offer of employment will be deemed to have accepted such offer and will
commence such employment with Purchaser on the Hire Date. The Employees
employed in Canada described in clause (ii) who accept such offer will
commence such employment with Purchaser on the Hire Date (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not be a date prior to the Closing Date).

(iv) For each Inactive Employee, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
such individual shall continue employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates
and shall not have a Hire Date until he or she presents himself or herself to
Purchaser as ready and able to commence active employment with Purchaser and
accepts Purchaser's offer of employment, but only if such Inactive Employee
presents himself or herself for active employment not later than six (6)
months following the Closing Date. Where an Inactive Employee presents himself
or herself for active employment at a time greater than six (6) months
following the Closing Date, employment opportunities with Purchaser, if any,
shall be at the discretion of Purchaser and subject to any local reemployment
obligations.

(v) Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to transfer any
applicable local visa or similar authorization with respect to the Employees
identified on Section 8.01(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "VISA Transfer
Employee") in order to allow such VISA Transfer Employee to transfer to
employment with Purchaser on, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing
Date. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, if such transfer measures
are not completed as of the Closing Date, the VISA Transfer Employee shall
continue employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates and shall not have a
Hire Date until such transfer measures are completed. Purchaser shall assume
all Liability for transferring any applicable local visa or similar
authorization with respect to the VISA Transfer Employee.

Within the time frame specified in Section 8.01(a)(i) and (ii), Purchaser
shall communicate to each Employee the terms and conditions of employment
applicable upon the Hire Date, including position, location, compensation
opportunities and benefits. Purchaser will cause such communications to
include such other terms and conditions as Seller may request in order to
protect Seller from incurring any Liability under the WARN Act or analogous
Law or any Liability to Employees for notice, payment in lieu of notice,
termination pay or severance pay under statute, common law or otherwise. 

(n) Each Employee who commences employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates
pursuant to Section 8.01(a), including any Employee employed by DESS, is
referred to herein as a "Hired Employee." Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
shall have no obligation to continue the employment or retain the services of
any Hired Employee for any period of time following the applicable Hire Date,
and, except as otherwise provided by Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, Purchaser
shall be entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to any Hired
Employee and any other terms or conditions of employment with any Hired
Employee. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee of employment of, or contract between Purchaser and, any Hired
Employee.

(o) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall make a good faith effort to
provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, each Hired Employee (other than
any Senior Executive who has executed an employment agreement with Purchaser)
immediately following the Closing Date compensation and benefits (excluding
any value associated with Seller's employee stock purchase plan or any defined
benefit pension benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
as those provided by Seller and its Affiliates to such Hired Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

Section 8.02. Purchaser Benefit Plans.

(a) Seller and its Affiliates shall retain sponsorship of the Employee Benefit
Plans and shall retain all commitment, Liabilities and obligations thereunder,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing. Purchaser shall not assume
sponsorship of, contribute to or maintain, or be required to contribute to or
maintain, the Employee Benefit Plans and shall not assume any commitment,
Liability or obligation thereunder, whether arising before, on or after the
Closing.

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates will recognize all service of the Hired
Employees with Seller or any of its predecessors or Affiliates for purposes,
of vesting, eligibility to participate, vacation and sick time credit, and
benefit accrual under all plans and programs of Purchaser and its Affiliates
and for all purposes under applicable Law other than (i) for purposes of
accrual of benefits under any defined benefit plan or (ii) to the extent such
service crediting would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) Seller shall retain the Liability and responsibility for payment of all
medical, dental, health and disability Liabilities, obligations, losses and
claims under any applicable welfare benefit plans of Seller and its Affiliates
(the "Seller Welfare Plans") incurred by any Hired Employee (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any Hired Employee) prior to that Hired Employee's Hire
Date, and Purchaser shall not assume any Liability or responsibility with
respect to such Liabilities, obligations, losses or claims. Purchaser will
take all actions necessary so that, effective as of a Hired Employee's Hire
Date, the welfare benefit plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates (the
"Purchaser Welfare Plans") will provide welfare benefit plan coverage,
including group medical benefits, to the Hired Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any Hired Employee) who was 

covered under a corresponding Seller Welfare Plan prior to the Hire Date.
Purchaser shall have the Liability and responsibility for payment of all
Liabilities, obligations, losses and claims under any applicable Purchaser
Welfare Plan incurred by any Hired Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary
of any Hired Employee) on or after that Hired Employee's Hire Date, and Seller
shall not assume any Liability or responsibility with respect to such
Liabilities, obligations, losses or claims. Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any Purchaser Welfare Plan to (i) not include with
respect to any Hired Employee and his or her covered dependents any
restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions
or any actively at work requirements (except to the extent such restrictions
or limitations were applicable to such Hired Employee as of immediately prior
to the Hire Date under any Seller Welfare Plan), and (ii) take into account
any eligible expenses incurred by any Hired Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of such Seller Welfare Plan
ending on the date such Hired Employee's participation in such Purchaser
Welfare Plan begins for purposes of satisfying all deductibles, coinsurance
and out-of-pocket maximums applicable to such Hired Employee and his or her
eligible dependents for the same plan year under the Purchaser Welfare Plan as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Purchaser Welfare Plan.
For purposes of the foregoing, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred on the
date that the event that gives rise to the claim occurs (for purposes of life
insurance, sickness, accident and disability programs) or on the date that
treatment or services are provided (for purposes of health care programs).

(d) Seller shall be responsible for providing any Employee (and such
Employee's "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(g) of
the Code) whose "qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of
the Code, occurs on or prior to that Employee's Hire Date, including any
qualifying event occurring on the Hire Date as a direct result of the
consummation of the Transactions but excluding any qualifying event described
in Section 603(3) or 603(5) of ERISA unless such qualifying event was
disclosed to Seller prior to the Hire Date, with the continuation of group
health coverage required by Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B(f)
of the Code ("Continuation Coverage") under the terms of the health plan
maintained by Seller. Purchaser shall be responsible for Continuation Coverage
to any Hired Employee (and such Hired Employee's qualified beneficiaries) (1)
whose qualifying event occurs after that Hired Employee's Hire Date to the
extent required by Law or (2) whose qualifying event is described in Section
603(3) or 603(5) of ERISA and occurred on or prior to that Hired Employee's
Hire Date but for which Seller was not notified prior to the Hire Date.

(e) Purchaser shall make commercially reasonable efforts so that, effective as
of the Closing Date, (i) any non-highly compensated, as defined by the Code,
Hired Employees employed in the United States will be eligible to participate
in the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan sponsored by
Purchaser (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan"), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, and (ii) the Purchaser 401(k) Plan complies with
ERISA and the Code. Prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable),
Seller and Purchaser shall take any and all action as 

may be required, including, if necessary, amendments to the tax qualified
defined contribution plan of Seller in which Hired Employees participate (the
"Seller 401(k) Plan") and/or the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, to either (A) permit
each Hired Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
excluding loans) in cash to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to
the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance
distributable to such Hired Employee from the Seller 401(k) Plan; or (B) to
the extent mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to a separate,
written instrument, cause a trustee-to-trustee transfer from the Seller 401(k)
Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of the entire account balance of each Hired
Employee under the Seller 401(k) Plan, including any unvested balances and any
outstanding loans.

(f) Purchaser will take all actions necessary so that, effective as of his or
her respective Hire Date, any Hired Employee employed in Canada will be
eligible to participate in one or more defined contribution pension plans
sponsored by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

(g) Purchaser will, or will cause its Affiliates to, credit each Hired
Employee with the unused, accrued vacation, sick leave or personal days to
which the Hired Employee is entitled through the Closing Date; except that if
Seller or an Affiliate will be required by applicable Law to pay any Hired
Employee the cash value of his or her unused, accrued vacation, sick leave or
personal days described in this Section 8.02(g), then Purchaser or its
Affiliate will reimburse Seller or its Affiliate for the amount so paid by
Seller and will not be required to honor such vacation, sick leave or personal
days.

(h) If the Closing occurs in the last six months of the calendar year, Seller
will, or will cause its Affiliates to, pay to each participant in Seller's
Annual Incentive Plan who remains employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates
through the Closing Date, a pro-rated annual bonus for the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs in an amount equal to the product of (i) the annual
bonus earned by such participant under Seller's Annual Incentive Plan for such
year (assuming a full year of performance but measuring as of the Closing
Date) as determined by Seller in its discretion and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from January 1st of such
calendar year until the Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365 (the
"Prorated Bonus"). Seller will pay the Prorated Bonus to eligible Hired
Employees on or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date if such
accelerated payment will not be in violation of Section 409A of the Code, and
if such accelerated payment would be in violation of Section 409A of the Code,
Seller will pay the Prorated Bonus to eligible Hired Employees at a time
determined by Seller to be compliant with Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by Seller, Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates will pay the Prorated Bonus to eligible Hired Employees so long as
Seller transfers to Purchaser all amounts payable in respect of such Prorated
Bonus and the employer portion of any payroll Taxes attributable to such
Prorated Bonus. For the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser
will, or will cause its Affiliates to, provide each Hired Employee a bonus
opportunity that is no less than the bonus 

opportunity such Hired Employee had with Seller or its Affiliates for the
calendar year of the Closing; provided that if the Closing occurs in the last
six months of the calendar year, Purchaser may provide a bonus opportunity
that is prorated based on the number of days in the calendar year following
the Closing Date.

Section 8.03. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Article 8
will (a) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or
former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or
Purchaser or any other Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns, (b) constitute or create an employment agreement, or
(c) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Seller, Purchaser or their Affiliates.

received a certificate signed by an officer of Seller to the foregoing effect.

(k) Seller shall have provided all required notices to the Departments of
State and Defense pursuant to its obligations as a U.S. person engaged in

Party's failure to comply with its obligations to consummate the Transactions,

not be available to the Party seeking to terminate if any action of such Party
or the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Closing has been the

prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim
will have been given to Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.04 for such
indemnification, the Seller Indemnified Parties will continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided
in this Article 11.

(o) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
11.03 will be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from Purchaser to an account designated by the applicable Seller
Indemnified Party to Purchaser within 15 days after the final determination
thereof.

Section 11.04. Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(i) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article 11 in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a Party or Affiliate thereof)
against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnified party
must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of
the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by
such indemnified party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim, except that
failure to give such notification will not affect the indemnification provided
under this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party will have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party
will deliver to the indemnifying party, within ten Business Days after the
indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third-Party Claim. 

(j) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Upon
receipt of the notice described in Section 11.04(a), the indemnifying party
will have the right to defend the indemnified party against the Third-Party
Claim so long as (i) within 10 days after receipt of the notification under
Section 11.04(a), the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in
writing that the indemnifying party will defend the Third-Party Claim, (ii)
the indemnifying party is not a party to the Action or the indemnified party
has determined in good faith that there would be no conflict of interest or
other inappropriate matter associated with joint representation, (iii) the
Third-Party Claim does not involve, and is not likely to involve, any claim by
any Governmental Authority, (iv) the Third-Party Claim primarily involves a
claim for money damages, (v) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with
respect to, the Third-Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the
indemnified party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continuing business interests of the indemnified party, (vi)
the indemnifying party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively
and diligently, and (vii) the indemnifying party keeps the indemnified party
apprised of all developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the
Third-Party Claim and permits the Indemnified Party to participate in the
defense of the Third-Party Claim at the expense of the indemnified party.
Should the indemnifying party be entitled to and so elect to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party will not be liable to
the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, so long as the
conditions (ii) - (vii) in the preceding sentence continue to be true. If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party will have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that
the indemnifying party will control such defense. The indemnifying party will
be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified
party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the
defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third-Party
Claim, all the Parties will cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the use of
reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Whether or not the indemnifying party will have assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party will not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party may pay,
settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the
indemnified party, so long as such settlement includes (i) an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from all Liability in respect of such
Third‑Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the indemnified party to any
injunctive relief or 

other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not include a statement or admission of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(k) If any indemnified party desires to assert any claim for indemnification
provided for under this Article 11 other than a claim in respect of, arising
out of or involving a Third-Party Claim, such indemnified party will notify
the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into
account the information then available to such indemnified party), of such
claim promptly after becoming aware of the existence of such claim, except
that the failure of an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party will
relieve the indemnifying party from its obligation to indemnify only to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

Section 11.05. Other Indemnification Matters. For purposes of this Article 11
in determining any misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in the representations
and warranties in Article 2 (except the representations and warranties in
Section 2.05, Section 2.06(a)(iii), and Section 2.14(a)) or Article 3 and in
calculating the amount of any Covered Loss, the representations and warranties
in Article 2 or Article 3 shall not be deemed qualified by any reference to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty. Purchaser and
Seller will cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other
Party under this Agreement, including by making commercially reasonably
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

Section 11.06. No Additional Representations. Purchaser acknowledges that it
and its representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with the officers
and employees of the Business to discuss the Business. Purchaser acknowledges
that it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Business. The representations and warranties
specifically set forth in this Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of any kind of Seller or any other Person in
connection with the Transactions. Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller
nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, as to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities,
any information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities furnished or made available to Purchaser and its Representatives,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule.
Purchaser acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, Purchaser will acquire
the Purchased Assets in an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, except
as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

Section 11.07. Limitations on Indemnification.

(d) Seller will have no Liability for indemnification pursuant to Section
11.02(a)(i) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder unless such Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate
$1,000,000 (the "Basket"), in which case Seller will be liable for all such
Covered Losses in excess of the Basket, except that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate indemnification to be paid by
Seller pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i) shall not exceed $35,000,000 (the
"Cap").

(e) The amount of any and all Covered Losses under this Article 11 will be
determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Party or any Affiliate
of such Party under or pursuant to any third-party insurance policy, title
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or Contract (after
reducing such recovery amount, however, by all costs of collection or recovery
and the present value of any increased insurance premiums incurred by such
Party or any Affiliate of such Party). For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts
recovered by any Party or any Affiliate of such Party under or pursuant to any
self-insurance policy, captive insurance policy, or similar policy of such
Party or any of its Affiliates shall be disregarded in determining Covered
Losses under this Article 11.

(f) No indemnifying party will be liable under this Agreement in respect of
any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a change in legislation
or accounting policies or a change in interpretation of applicable Law as
determined by a court or pursuant to an administrative rule-making decision,
in each case to the extent such change occurs after the Closing Date.
Attorney, consultant and other professional fees and disbursements incurred by
an indemnifying party in connection with this Article 11 will be reasonable
and based only on time actually spent, and will be charged at no more than
such professional's standard hourly rate. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any Covered Loss claimed under this
Agreement will be reasonable and in good faith in light of the facts then
known regarding such Covered Loss.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Purchaser Indemnified Party will be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article 11 with regard to any matter to the extent such matter is accounted
for in the Final Working Capital Statement.

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no
indemnified party will be entitled to recover from an indemnifying party more
than once in respect of the same Covered Losses and (ii) Seller will not
indemnify Purchaser or its Affiliates from any Liability for Taxes directly
related to any action taken on or the day after the Closing Date by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (other than any such action expressly required or
permitted by this Agreement or required by applicable Law). 

Section 11.08. Exclusive Remedy. This Article 11 will be the exclusive
monetary remedy of the Parties following the Closing for any losses arising
out of any misrepresentation or breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement, except for
(a) claims of fraud, (b) as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and (c)
equitable remedies, including the right to seek specific performance or
injunctive relief.

Section 11.09. Environmental Indemnification. Purchaser understands and agrees
that each Purchaser Indemnified Party's right to indemnification (a) under
Section 11.02(a)(i) for breach of the representations and warranties contained
in Section 2.16 and (b) under Section 11.02(a)(vi) with respect to DESS will
constitute its sole and exclusive remedy against Seller and its Affiliates
with respect to any violation of or Liability under any Environmental Law
relating to the past, current or future facilities, properties or operations
of Seller, the Business or the Purchased Assets and all of their predecessors
or Affiliates (as applicable), but excluding any violation of or Liability
under any Environmental Law relating to the past, current or future
facilities, properties or operations of DESS or any of its predecessors that
is unrelated to the operation of the Business. Purchaser hereby waives any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost
recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy from Seller or any of its
Affiliates, and hereby releases Seller and its Affiliates from any claim,
demand or liability, in each case with respect to any such violation of or
Liability under any Environmental Law (but excluding any such violation of or
Liability under any Environmental Law with respect to DESS or any of its
predecessors that is unrelated to the operation of the Business). Seller will
have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect
to Covered Losses arising from any conditions of contamination first
identified through any environmental sampling or testing conducted by or on
behalf of Purchaser after the Closing Date that is not explicitly required by
Environmental Law or a Governmental Authority. Seller's obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any Covered Losses
arising from investigatory, corrective or remedial action relating to
conditions of contamination will be limited to investigatory, corrective or
remedial action required by Environmental Law assuming continued industrial
use of the subject property and employing risk-based standards and
institutional controls, in each case where available under applicable
Environmental Law.

Section 11.10. Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made pursuant to
this Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price
to the extent permitted by Law.

is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in
the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

Section 12.04. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement will be paid by
the Party incurring such cost or expense. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller

Purchaser will pay any recording fees and notary fees attributable to or
pertaining to the purchase or sale of the Purchased Assets.

Section 12.05. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns; except that no Party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of each other Party.

Section 12.06. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof.

Section 12.07. Specific Performance; Waiver of Jury Trial; Dispute Resolution.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of
legal remedy and without bond or other security being required, in the courts
of the State of Ohio, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
Party is entitled at law or in equity under this Agreement. In addition, each
of the Parties (a) consents, for purposes of this Section 12.07, to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Ohio located
in Cuyahoga County (and, with respect to claims in which the exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction of such claims is federal, the federal district court for
the Northern District of Ohio) and agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (b) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
other court and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 12.02.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

(c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY 

WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF THE FOREGOING
WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 12.07.

(d) Each Party agrees that before filing an Action other than an Exceptional
Action, it will submit any monetary claims, disputes, controversies, or other
matters in question arising out of the matters covered by Article 11
("Disputes"), to an independent expert appointed in accordance with this
Section 12.07(d) (the "Independent Expert"), who shall serve as sole mediator
for non-binding mediation. Such mediation shall be initiated by the giving of
written notice from the Party requesting mediation. The Independent Expert
shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Seller and the Purchaser from
among candidates with experience and expertise in the area that is the subject
of such Dispute. If the Parties cannot agree on the appointment of the
Independent Expert within 30 days of the notice requesting mediation being
given, then either Party shall be entitled to immediately terminate such non-
binding mediation and, subject to the last sentence of Section 12.07(a), may
file an Action regarding the Dispute. After appointment of the Independent
Expert, each Party to the Dispute shall appoint a designated representative
who shall have the authority to make binding decisions on behalf of the Party
they represent. If Disputes to be resolved by the Parties with assistance of
the Independent Expert are not resolved within 45 days after appointment of
the Independent Expert to the satisfaction of each Party, then either Party
shall be entitled to immediately terminate such non-binding mediation and,
subject to the last sentence of Section 12.07(a), may file an Action regarding
the Dispute. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by the Purchaser and Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, any Disputes
resolved in writing between the Seller and the Purchaser within such 45 day
period shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder,
however, the Independent Expert shall not be authorized to resolve any
Disputes between the Parties and no determination of the Independent Expert
shall resolve any Dispute, be binding on the Parties or be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 12.08. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures were upon the same
instrument. The electronic facsimile transmission of any signed original
counterpart of this Agreement will be deemed to be the delivery of an original
counterpart of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

Section 12.09. Definitional and Interpretative Provisions. The following
provisions will be applied wherever appropriate herein: (a) "herein,"
"hereby," "hereunder," "hereof" and other equivalent words will refer to this
Agreement in its entirety and not solely to the particular portion of this
Agreement in which such word is used; (b) all definitions set forth in this
Agreement will be deemed applicable whether the words defined are used in the
singular or the plural; (c) wherever used, any pronoun or pronouns will be
deemed to include both the singular and plural and to cover all genders; (d)
all accounting terms not specifically defined will be construed in accordance
with GAAP; (e) this Agreement will be deemed to have been drafted by the
Parties and this Agreement will not be construed against any Party as the
principal draftsperson; (f) any references to a particular Section, Article or
Exhibit means a Section or Article of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless
another agreement is specified; (g) all references or citations in this
Agreement to statutes or regulations or statutory or regulatory provisions
will, when the context requires, be considered citations to such statutes,
regulations or provisions directly or indirectly superseding such statutes,
regulations or provisions; (h) the Exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule
attached to this Agreement are incorporated by reference and will be
considered part of this Agreement; (i) the headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of identification only and are not intended to describe,
interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or
any provision; (j) unless otherwise expressly provided, wherever the consent
of any person is required or permitted, such consent may be withheld in such
person's sole and absolute discretion; (k) "including" means "including,
without limitation;" (l) "dollars" or "$" means U.S. dollars; and (m) the word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if." The disclosure
of any matter or item in the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgement that any such matter is required to be disclosed
or is otherwise material. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or in the
Disclosure Schedule but not otherwise defined therein, will have the meaning
as defined in this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the entirety of this Agreement will be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 12.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary
Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 12.11. Disclosure Schedule. There may be included in the Disclosure
Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information that are not
"material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect
the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Disclosures
included in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule will be 

considered to be made for purposes of other Sections of the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to such other
Sections of the Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent from the face of
the disclosure. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 12.12. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
Law, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be re-formed, construed
and enforced in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the
purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 12.13. Bulk Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller and its
Affiliates will not comply with the provisions of any Laws (other than Tax
Laws of New York) with respect to bulk transfers of any jurisdiction in
connection with the Transactions, waives any requirement of compliance with
such Laws and agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, such noncompliance does not constitute a misrepresentation or
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained in this
Agreement; provided, however, that Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against, and pay and
reimburse for, any Liabilities suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
respect of such non-compliance or waiver.

Section 12.14. Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver. As to all
communications among Jones Day, counsel for Seller, Seller and any Affiliate
that relate in any way to the Transactions or to Retained Liabilities
(collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may be
controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, DESS or
any of their respective Affiliates. The Privileged Communications are the
property of Seller, and from and after the Closing none of Purchaser, any DESS
or any of their respective affiliates or any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through Purchaser (including a Hired Employee), DESS or any other
Affiliate of Purchaser will seek to obtain such communications, whether by
seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means. As
to any such Privileged Communications prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and
DESS, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns,
further agree that no such Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action against or involving any of the Parties after the
Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than DESS) in connection with any dispute that relates in
any way to the Transactions, including in any claim for indemnification
brought by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Purchaser, DESS or any of their Affiliates and a third
party (other than a Party or any of their respective Affiliates) after the
Closing, Purchaser may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential 

communications by counsel for Seller to such third party; provided, however,
that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Seller.
