Article II 
  _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Election; 
 Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of GeoEye,
DigitalGlobe, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2 or the holder of any shares of
DigitalGlobe Capital Stock or GeoEye Capital Stock:

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and DigitalGlobe-Owned Stock_.
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of GeoEye (the "
_GeoEye  Common Stock_") and each share of GeoEye Preferred Stock that is
owned by GeoEye as treasury stock and each share of GeoEye Common Stock, if
any, that is owned by DigitalGlobe immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, in Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into 1 fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
until the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation issues new
certificates in respect of such shares.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of GeoEye Common Stock_. Subject to Sections
2.01(e) and 2.01(f), each share of GeoEye Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.01(a) and Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided
in Section 2.01(f)) shall be converted into the right to receive the following
consideration (the " _Common  Merger Consideration_"), as applicable:

  



  

(i) Each share of GeoEye Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_
") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.02
(each, a " _Mixed Consideration Electing Share_ ") and each Non-Electing
GeoEye Share shall be converted into the right to receive the combination
(which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Mixed
Consideration_ ") of (x) $4.10 in cash (the " _Mixed Election Per Share
Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 1.137 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock (the " _Mixed Election Stock
Exchange Ratio_ "). The Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio shall be
calculated to the nearest one-thousandth of a share of DigitalGlobe Common
Stock.

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) Each share of GeoEye Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive all cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively
made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.02 (each, a " _Cash
Electing GeoEye Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $20.27
in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_
"); except that if (A) the product of the number of Cash Electing GeoEye
Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the
" _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) the difference between (x) the product
of the Mixed Election Per Share Cash Amount and the total number of shares of
GeoEye Common Stock (other than shares canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(a) and Dissenting Shares which were previously shares of GeoEye
Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
minus (y) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Shares
(including any Non-Electing GeoEye Shares) and the Mixed Election Per Share
Cash Amount (such difference being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_
"), then each Cash Electing GeoEye Share shall instead be converted into the
right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the
product of (x) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being
the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
DigitalGlobe (" _DigitalGlobe Common Stock_ ") equal to the product of (x)
the Common Exchange Ratio and (y) 1 minus the Cash Fraction.

  



  

(iii) Each share of GeoEye Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive all stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is
properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.02 (each, a "
_Stock Electing GeoEye Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive
1.425 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock (the " _Common Exchange Ratio_ ") (together with
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.03(e), the " _Stock Consideration_ "); except that if
the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then
each Stock Electing GeoEye Share shall instead be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such
excess divided by the number of Stock Electing GeoEye Shares and (B) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of DigitalGlobe Common
Stock equal to the product of (1) the Common Exchange Ratio and (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (A) of this Section
2.01(c)(iii) and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration. The Common Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to
the nearest one-thousandth of a share of DigitalGlobe Common Stock.

All such shares of GeoEye Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of GeoEye
Common Stock (each, a " _Common Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of DigitalGlobe
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends
or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of
such Common Certificate in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

  



  

(d) _Conversion of GeoEye Preferred Stock_. Subject to Sections
2.01(e) and 2.01(f), each share of GeoEye Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(a) and Dissenting Shares (to the
extent provided in Section 2.01(f)) shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive that number of fully paid
and nonassessable share of a newly-designated series of DigitalGlobe Preferred
Stock (the " _DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock_ "), having the powers,
designations, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations
and restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Designations for such
DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock attached as _Exhibit 2.01(d)_ , equal
to the Preferred Exchange Ratio and $4.10 in cash for each share of GeoEye
Common Stock into which such share of GeoEye Preferred Stock is convertible
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Preferred Merger
Consideration_ " and, together with the Common Merger Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of GeoEye Preferred Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of
shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of GeoEye Preferred Stock (each, a " _Preferred
Certificate_ " and, together with the Common Certificates, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Preferred Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration
therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.03, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Preferred Exchange
Ratio_ " means 1.000. The Preferred Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to the
nearest one-thousandth of a share of DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock, GeoEye
Common Stock or GeoEye Preferred Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein (including any exchange
ratio) which is based upon the number of shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock,
GeoEye Common Stock or GeoEye Preferred Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to DigitalGlobe and the holders of GeoEye
Common Stock and GeoEye Preferred Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") of GeoEye Capital Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c) or 2.01(d), as applicable, but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 shall cease and (i) with respect to GeoEye Common
Stock, such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration
Electing Shares that have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the right to receive the Mixed Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c)(i) and (ii) with respect to GeoEye Preferred Stock, such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Preferred Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(d). GeoEye shall serve prompt
written notice (but in any event within 48 hours) to DigitalGlobe of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of GeoEye Common Stock and any withdrawals
of such demands, and DigitalGlobe shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, GeoEye shall not, without the prior written consent of
DigitalGlobe, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(g) _Conversion of Surviving Corporation Common Stock_. At the
effective time of the Subsequent Merger, and without any action on the part
of DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, Merger Sub 2 or any holder of shares thereof, each
share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one limited
liability company interest of the Surviving LLC and shall constitute the only
limited liability company interests of the Surviving LLC. From and after the
effective time of the Subsequent Merger, all certificates representing shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of limited liability company interests of the Surviving
LLC into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.

Section 2.02 _Election Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Not less than 10 Business Days prior to the mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement, DigitalGlobe shall appoint a bank or trust company selected
by DigitalGlobe and reasonably acceptable to GeoEye (provided that
DigitalGlobe\'s transfer agent shall be deemed reasonably satisfactory to
GeoEye) to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Date, is a record
holder of shares of GeoEye Common Stock other than Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to specify the number of such holder\'s shares of GeoEye Common Stock
with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, a Stock Election or
a Mixed Election.

  



  

(c) DigitalGlobe shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Form
S-4 a form of election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to GeoEye. The Form of Election shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. GeoEye shall mail the Form of Election
with the Joint Proxy Statement to all persons who are record holders of shares
of GeoEye Common Stock as of the record date for GeoEye Stockholders Meeting.
The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of GeoEye
Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner
through proper instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails to make a
Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election with respect to any
shares of GeoEye Common Stock held or beneficially owned by such holder, then
such holder shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to
those shares (each such share, a " _Non-Electing GeoEye Share_ "). GeoEye
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election
available to all persons who become record holders of shares of GeoEye Common
Stock during the period between the record date for the GeoEye
Stockholders Meeting and the Election Date. Unless the properly completed
Form of Election provides otherwise, for all purposes of this Section and in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), (i) a holder
will be treated as having surrendered, in exchange for the total amount of
the Merger Consideration received in cash, if any, to be paid to such holder
under this Article II (with respect to a holder, the " _Cash Portion_ "), the
number of shares of GeoEye Common Stock, GeoEye Preferred Stock, or both, as
applicable, of such holder as to which such holder has a right to receive cash
pursuant to Sections 2.01(c) and 2.01(d); and (ii) for purposes of clause
(i), the Certificates surrendered by a holder in exchange for such holder\'s
Cash Portion will be deemed to be: (A) first, of those Certificates
evidencing shares held by such holder for more than one year before the Merger
within the meaning of Section 1223 of the Code, if any, those Certificates
with the highest United States federal income tax basis, in descending order
until such Certificates are exhausted or the Cash Portion for such holder is
fully paid, then (B) of all other of such holder\'s Certificates, those
Certificates with the highest United States federal income tax basis, in
descending order until the Cash Portion for such holder is fully paid.

(d) Any holder's election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on (i) the date of the GeoEye Stockholders Meeting or (ii)
if the Closing Date is more than four Business Days following the GeoEye
Stockholders Meeting, 2 Business Days preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Election Date_ "), a Form of Election properly and fully completed and
signed and accompanied by (A) in the case of shares of GeoEye Common
Stock represented by a Certificate, Certificates representing the shares of
GeoEye Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in
blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of GeoEye (or
by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in
such Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution"
(as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); provided that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set
forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of shares of GeoEye
Common Stock held in book-entry form, any additional documents required by
the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any shares
of GeoEye Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares
shall be made on the stock transfer books of GeoEye, unless and until such
Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election is properly revoked.

  



  

(e) DigitalGlobe and GeoEye shall publicly announce the anticipated
Election Date at least 7 Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date
shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and DigitalGlobe and GeoEye
shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Date.

  



  

(f) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election may be
revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of GeoEye Common Stock
subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Cash Elections, Stock
Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be revoked if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII. If a Cash Election, a
Stock Election or a Mixed Election is revoked, the shares as to which such
election previously applied shall be treated as Non-Electing GeoEye Shares
unless a contrary election is submitted by the holder within the period during
which elections are permitted to be made pursuant to Section 2.02(d).
Certificates will not be returned to holders, and the accounts of holders of
shares GeoEye Common Stock held in book-entry form will not be credited at
the Depository Trust Company, unless the holder so requests.

  



  

(g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of DigitalGlobe and GeoEye, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and
binding as to whether or not Cash Elections, Stock Elections or Mixed
Elections shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section
2.02 and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections, Mixed Elections and
revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or
DigitalGlobe and GeoEye jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations
contemplated by Section 2.01(c), and absent manifest error this computation
shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written
agreement of DigitalGlobe, make any rules as are consistent with this Section
2.02 for the implementation of the Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed
Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to
effect these Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections.

Section 2.03 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
DigitalGlobe shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock and DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock to be
issued as Merger Consideration, cash payable as Merger Consideration and cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.03(e). All such DigitalGlobe Common Stock, DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter,
DigitalGlobe shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of GeoEye Common Stock and GeoEye Preferred Stock whose shares were converted
into Merger Consideration a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as DigitalGlobe may
specify, subject to GeoEye's reasonable approval), together with instructions
thereto.

  



  

(b) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_.
Upon (i) in the case of shares of GeoEye Capital Stock represented by
a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of GeoEye Capital Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent, in
each case together with the letter of transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the
DigitalGlobe Common Stock or DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, into which the shares of GeoEye Capital Stock have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01 (after taking into account all shares of GeoEye
Common Stock to which an election or non-election has been made), and (B) a
check in an amount equal to (1) the cash (including cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.03(e)), if any, into which such holder's shares of GeoEye Capital
Stock were converted in accordance with this Article II plus (2) any cash in
respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(c). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of GeoEye Capital Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of GeoEye, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock or DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, or cash, in each case, pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu
of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.03(e) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(c) may be issued
to a transferee if the Certificate representing such GeoEye Capital Stock (or,
if such GeoEye Capital Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of
such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.03(b), each share of GeoEye Capital Stock and
any Certificate with respect thereto shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holders of such shares were entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e) and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of GeoEye Capital Stock held in book-entry form).

(c) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares of GeoEye Capital Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
DigitalGlobe Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of GeoEye
Capital Stock held in book-entry form) with respect to the shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock or DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock , as
applicable, issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.03(e), until the surrender of such Certificate (or shares of GeoEye Capital
Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or shares of GeoEye Capital Stock held in book-entry form), there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificate representing shares of
DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock or whole shares of DigitalGlobe Common
Stock, as applicable, issued in exchange therefor pursuant to Section
2.01(c), without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of DigitalGlobe Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(e) and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and a payment date prior to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock and such whole shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock and such whole shares of
DigitalGlobe Common Stock, as applicable, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of DigitalGlobe Series
A Preferred Stock and such whole shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock, as
applicable.

  



  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in GeoEye Capital Stock_. The
shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock or DigitalGlobe Series A Preferred Stock,
as applicable, issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of GeoEye Capital Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
GeoEye Capital Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of GeoEye Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of GeoEye Capital Stock (or shares
of GeoEye Capital Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to DigitalGlobe
or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of GeoEye Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a holder of DigitalGlobe Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of GeoEye Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of DigitalGlobe Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of GeoEye Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the average of the volume weighted average
price per share of DigitalGlobe Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by DigitalGlobe and GeoEye) on each of the 20
consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day prior to
the date of the Effective Time, weighted by the total volume of trading in
DigitalGlobe Common Stock on each such trading day. The payment of cash in
lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section 2.03(e) is not a
separately bargained-for consideration. Fractional shares of DigitalGlobe
Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in exchange for shares of GeoEye
Preferred Stock.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of GeoEye Capital Stock for 360 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to DigitalGlobe, upon demand, and any
holder of GeoEye Capital Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to DigitalGlobe for payment of its
claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Article II.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of GeoEye, DigitalGlobe, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub 2, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving LLC or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 2 years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of DigitalGlobe, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by DigitalGlobe. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
DigitalGlobe.

  



  

(i) _FIRPTA; Withholding Rights_.

  



  

(i) Not more than thirty (30) days prior to Closing, GeoEye shall
deliver to DigitalGlobe a certificate, substantially in the form provided for
in Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations,
establishing that GeoEye is not a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, and has not
been such a United States real property holding corporation within the 5 year
period ending on the Closing Date, and a copy of notice provided to the
IRS in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.897-2(h)(2) of the
Treasury Regulations.

(ii) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Law. The Exchange Agent shall provide
commercially reasonable notice to GeoEye upon becoming aware of any such
withholding obligation and shall cooperate with GeoEye to the extent
reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction and
withholding. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

  



  

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by DigitalGlobe, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as DigitalGlobe may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on the Certificate
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

in this Article III are true and correct, except (i) as set forth in the
DigitalGlobe Reporting Documents publicly available and filed with the SEC
following January 1, 2010 and at least 2 Business Days prior to the date of

by DigitalGlobe of this Agreement (the " _DigitalGlobe Disclosure Letter_ ").
The DigitalGlobe Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in
this Article III, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to
qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent (and only to the
extent) that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections.

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of
DigitalGlobe and each of the Subsidiaries of DigitalGlobe (the "
_DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in
the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such
concept), except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a DigitalGlobe Material Adverse Effect. Each
of DigitalGlobe and the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries has all requisite power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations, clearances and
approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary to enable it to own,

businesses as presently conducted (the " _DigitalGlobe Permits_ "), except
where the failure to have such power or authority or to possess DigitalGlobe
Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a DigitalGlobe Material Adverse Effect. Each
of DigitalGlobe and the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a DigitalGlobe Material Adverse
Effect. DigitalGlobe has delivered or made available to GeoEye, prior to
execution of this Agreement, (a) true and complete copies of the Certificate

another DigitalGlobe Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, claims,
charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests), except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Section 3.02(a) of the
DigitalGlobe Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a

respectively, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares
of DigitalGlobe Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the

(a) DigitalGlobe has furnished or filed, as applicable, all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and
other information incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by
DigitalGlobe with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (such documents, together
with any documents filed with the SEC during such period by DigitalGlobe on a
voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, but excluding the Joint
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the "
_DigitalGlobe Reporting Documents_ ").

  



  

(b) Each DigitalGlobe Reporting Document (i) at the time filed,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the Exchange Act or the Securities Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such DigitalGlobe Reporting Document and (ii) did
not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such
filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial
statements of DigitalGlobe included in the DigitalGlobe Reporting Documents
complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of DigitalGlobe and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). There are no
outstanding comments from the staff of the SEC with respect to any
DigitalGlobe Reporting Documents.

operations of DigitalGlobe, (iv) liabilities incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) liabilities or
obligations discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, DigitalGlobe
and the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries do not have, and since March 31, 2012,
DigitalGlobe and the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries have not incurred (except as
permitted by Section 5.01), any liabilities or obligations of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, absolute, matured, determined, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not required to be reflected in DigitalGlobe's
financial statements in accordance with GAAP).

  



  

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of DigitalGlobe and the
chief financial officer of DigitalGlobe (or each former chief
executive officer of DigitalGlobe and each former chief financial officer of
DigitalGlobe, as applicable) has made all applicable certifications required
by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
SOX with respect to the DigitalGlobe Reporting Documents, and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate. None of DigitalGlobe
or any of the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

in all material respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which

consolidated financial position of GeoEye and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by GeoEye are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by GeoEye in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of GeoEye, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of GeoEye to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
GeoEye and any of the GeoEye Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, GeoEye or any of the GeoEye Subsidiaries in GeoEye's or such
GeoEye Subsidiary's published financial statements or other GeoEye Reporting
Documents.

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by GeoEye with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by DigitalGlobe, Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 for

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation by DigitalGlobe; DigitalGlobe Board
Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) DigitalGlobe shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its Affiliates or any of its and their respective directors, officers or
employees or any of their respective investment bankers, accountants,
attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any DigitalGlobe Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead
to a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal, (ii) directly or indirectly participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than DigitalGlobe's
Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a Person
making a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal) with respect to any DigitalGlobe
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal or (iii) waive, terminate, modify
or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person (other than the other party hereto) with
respect to DigitalGlobe or any DigitalGlobe Subsidiary. DigitalGlobe (A)
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal, request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives
and (B) shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval
under any confidentiality or "standstill" or similar provision that may have
been heretofore given by it or any DigitalGlobe Subsidiary under any such
provisions authorizing any Person to make a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
DigitalGlobe Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal that the DigitalGlobe Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal, and which DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal
was not solicited by DigitalGlobe, its Affiliates or Representatives after the
date of this Agreement and was made after the date of this Agreement and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), DigitalGlobe, and
its Representatives at the request of DigitalGlobe, may, subject to compliance
with Section 5.02, (A) furnish information with respect to DigitalGlobe and
the DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries to the Person making such DigitalGlobe Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to GeoEye or is provided to GeoEye prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal and
the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such
DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal (and such Person's Representatives). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by any Representative of
DigitalGlobe or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of
this Section 5.02(a) by DigitalGlobe. Except as set forth in Section 5.02(b),
neither the DigitalGlobe Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to GeoEye), or propose publicly to

recommendation or declaration of advisability by the DigitalGlobe Board or any
such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal (any action in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow DigitalGlobe or
any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or
arrangement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or that
is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any DigitalGlobe
Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause,
DigitalGlobe, Merger Sub or Merger Sub 2 to abandon, terminate, delay or fail
to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, DigitalGlobe
to fail to comply with this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.02(a), at any time prior to the
earlier of obtaining the DigitalGlobe Stockholder Approval and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the DigitalGlobe Board may
(i) following receipt of a DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal after the execution
of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a) and
that the DigitalGlobe Board or an authorized and empowered committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors constitutes a Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal (A) make a
DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement

DigitalGlobe Proposal or (ii) solely in response to any material
event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or

Intervening Event_ ") make a DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation Change; in
each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if the
DigitalGlobe Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. The DigitalGlobe Board shall not be entitled to (x)
exercise its right to make a DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), in
connection with a Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal or (y) make a DigitalGlobe
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a DigitalGlobe Intervening Event
pursuant to this Section 5.02(b), unless both of the following conditions have
been met: (i) DigitalGlobe shall have provided prior written notice to
GeoEye, at least five (5) Business Days in advance (the "
_DigitalGlobe Notice Period_ ") of its intention to effect a DigitalGlobe
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.01(h) and specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case of
a Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal the terms and conditions of any Superior
DigitalGlobe Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
DigitalGlobe Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any
material term of such Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal shall require a new
written notice from DigitalGlobe and a new DigitalGlobe Notice Period) and
(ii) prior to effecting such DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h) in response to a
Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal, DigitalGlobe shall, and shall cause its legal
and financial advisors to, during the DigitalGlobe Notice Period, negotiate
with GeoEye in good faith (to the extent GeoEye desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior DigitalGlobe Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior DigitalGlobe
Proposal.

thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such DigitalGlobe Takeover
Proposal. DigitalGlobe shall (i) keep GeoEye informed in all material respects
on a reasonably current basis of the status and details (including any change
to the terms thereof) of any DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide
to GeoEye as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of
all correspondence and other written material exchanged between DigitalGlobe
or any DigitalGlobe Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Person making any
such DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal, on the other hand, that describes any of
the terms or conditions of any DigitalGlobe Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
the DigitalGlobe Board nor any committee thereof shall be entitled to make a
DigitalGlobe Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.02(b) or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h) with respect to a
DigitalGlobe Intervening Event, unless DigitalGlobe has provided GeoEye with
written information describing such DigitalGlobe Intervening Event in
reasonable detail promptly after becoming aware of it, and keeps GeoEye
reasonably informed of material developments with respect to such
DigitalGlobe Intervening Event.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit
DigitalGlobe from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
DigitalGlobe if, in the good faith judgment of the DigitalGlobe Board (after
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall DigitalGlobe or the DigitalGlobe Board or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by Section 5.02(b).

(f) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing with or submission to a Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before, or communications with, a Governmental Entity
(including the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence) relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding initiated by
a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal
Communications Commission, the Department of Commerce or any other
Governmental Entity (including the Department of Defense and the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence) and of any communication received or given
by a private party in connection with any governmental inquiry, investigation
or proceeding, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, DigitalGlobe shall have the right to direct all matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; provided that
each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each party will consult the other on and will take
into account the reasonable inputs, comments and recommendations of the other
party on, all the information relating to the other parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, written materials submitted to, or oral presentations made to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with any governmental inquiry,
investigation or proceeding with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each party shall have the right to attend (to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Authority), and each party shall promptly and fully
inform the other party about material conferences and meetings with
regulators concerning the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, DigitalGlobe shall have
the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, communications or satellite-
related clearances and other approvals of Governmental Authorities, and shall
take the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity
in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the cooperation of the parties
required by this Section 6.03(f), in the event the parties do not agree with
respect to any matter in connection with the required clearances and
approvals from Governmental Authorities, DigitalGlobe's decision will control,
provided that such decision does not interfere with GeoEye's ability to
control its operations prior to Closing, and otherwise is consistent with
GeoEye's obligations under the Law, including but not limited to the
Communications Act. DigitalGlobe and GeoEye may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this Section 6.03(f) as " _Antitrust Counsel Only
Material_." Such Antitrust Counsel Only Material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (GeoEye or DigitalGlobe, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.03(f), materials provided to the other party or its outside
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation,
pricing and other competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective
in the Contracts of GeoEye, DigitalGlobe and their respective Subsidiaries.

in no event shall DigitalGlobe or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required
to agree to (i) divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material
portion of its or GeoEye\'s respective businesses, assets or Contracts or
allow a third party to utilize a material amount of the capacity on its or
GeoEye\'s satellites or (ii) take any other action that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact
on the business, assets, Contracts or properties of DigitalGlobe and
GeoEye, taken as a whole. As long as the following actions of GeoEye are
conditioned on Closing, DigitalGlobe may, if it so chooses, cause GeoEye to
(i) divest, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or allow a third
party to utilize, any portion of its respective businesses, assets or
Contracts or (ii) take any other action that would have an impact on the
business, assets, Contracts or properties of GeoEye or its Subsidiaries.

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such GeoEye Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
number of shares of DigitalGlobe Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of GeoEye Common
Stock subject to such GeoEye Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Common Exchange Ratio, at a per share exercise price, rounded up

price of such GeoEye Stock Option by the Common Exchange Ratio; provided,

Restricted Stock Units to provide that each award of Restricted Stock Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall represent the right
to receive, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
award immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) a maximum number of shares
of DigitalGlobe Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the maximum number of shares of GeoEye Common Stock
subject to such award of GeoEye Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio and (ii) a
maximum amount of cash, rounded down to the nearest whole cent, determined by
multiplying the maximum number of shares of GeoEye Common Stock subject to

thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as it deems

procedures as may be determined by GeoEye in its sole discretion consistent

of such GeoEye Restricted Stock Awards consideration consistent with the
principles set forth in Section 2.01, provided, however, that with respect to
any GeoEye Restricted Stock Award that does not become vested upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) any
DigitalGlobe Common Stock to be issued in respect of such GeoEye
Restricted Stock Award to the holder thereof shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture restrictions) as were
applicable to the corresponding GeoEye Restricted Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any cash payable in respect of such
GeoEye Restricted Stock Award to the holder thereof shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including vesting and forfeiture restrictions) as
were applicable to the corresponding GeoEye Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such that such cash shall be paid to
the holder of such GeoEye Restricted Stock Award by the Surviving Corporation
only if and to the extent (and at the time) that such GeoEye Restricted Stock
Award otherwise would have become vested and non-forfeitable.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the GeoEye Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions (including using reasonable efforts to obtain any required
consents) to effect the following, without further action by any Person:

participant in the GeoEye Stock Plan, or in any other GeoEye Benefit Plan or
GeoEye Benefit Agreement), will have any right thereunder to acquire any
capital stock of GeoEye or any GeoEye Subsidiary or any other equity interest
therein.

  



  

(f) At the Effective Time, DigitalGlobe shall assume all the
obligations of GeoEye under the GeoEye Stock Plans, each GeoEye Stock
Option, GeoEye Restricted Stock Award and GeoEye Restricted Stock Unit

Options, GeoEye Restricted Stock Award and GeoEye Restricted Stock Units and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of 6 years after the Effective Time, DigitalGlobe
shall, and shall cause the Surviving LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors and
employees of GeoEye or the GeoEye Subsidiaries or were serving at the request
of GeoEye as an officer, director or employee of any other corporation,
partnership or joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of
GeoEye or any of the GeoEye Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective
Time to the extent provided under the GeoEye Charter or GeoEye By-laws in
effect on the date of this Agreement (including with respect to the
advancement of expenses). Prior to Closing, GeoEye may, for the benefit of
those Persons who are currently covered by GeoEye's or any GeoEye
Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, cause
coverage to be extended under such policies by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy containing terms that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that the annualized
premiums for such policy shall not be in excess of 200% of the last annual
premium paid by GeoEye prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case GeoEye may purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. From and after the
Closing, DigitalGlobe shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC to, cause such
"tail" policy to remain in full force and effect and shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates to amend, waive, modify or otherwise alter the
terms thereunder. To the extent any claim is asserted or made within such
six-year period, such "tail" policy shall be continued in respect of such
claim until the final disposition thereof. To the extent GeoEye does not
obtain such a "tail" policy prior to the Closing, for a period of 6 years
after the Effective Time, DigitalGlobe shall, or shall cause the Surviving LLC
to, cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by GeoEye (provided that
DigitalGlobe or the Surviving LLC, as the case may be, may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however,
that, after the Effective Time, neither DigitalGlobe nor the Surviving LLC,
as the case may be, shall be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 200%
of the last annual premium paid by GeoEye prior to the date hereof in respect
of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.
DigitalGlobe shall, and shall cause the Surviving LLC to, honor all
indemnification agreements with the Indemnitees (including under the GeoEye
By-laws) in effect as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  



  

(b) In the event that DigitalGlobe or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, DigitalGlobe shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
DigitalGlobe assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise. DigitalGlobe shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
Section 6.05, provided that such Indemnitee is successful in enforcing any
such enforcement claim.

Proxy Statement and Form S-4 and the Tax opinions described in Sections
7.02(d) and 7.03(d), including by (i) delivering to Latham and Watkins LLP and
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, prior to the filing of the Joint
Proxy Statement and Form S-4, tax representation letters in substantially the
form attached to this Agreement as Section 6.07(a) of the GeoEye Disclosure

Affiliate to, take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be
untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction
would cause to be untrue) any of the representations and covenants made to
counsel in the tax representation letters described in this Section 6.07 or
that would cause the Combination to fail to qualify as a

GeoEye Notes and all reports and statements required to be filed with the
SEC) in connection with the Debt Tender Offer and Consent. Such documentation
shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, each party and such
party's legal counsel. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt
Tender Offer and Consent any information in such documentation is discovered
by GeoEye or DigitalGlobe that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to such documentation, so that such documentation shall not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, then the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
(including incorporating by reference) shall be prepared by the parties
(subject to the reasonable review of, and comment by, their respective legal
counsel) describing such information and shall be disseminated by or on

Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the Debt Tender
Offer and Consent process. GeoEye shall keep DigitalGlobe reasonably informed
and shall promptly provide DigitalGlobe all material information regarding
the status, results and timing of the Debt Tender Offer and Consent. If the
holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding GeoEye Notes needed to consent to amendments of GeoEye Indentures
have so consented, GeoEye shall promptly execute supplemental indentures to
such GeoEye Indenture to effectuate such amendments that will become
operative only immediately upon the Effective Time and shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the trustee under each such GeoEye Indenture to enter into
each such applicable supplemental indenture prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing.

  



  

(e) At DigitalGlobe's written request, GeoEye shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries party to the applicable GeoEye Indenture to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take all actions necessary and
required to effect the redemption of any GeoEye Notes that otherwise would
remain outstanding at the Closing and the satisfaction and discharge of any
GeoEye Indenture with respect to any such GeoEye Notes, which satisfaction
and discharge shall be effective upon the Closing; and GeoEye, if so requested
by DigitalGlobe, shall concurrently with the Closing (w) give irrevocable
instructions to the trustee under the applicable GeoEye Indenture to mail a
notice of redemption to holders of such GeoEye Notes pursuant to such GeoEye
Indenture, (x) deposit in trust all required funds or Government Securities
(as defined in the applicable GeoEye Indenture) with respect to such
redemption as set forth in the applicable GeoEye Indenture and give
irrevocable instructions to the trustee under such GeoEye Indenture to
apply the deposit toward the payment of such GeoEye Notes upon redemption,
(y) pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable pursuant to such GeoEye
Indenture, and (z) deliver to the trustee under the applicable GeoEye
Indenture such "Officers' Certificates," "Opinions of Counsel," any required
accountants' certificates and "Board Resolutions" in connection with a
redemption (as such terms are defined in the applicable GeoEye Indenture) in
form and substance satisfactory to such trustee as to satisfaction of all
conditions precedent to such satisfaction and discharge, such redemption and
as to the other matters set forth in the applicable GeoEye Indenture; and
GeoEye shall take all such other actions as are required to satisfy and
discharge each such GeoEye Indenture; and GeoEye shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under each GeoEye Indenture to
acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of such GeoEye Indenture in writing
promptly upon satisfaction of the conditions therein. For the avoidance of
doubt, GeoEye shall not be obligated to call for redemption any GeoEye Notes
or make any payments or deposit any funds under this Section 6.16(e) unless
GeoEye shall have received from DigitalGlobe the amounts required to deposit
with the applicable trustee to pay the redemption price for the applicable
GeoEye Notes as required pursuant to the applicable GeoEye Indenture and pay
or cause to be paid all other sums, including accrued interest and trustee
fees and expenses, payable pursuant to such GeoEye Indenture in connection
therewith.

Section 6.17 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Unless, and to the extent, DigitalGlobe has sufficient cash from
other sources available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement and
for the Refinancing, from and after the execution of this Agreement,
DigitalGlobe shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, any replacement of all or
any portion of any facilities (or commitments thereof) described in, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter, if such
amendment, modification, replacement or waiver (i) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount except by operation of the "market
flex" provisions) or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of any
portion of the Financing in a manner that would or would reasonably be
expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing or the Closing Date or (B) make
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less
likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of DigitalGlobe to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements, in any material respect, including any right to seek specific
performance of the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements. Subject to
the limitations set out in the first sentence of this Section 6.17(a),
DigitalGlobe may amend, supplement, modify or replace the Commitment Letter as
in effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (y) to increase the
amount of indebtedness and (z) to replace all or a portion of the
facility committed under the Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date
hereof with one or more new facilities under such Commitment Letter or under
any new commitment letter or facility (any such new commitment or facility, a
" _Replacement Facility_ ") in a manner not materially less beneficial to
DigitalGlobe (as determined in the reasonable judgment of DigitalGlobe),
provided that any amendments, modifications or replacements of any
Replacement Facility shall be subject to the same limitations that apply to
the Commitment Letter as set forth in the first sentence of this Section
6.17(a). For purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "Financing" shall be
deemed to include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this Section 6.17
(including any Replacement Facility, any Alternative Financing), and (2)
the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter
as may be permitted to be amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this
Section 6.17, any Replacement Facility, and any commitment letters with
respect to the Alternative Financing and any related fee letters (it being
understood that any Replacement Facility or Alternative Financing shall be
subject to the terms herein that apply to the Commitment Letter).

(b) Unless, and to the extent, DigitalGlobe has sufficient cash from
other sources available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement and
for the Refinancing, DigitalGlobe shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms (except for
amendments not prohibited by Section 6.17(a)) until the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Commitment Letter (" _Definitive Agreements_ ") or on other terms not
materially less favorable to DigitalGlobe than the terms and conditions
(including any applicable "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of)
all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter that are within its
control and consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter at or prior to the
Closing, (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter in the event of
a breach or other failure to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Refinancing on the Closing Date by the lenders and other Persons providing
Financing and (v) comply in all material respects with its covenants and other
obligations under the Commitment Letter (or obtain the waiver thereof).

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, DigitalGlobe
shall give GeoEye reasonably prompt notice: (i) of any material breach
or default by any party to the Commitment Letter or definitive document
related to the Financing of which it becomes aware; (ii) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source
with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing
of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related
to the Financing and (iii) if for any reason DigitalGlobe believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
required to consummate the Refinancing.

  



  

(d) Unless, and to the extent, DigitalGlobe has sufficient cash from
other sources available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement and
for the Refinancing, in the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment
Letter, DigitalGlobe shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable, arrange alternative debt financing from the same or alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Refinancing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") following the occurrence of such event; provided
however, that DigitalGlobe shall not be required to obtain financing which
includes terms and conditions materially less favorable (taking into account
any "market flex" provision) to DigitalGlobe, in each case relative to those
in the Financing being replaced. DigitalGlobe shall promptly notify GeoEye of
the receipt of any written notice from any lender named in the Commitment
Letter to withdraw, terminate or reduce the aggregate amount of Financing
contemplated by, the Commitment Letter.

providing the Financing Sources and their agents with all financial and other

delivered pursuant to the Commitment Letter or as may be reasonably requested
by DigitalGlobe or the Financing Sources or their respective agents to
prepare customary bank information memoranda and lender presentations
in connection with such Financing; (ii) participating (including by making

cooperating with the Financing Sources' and its agents' due diligence, to the
extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of GeoEye; (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for any portion of the
Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to ensure that any
syndication effort benefits from any existing banking relationship; (v)
reasonably cooperating with DigitalGlobe's preparation of bank information
memoranda and similar documents, rating agency presentations, and road show
presentations used to complete such Financing, to the extent information
contained therein relates to the business of GeoEye and GeoEye Subsidiaries;
(vi) using reasonable best efforts to cause its certified independent auditors
to provide, in connection with the Financing, (A) applicable consent to SEC
filings that include or incorporate GeoEye's consolidated financial

appropriate) and their reports thereon, in each case, to the extent such
consent is required, auditors reports and comfort letters with respect to
financial information relating to GeoEye and GeoEye Subsidiaries in customary
form and (B) other documentation (including reasonable assistance in the
preparation of pro forma financial statements by DigitalGlobe, to the extent
such other documentation is required); provided that it is understood that
assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments to be made are the
responsibility of DigitalGlobe; (vii) providing customary certificates, legal
opinions of internal counsel or other customary closing documents as may be
reasonably requested by DigitalGlobe or its Financing Sources in connection
with the Financing; (viii) entering into one or more credit or other

reasonably cooperating with DigitalGlobe in providing customary information

subject to the occurrence of the Closing, taking corporate actions necessary
to permit the consummation of the Financing; (xii) assisting DigitalGlobe as
reasonably requested thereby in seeking to obtain ratings from Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Rating Services, a division of
The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., with respect to the borrower of the
Financing and the senior secured facilities described in the Commitment
Letter; and (xiii) delivering to DigitalGlobe for further distribution to the
lenders under the Financing all documentation and other information required

however, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of GeoEye or the
GeoEye Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) neither GeoEye nor any
of the GeoEye Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would
subject it to actual or potential liability, to bear any out-of-pocket cost or
expense not reimbursed by DigitalGlobe or to pay any commitment or any
similar fee or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing, prior to

rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties

sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if

the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (a)
below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable
for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide
an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
Delaware state court or any Federal court located in the State of Delaware in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring

Delaware state court or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action,
suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this
Section 9.11.

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES

  

AND RIGHTS OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

  

OF

  



  

DIGITALGLOBE, INC.

  



  

DigitalGlobe, Inc. (the "Company"), a corporation organized and existing
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), does
hereby certify that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") by Article Fourth of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, and pursuant to Section
151 of the DGCL, the Board adopted resolutions (i) designating a series of
the Company\'s previously authorized preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, and (ii) providing for the designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof, of eighty thousand (80,000) shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, as follows:

  



  

RESOLVED, that the Company is authorized to issue eighty thousand (80,000)
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the "Preferred Shares"), which shall have the following powers,
designations, preferences and other special rights:

  



  

(1) _Preferred Dividends_. The holders of the Preferred Shares (each, a
"Holder" and collectively, the "Holders") shall be entitled to receive
cumulative dividends ("Dividends") at the Dividend Rate payable on the
Liquidation Preference of such Preferred Shares as of the applicable Dividend
Date (or, for the initial Dividend Period, as of the Initial Issuance Date).
Dividends on the Preferred Shares shall commence accruing on the Initial
Issuance Date and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and actual
days elapsed. Dividends shall be payable in arrears on January 1, April 1,
July 1, and October 1 (each, a "Dividend Date" and each such quarterly period
(or shorter period in the case of the first such period following the Initial
Issuance Date) being a "Dividend Period") with the first Dividend Date
being [ ], 20[ ]. If a Dividend Date is not a Business Day, then the Dividend
shall be payable on the Business Day immediately following such Dividend
Date. At the Company\'s option, dividends may be declared and paid in cash out
of funds legally available therefor, when, as and if declared by the Company;
provided that if Dividends are not declared and paid in cash on any Dividend
Date for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, then such Dividend shall
automatically accrue and be added to the Liquidation Preference as of such
Dividend Date, whether or not declared by the Board and whether or not in any
Dividend Period or Periods there shall be funds of the Company legally
available for the payment of such Dividends. On each Dividend Date, if the
Company does not have current or accumulated "earnings and profits" within
the meaning of Sections 301 and 312 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, through such Dividend Date, the Company shall not withhold any amount
of the applicable Dividend in respect of U.S. federal income tax.

  



  

(2) _Participation in Common Dividends_. In addition to the Dividends
provided in Section 1, in the event of any dividend or distribution declared
on or paid on the Common Stock (other than a dividend or distribution in
shares of Common Stock that results in an adjustment under Section 3(e)), the
Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Shares, be entitled to such dividends
paid and distributions made to the holders of Common Stock to the same extent
as if such Holders had converted the Preferred Shares into Common Stock
(without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had
held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and
distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made
concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common
Stock.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(3) _Conversion of Preferred Shares_. Preferred Shares shall be convertible
into shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 3.

  



  

(a) _Holder\'s Conversion Right_. At any time or times on or after
the Initial Issuance Date, any Holder shall be entitled to convert any
whole number of Preferred Shares, plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid
Dividends per Preferred Share, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(c) at the Conversion Rate.

  



  

(b) _Conversion_. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of each Preferred Share pursuant to Section 3(a) shall be
determined according to the following formula (the "Conversion Rate"):

  



  

 _Conversion Amount_

  

Conversion Price

  



  

No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of
any Preferred Share, but rather the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

  



  

(c) _Mechanics of Conversion_. The conversion of Preferred Shares
shall be conducted in the following manner:

  



  

(i) _Holder\'s Delivery Requirements_. To convert Preferred Shares into
shares of Common Stock on a date (a "Conversion Date"), the Holder shall (A)
transmit by facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to
11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on such date, a copy of a properly completed
notice of conversion executed by the registered Holder of the Preferred Shares
subject to such conversion in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (the
"Conversion Notice") to the Company and the Company\'s designated transfer
agent (the "Transfer Agent") and (B) surrender to a common carrier for
delivery to the Company as soon as practicable following such date the
original certificates representing the Preferred Shares being converted (or
certificates issued in compliance with the procedures set forth in Section
12) (the "Preferred Stock Certificates").

  



   

2 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) _Company\'s Response_. Upon receipt by the Company of a Conversion
Notice, the Company shall (A) as soon as practicable, but in any event within
one (1) Trading Day, send, via facsimile, a confirmation of receipt of such
Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which
confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process
such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein and (B) on or
before the third (3rd) Trading Day following the date of receipt by the
Company of such Conversion Notice (the "Share Delivery Date"), (X) provided
the Transfer Agent is participating in the The Depository Trust Company
("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the
Holder\'s or its designee\'s balance account with DTC through its Deposit
Withdrawal Agent Commission system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not
participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue
and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a
certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled. If the
number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Stock Certificate(s)
submitted for conversion is greater than the number of Preferred Shares
being converted, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Preferred Stock
Certificate(s) (the "Preferred Stock Delivery Date") and at its own expense,
issue and deliver to the Holder a new Preferred Stock Certificate
representing the number of Preferred Shares not converted. The Person
or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a
conversion of Preferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion
Date.

  



  

(iii) _Record Holder_. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock on the Conversion Date.

  



  

(iv) _Company\'s Failure to Timely Convert_.

  



  

(A) _Cash Damages_. If (x) within three (3) Trading Days after the Company\'s
receipt of the facsimile copy of a Conversion Notice the Company shall fail
to credit a Holder\'s balance account with DTC or issue and deliver a
certificate to such Holder for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such Holder is entitled upon such Holder\'s conversion of Preferred Shares or
(y) within three (3) Trading Days of the Company\'s receipt of a Preferred
Stock Certificate the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a new Preferred
Stock Certificate representing the number of Preferred Shares to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay
additional damages to such Holder for each day after the Share Delivery Date
that such conversion is not timely effected and/or each day after the
Preferred Stock Delivery Date that such Preferred Stock Certificate is not
delivered in an amount equal to one (1.0%) of the product of (I) the sum of
the number of shares of Common Stock not issued to the Holder on or prior to
the Share Delivery Date and to which such Holder is entitled as set forth in
the applicable Conversion Notice and, in the event the Company has failed to
deliver a new Preferred Stock Certificate to the Holder on or prior to the
Preferred Stock Delivery Date, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the Preferred Shares represented by such Preferred Stock
Certificate as of the Preferred Stock Delivery Date and (II) the Closing Sale
Price of the Common Stock on the Share Delivery Date in the case of the
failure to deliver Common Stock, or the Preferred Stock Delivery Date, in the
case of failure to deliver a Preferred Stock Certificate. If any such cash
damages described above are not paid when due in cash, then the amount of
such cash damages shall (unless the Required Holders shall have given notice
to the Company otherwise) automatically accrue and be added to the
Liquidation Preference as of such due date. Nothing herein shall limit a
Holder\'s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at
law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company\'s failure
to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock
upon conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the terms
hereof.

  



   

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(B) _Void Conversion Notice_. If for any reason a Holder has not received
all of the shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled prior to
the fifth (5th) Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date with respect to a
conversion of Preferred Shares, then the Holder, upon written notice to the
Company, with a copy to the Transfer Agent, may void its Conversion Notice
with respect to, and retain or have returned, as the case may be, any
Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Holder\'s
Conversion Notice; provided that the voiding of a Holder\'s Conversion Notice
shall not effect the Company\'s obligations to make any payments which have
accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to Section 3(c)(iv)(A) or
otherwise.

  



  

(v) _Book-Entry_. Upon conversion of Preferred Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Holder thereof shall be required to physically surrender the
certificate representing the Preferred Shares to the Company. In the event
some, but not all of the Preferred Shares represented by a
certificate physically surrendered are converted, the Company shall issue and
deliver to the Holder a new Preferred Stock Certificate representing the
number of Preferred Shares not converted as required by Section 3(c)(ii). The
Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Preferred
Shares so converted and the dates of such conversions. In the event of any
dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Company establishing the number
of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be
controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Each
certificate for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend:

  



  

ANY TRANSFEREE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE
COMPANY\'S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE PREFERRED SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.

  



  

(d) _Taxes_.

  



  

(i) Any and all payments made by the Company hereunder, including any amounts
received on a conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares, must be made
by it without any Tax Deduction, unless required by law. If the Company is
required by applicable law to make a Tax Deduction (or in
connection therewith that there is a change in the applicable law with
respect to rate or the basis of such Tax Deduction), it must notify the
affected Holders promptly.

  



  

(ii) If the Company is required by applicable law to make a Tax Deduction, it
must make the minimum Tax Deduction allowed by such applicable law and must
make any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the
time allowed by such applicable law.

  



  

As soon as practicable after making a Tax Deduction or a payment required in
connection with a Tax Deduction, the Company must deliver to the Holder any

any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made
hereunder or in connection with the execution, delivery, registration or
performance of, or otherwise with respect to, the Preferred Shares ("Other

(iv) The obligations of the Company under this Section 3(d) shall survive any
payment for the Preferred Shares and all other amounts payable hereunder.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments to Conversion Price_. If the Company at any time
after the Initial Issuance Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the
Company at any time after the Initial Issuance Date combines (by combination,

or distribution upon the Common Stock, (II) with respect to any pro rata
subscription offer to holders of Common Stock or (III) for determining rights
to vote with respect to any Reorganization Event or Liquidation Event or (y)
the time such information is made known to the public. 

  



  

(iii) The Company will also give written notice to each Holder on or prior to
the later of (x) at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which
any Reorganization Event or Liquidation Event will take place or (y) the time
such information is made known to the public.

  



  

(4) _Redemption at the Option of the Company_.

  



  

(a) _Option_. If at any time after September 22, 2016, (i) the
Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock listed on the Principal Market
exceeds 175% of the Conversion Price then in effect for a period of thirty
(30) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date and (ii) no Equity Conditions Failure has occurred, the
Company shall have the right to redeem at its option all, but not less than
all, of the Preferred Shares; _provided_ , that (i) the Company may
redeem less than all of the Preferred Shares only upon written consent of the
Required Holders and (ii) the Company may not redeem any Preferred Shares
that the Holders would not be able to convert due to a failure by the Company
to have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock reserved
for issuance upon conversion of Preferred Shares equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock necessary to effect the conversion at the Conversion Rate
with respect to each Preferred Share called for redemption (a
"Company Optional Redemption"). Subject to the consent of the Required
Holders in the preceding sentence, in the event the Company redeems pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above less than all of the Preferred Shares held by the
Holders the Company shall redeem such Preferred Shares on a _pro_ _rata_
basis determined by the aggregate number of Preferred Shares held by each
Holder.

  



   

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) _Redemption Price and Payment_. The Preferred Shares to be
redeemed on the Company Optional Redemption Date pursuant to this Section
4 shall be redeemed by the Company by paying for each such Preferred Share
cash, out of any assets of the Company legally available therefor, in an
amount equal to the Liquidation Preference plus Accrued Dividends as of the
Company Optional Redemption Date (the "Redemption Price").

  



  

(c) _Mechanics of Redemption_. The Company may exercise its right to
require redemption under this Section 4 by delivering an irrevocable written
notice thereof by facsimile and overnight courier to all, but not less than
all, of the Holders (the "Company Optional Redemption Notice" and the date
all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the "Company
Optional Redemption Notice Date"). To the extent the Company, subject to
consent of the Required Holders, did not redeem all of the Preferred Shares
held by the Holders on its initial distribution of the Company Optional
Redemption Notice, the Company may deliver an additional Company Optional
Redemption Notice hereunder (subject to the conditions set forth herein) and
such additional Company Optional Redemption Notice shall also be irrevocable.
The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall state (i) the date on which the
Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the "Company Optional Redemption
Date"), which date shall not be less than thirty (30) Trading Days nor more
than sixty (60) Trading Days following the Company Optional Redemption Notice
Date, (ii) the Redemption Price, (iii) that there has been no Equity
Conditions Failure, and (iv) that the Company has sufficient authorized and
unissued shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
necessary to effect the conversion at the Conversion Rate with respect to
each Preferred Share called for redemption. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 4, at any time prior to the date the Company
Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Preferred Shares subject to
redemption pursuant to a Company Optional Redemption Notice may be converted,
in whole or in part, by the Holders into shares of Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.

  



  

(5) _Protective Redemption_. Prior to any redemption of Preferred Shares
pursuant to paragraph (c) of Article Eleventh of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Protective Redemption Provisions"), the Holders shall
first be given no less than 30 days\' prior written notice (or such lesser
time as to not cause undue jeopardy to the retention or restatement of the
applicable license or franchise (within the meaning of the Certificate of
Incorporation)) prior to the exercise of the Protective Redemption
Provisions, the Preferred Shares subject to redemption under the Protective
Redemption Provisions may be converted, in whole or in part, by the Holder
into shares of Common Stock. To the extent the Board may elect under paragraph
(c) of the Protective Redemption Provisions which Disqualified Holder (as
such term is defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be subject to
redemption by the Company, the Board shall, except to the extent as may be
prohibited by applicable Law, first elect to redeem the Voting Stock of
Disqualified Holders other than the holders of Preferred Shares and Common
Stock issued upon conversion thereof and only in the event that after giving
effect to such redemptions additional redemptions are still necessary to
prevent the loss of or to reinstate the applicable license or franchise which
give rise to the redemptions may the Board thereafter elect to redeem the
Preferred Shares or Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof. In the event
of any redemption of Preferred Shares pursuant to the Protective
Redemption Provisions, the Company shall pay the redemption price in full in
cash, and shall not use any election under paragraph (b) of the Protective
Redemption Provisions to pay any portion of the redemption price in notes or
Redemption Securities (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation). The
foregoing rights are in addition to and not in substitution of the rights of
holders of Voting Stock set forth in the Protective Redemption Provisions.

(6) _Reservation of Shares_. The Company shall at all times have sufficient
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for each of the
Preferred Shares equal to the number of shares of Common Stock necessary to
effect the conversion at the Conversion Rate then in effect with respect to
the Conversion Amount of each such Preferred Share. The Company shall, so long
as any of the Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to
reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversions of the Preferred Shares,
such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be
necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Preferred Shares then
outstanding.

  



  

(7) _Voting Rights_. Each Holder shall be entitled to the whole number of
votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder\'s
Preferred Shares would be convertible on the record date for the vote or
consent of stockholders, and shall otherwise have voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the Common Stock. Each Holder shall
be entitled to receive the same prior notice of any stockholders\' meeting as
is provided to the holders of Common Stock in accordance with the bylaws of
the Company, as well as prior notice of all stockholder actions to be taken by
legally available means in lieu of a meeting, and shall vote as a class with
the holders of Common Stock as if they were a single class of securities upon
any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders, except those matters required
by law or by the terms hereof to be submitted to a class vote of the
Holders of Preferred Shares, in which case the Holders of Preferred Shares
only shall vote as a separate class.

  



  

(8) _Approval Rights_. In addition to any other rights provided by law,
except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number
of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose
or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting
together as a single class, shall be required before the Company may:

  



  

(a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the
Certificate of Incorporation, this Certificate of Designation or the
Company\'s bylaws, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of
designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of
preferred stock of the Company, if such action would adversely alter or
change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or
restrictions provided herein for the benefit of the Preferred Shares; and

  



  

(b) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on
account of the Company\'s Capital Stock of any class junior in rank to the
Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and
payments on the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company,
other than dividends with respect to which the Holders are entitled to
participate pursuant to Section 2.

(9) _Liquidation_. In the event of a Liquidation Event, the Holders shall be
entitled to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company, whether from
capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the
"Liquidation Funds"), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any
of the Capital Stock of the Company of any class junior in rank to the
Preferred Shares in respect of the preferences as to distributions and
payments on the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, an
amount per Preferred Share equal to the Liquidation Preference plus Accrued
Dividends; provided that, if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay
the full amount due to the Holders and holders of shares of other classes or
series of preferred stock of the Company that are of equal rank with the
Preferred Shares as to payments of Liquidation Funds (the "Pari Passu
Shares"), if any, then each Holder and each holder of any such Pari Passu
Shares shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full
amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder as a liquidation
preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designations,
preferences and rights, as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and Pari Passu Shares. After
the foregoing distributions, the Holders shall be entitled, on a _pari
passu _ basis with the holders of the Common Stock and treating for the
purpose thereof all of the Preferred Shares as having been converted into
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3 (without regard to any limitations on
conversion herein or elsewhere), to participate in the distribution of any
remaining assets of the Company to the holders of the outstanding Common
Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall cause such actions to be
taken by any of its Subsidiaries so as to enable, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, the proceeds of a Liquidation Event to be distributed to
the Holders in accordance with this Section 9. All the preferential amounts
to be paid to the Holders under this Section 9 shall be paid or set apart for
payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for, or
the distribution of any Liquidation Funds of the Company to the holders of
shares of other classes or series of preferred stock of the Company junior in
rank to the Preferred Shares in connection with a Liquidation Event as
to which this Section 9 applies. The purchase or redemption by the Company of
stock of any class, in any manner permitted by law, shall not, for the
purposes hereof, be regarded as a Liquidation Event.

  



  

(10) _Reorganization Events_. In the event of:

  



  

(i) any consolidation or merger or other similar business combination
of the Company with or into another Person, in each case pursuant to which
the Common Stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property of
the Company or another Person;

  



  

(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all
or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company, in each case
pursuant to which the Common Stock will receive a distribution of cash,
securities or other property of the Company or another Person;

  



  

(iii) any reclassification of the Common Stock into securities
including securities other than the Common Stock; or

  



  

(iv) any statutory exchange of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
for securities of another Person to the extent not set forth above;

  



   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(each of the foregoing events, a "Reorganization Event"), each Preferred
Share outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without
the consent of Holders, automatically become convertible into the kind and
amount of securities, cash, and other property or assets that a holder (that
was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an Affiliate of such
other party) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion
Rate per Preferred Share prior to such Reorganization Event would have owned
or been entitled to receive upon such Reorganization Event (such securities,
cash, and other property or assets, the "Reference Property"). In the event
that holders of the shares of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the
form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the consideration
that the Holders are entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the types and
amounts of consideration received by the majority of the holders of the
shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. The amount of
Reference Property receivable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares in
accordance with Section 3 shall be determined based upon the Conversion Rate
in effect on such Conversion Date. If the Holders receive only cash in such
Reorganization Event, then for all conversions that occur after the effective
date of such Reorganization Event (x) the consideration due upon
conversion of each Preferred Share shall be solely cash in an amount equal to
the Conversion Rate on the Conversion Date multiplied by the price paid per
share of Common Stock in such Reorganization Event. The above provisions of
this Section 10 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and
the provisions of this Section 10 shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock
of the Company (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock
in any such Reorganization Event.

  



  

(11) _Ranking_. All shares of Common Stock shall be of junior rank to
all Preferred Shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends,
distributions and payments upon Liquidation Event. The rights of the shares
of Common Stock shall be subject to the preferences and relative rights of
the Preferred Shares.

  



  

(12) _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. Upon receipt by the Company of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of any Preferred Stock Certificates
representing the Preferred Shares, and, in the case of loss, theft or
destruction, of an indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in
customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and
cancellation of the Preferred Stock Certificate(s), the Company shall execute
and deliver new preferred stock certificate(s); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Company shall not be obligated to re-issue preferred stock certificates
if the Holder contemporaneously requests the Company to convert such
Preferred Shares into Common Stock.

  



  

(13) _Construction_. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to
be jointly drafted by the Company and the Initial Holder and shall not be
construed against any person as the drafter hereof.

  



  

(14) _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part
of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or
of any other right, power or privilege.

any Preferred Share is registered on the register as the owner and holder
thereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, but in
all events recognizing any properly made transfers.

  



  

(17) _Stockholder Matters_. Any stockholder action, approval or consent
required, desired or otherwise sought by the Company pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the applicable Eligible Market, the DGCL, this
Certificate of Designations or otherwise with respect to the Preferred Shares
may be effected by written consent of the Required Holders or at a duly called
meeting of the Company\'s stockholders, all in accordance with the applicable
rules and regulations of the applicable Eligible Market and the DGCL. This
provision is intended to comply with respect to the Preferred Shares with the
applicable sections of the DGCL permitting stockholder action, approval and
consent affected by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

be, of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as
determined in good faith by the Board. All such determinations shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination
or other similar transaction during the applicable calculation period.
