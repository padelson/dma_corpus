N.A., Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC or Deutsche Bank is acceptable, for the
payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in

 



16   _Section 3.1(b)_. Parent shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the retention and engagement of the Paying Agent.
Immediately prior to the filing of the Merger Filing Documents with the
Cayman Registrar, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and, except as provided in _Section
3.4_, the Dissenting Shares) cash constituting an amount equal to the Total
Merger Consideration (such Total Merger Consideration as deposited with the
Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_, Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i)
held for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares from and after
the Effective Time and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant
to _Section 3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Company
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by
hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (subject to the Companys approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Surrender Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_,
and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the
register of members of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of
Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Except with respect
to Dissenting Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger 

 



17  Consideration into which the Company Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this  _ARTICLE III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of
Book-Entry Shares whose Company Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time
(or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted)
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration. 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former shareholders of the Company six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Company or Parent (as directed by Parent), upon demand, and any such
shareholders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this 
_ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to the Parent or the Surviving
Company (as applicable) for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration
in respect thereof, and Parent or the Surviving Company (as applicable) shall
be responsible for the payment of such amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Company, and any holder of such Certificate who has
not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ with respect thereto shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_ARTICLE III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Company or Parent, as
directed by Parent.

 



18 Section 3.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_.

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 238 of the Companies Law, and who has
delivered to the Company a written objection to the Merger pursuant to Section
238 of the Companies Law (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
3.1(b)_ but instead the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the Companies Law. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 238 of the Companies Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or prosecute or shall have otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his
or her rights under Section 238 of the Companies Law or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 238 of the Companies Law, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 238
of the Companies Law shall cease and such shares shall no longer be considered
Dissenting Shares for purposes hereof and such holders Company Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as
provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Law that are received by the Company
relating to the Company shareholders rights of dissention, and (B) the
opportunity to the extent permitted by Law to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demand for determining the fair value of the
Dissenting Shares under the Companies Law. Except with the prior written
consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to or any demands for appraisal and shall not settle or offer to
settle any such demands.

 

Section 3.5 _Withholdings_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Company Shares, if any, such amounts as Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent. 

 



19 Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the Register of the Company shall be closed, and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Company
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of the Company Shares immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares (other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration
attributable to such Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. If Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each Company Share
formerly represented by such Certificates. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.

Section 3.7 _Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time any outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any share
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to
reflect such share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar
transaction and to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 3.7_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the Companys performance of its obligations
hereunder will (i) subject to, in the case of the Merger, obtaining the
Requisite Shareholder Approval, conflict with or violate the Memorandum
of Association or Articles of Association or the charter or

 



23  bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, PELSA or any of PELSAs Subsidiaries (ii) violate the Companies
Law, (iii) assuming the consents, registrations, filings, notices, approvals

and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition
precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been
satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iv) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any of the Core PELSA Documents any Company Material
Contract, other than, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), any
such conflict, violation, breach, default, right of termination, amendment,
acceleration, cancellation or Lien that has not had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or the Companys performance of its
obligations hereunder will require any consent, approval, authorization,
waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority, except for (i) the filing with the SEC of such reports under the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the filing of the Merger
Filing Documents with the Cayman Registrar and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (iii) any filings required under the rules of NASDAQ
and (iv) such other consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or permits,
filings or notifications, the failure of which to have, make or obtain, as
applicable, has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(c) There is no secured Indebtedness of the Company outstanding that would
give rise to a consent right of a secured creditor under the Companies Law.

Section 4.5 _Permits and Licenses_. The Company, PELSA and each of their
respective Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders necessary for the Company, PELSA and their
respective Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as they are
now being conducted in all material respects (the "Company Permits"), except
where the failure to hold such Company Permits would not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise interfere
in any material respect with the conduct of their respective businesses as
currently conducted. All such Company Permits are, in all material respects,

circumstances or conditions (including entry into this Agreement) providing
grounds for any suspension, revocation, withdrawal, adverse modification or
limitation on any Company Permit. Neither the

 



24  execution nor performance of this Agreement will result in the Company or
any of is Subsidiaries losing the benefit of any Company Permit which it
possessed immediately prior to execution of this Agreement, except any loss
of benefit that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise interfere in any material respect
with the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted.

Section 4.6 _Compliance with Laws_. Except for instances of non-compliance,
default or violation that have not had, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company, PELSA and each of their respective
Subsidiaries has been since March 10, 2011 and is in compliance with, and has
not received written notice of any default or violation of, any Laws
applicable to the Company, PELSA or such Subsidiary or by which any property,
asset or right of the Company or such Subsidiary is bound or affected and (ii)
the Company is in compliance in all respects with the applicable listing,
corporate governance and other rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

any amendments thereto since the date of their filing, the "Company
SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing dates, or, if amended,
superseded or restated after the date of filing, as of the date of the last

and other material correspondence received by the Company from the SEC since
March 10, 2011 and relating to the Company SEC Documents, together with all

or any of its Subsidiaries has failed in any respect to make the

and their consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited

 



25  statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not material in
amounts or significance and the absence of notes) in conformity with GAAP
(except in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or
other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto).

 

(c) Since March 10, 2011, (i) none of the Company, PELSA or any of their
respective Subsidiaries nor any director or officer nor, to the Knowledge of

oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company, PELSA or any of their respective

representation and warranty in _Section 5.3(c)_, there is no anti-takeover
statute or regulation, takeover-related provision in the Memorandum of
Association or the Articles of Association, or stockholder rights plan or

38 ARTICLE V

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the corresponding section of the separate disclosure
schedule which has been delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other representation and warranty set forth in
this _ARTICLE V_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such information is relevant to such other representation and warranty),
Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly incorporated, organized or
formed, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing,
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation
and has the requisite corporate or similar entity power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business, and (to
the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

Section 5.2  _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or similar entity
action of Parent and Merger Sub (and, with respect to Merger Sub, by its sole
shareholder), and no other corporate or similar entity proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (other than, with respect to the consummation of the
Merger, the filing of the Merger Filing Documents with the Cayman Registrar).
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights, and subject to general equitable principles).

 



39 Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or performance of their
obligations hereunder will (i) conflict with or violate the organizational
documents of Parent, (ii) violate the Companies Law, (iii) assuming the
consents, registrations, filings, notices, approvals and authorizations
specified in _Section 5.3(b)_ have been obtained or made and the waiting
periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition precedent to such
consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property
or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound or affected or (iv) result in any
breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any
other Contract or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub
is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any property or asset of
Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment,
acceleration, or cancellation that would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or performance of their
obligations hereunder will require any consent, approval, authorization,
waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority, except for (i) the filing with the SEC of such reports under the
Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the filing of the Merger
Filing Documents with the Cayman Registrar and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company
is qualified to do business and (iii) such other consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, filings or notifications, the failure of which to
have, make or obtain, as applicable, would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub do not
beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any Company Shares or other securities of the Company or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Shares or other
securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities
or otherwise) in, the Company.

 

Section 5.4 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in
writing against either Parent or Merger Sub which seeks to, or would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair
the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

 



40 Section 5.5 _Available Funds_. Parent has or will have sufficient funds to
consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and, at the
Effective Time, Parent will have available, and will make available to Merger
Sub, all of the funds necessary to consummate the Merger.

the authorized share capital of Merger Sub is $50,000 and consists of 50,000
shares, each with a par value $1.00, one of which is validly issued and

and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 5.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub in writing expressly for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall, on the date the Proxy Statement
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to Company

order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty

operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which investigation,
review and analysis was performed by Parent, Merger Sub, their respective

that it, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives have been
provided reasonable access to the personnel, properties, facilities and

warranties of the Company set forth in  _ARTICLE IV_).

representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _ARTICLE V_ , none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any
expense or pay any fee or grant any concession, other than de minimis
expenses, fees or concessions (any such expense, fee or concession, a "Consent

party; provided that the Company shall (x) promptly inform Parent in writing

papers, Tax advice, correspondence with taxing authorities (including any
assessments of Tax)), as Parent may reasonably request and (y) such reasonably
available financial and operating information of the Company, PELSA and their
respective Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide access to, or cause
its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose any information or
documents to the extent that such access would (in the reasonable judgment of
the Company) (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client, work-product or
other doctrine or privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) violate any Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date hereof with respect to confidentiality or privacy, (iii)
materially interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates or (iv) violate any Laws
relating to the exchange of information or otherwise; _provided_ , that in the

attorney client privilege) to permit such access or disclosure; _provided_
_further_ , that in the case of clause (ii) the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain a waiver from the counterparty to any such Contract so
as to allow the Company to provide access to or furnish the relevant
information.

to the Confidentiality Agreement and the parties shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality

authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making
of an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry ( _provided_ , that the
Company shall be entitled substantially contemporaneously with the public
announcement of this Agreement, to waive the "dont ask/dont waive"
provisions of any standstill provisions contained in any confidentiality
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement (such agreement, an
"Existing Confidentiality Agreement"); _provided_ , _further_ ; that the
Company shall notify Parent as to the identity of the other parties to the
Existing Confidentiality Agreements to the extent not prohibited by such
Existing Confidentiality Agreement and, in the event that one or more
Existing Confidentiality Agreements prohibit such notification to Parent, the
waiver of the "dont ask/dont waive" provisions for such Existing
Confidentiality Agreements shall be conditioned upon the party to such
Existing Confidentiality Agreement acknowledging that the Company shall not be
prohibited from notifying the Parent as to the identity of such party), (ii)
other than informing Third Parties of the existence of the provisions
contained in this _Section 6.5_ , engage in negotiations or discussions with,
or furnish any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, any Third Party who has made or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or (iii) resolve or agree to do
any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,

or Acquisition Inquiry and (ii) promptly request that all confidential
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates
to any such Person in connection with such discussions or negotiations be
returned or destroyed.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, if after the date hereof but prior to the time that the Requisite

the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in its good faith
judgment, based on information then available and after consulting with
outside counsel and a nationally recognized third party financial advisor,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Offer, and (iii) after consultation with outside counsel,
the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith that the
failure to take the actions described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) below
would 

 



50  reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to the Approval Time
(A) furnish information to the Person or Persons (and its or their
Representatives and potential financing sources) making such Acquisition
Proposal, but only after such Person or Persons enter into an Acceptable

negotiations with such Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives and
potential financing sources) regarding any such Acquisition Proposal made by

any revisions made to such Acquisition Proposal from the time such discussions
and negotiations permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.5(b)_ shall have
commenced until such time that the Company Board has delivered to Parent a
Notice of Superior Offer with respect to such Acquisition Proposal shall
constitute one and the same Acquisition Proposal) and; _provided_ , that the
Company shall (x) cause the Person making such Acquisition Proposal to waive
any confidentiality or other restriction existing as of the date hereof on the
Companys ability to share information with Parent regarding such Acquisition
Proposal as contemplated by this _Section 6.5_ and (y) give written notice
to Parent after any such determination by the Company Board, in each case
before taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A), (B)
and (C). The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours)
provide Parent with all non-public information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by the Company to a Person or Persons (or its or
their Representatives or potential financing sources) pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence to the extent not previously provided to Parent
or its Representatives.

in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or to
qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board

within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (provided
however that Parent shall only be entitled to request such reaffirmation no
more than three (3) times), (C) fail to recommend, in a

otherwise impede or materially interfere with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (D) requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, the Company to breach the terms of this Agreement. 

 



51 (d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(c)_ or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, at any time before the Approval Time, the Company Board may, if
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with
outside counsel, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under Law (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Circumstance or (y) in response to a Superior
Offer, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement and enter into one or more definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreements with respect to a Superior Offer pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_; provided, that,

 

(i) with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change due to an Intervening

of such period of four Business Days; and

 

(ii) with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Offer, no such Adverse Recommendation Change may be made, and no

unless (A) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ (a "Notice of Superior Offer") (it being understood that the

agreement with respect to such Superior Offer that the Company has received
from the Person that made such Superior Offer (the "Third Party Offeror");
(B) at least four Business Days shall have elapsed following the delivery of
such Notice of Superior Offer (it being agreed that (x) any Third Party
Offeror subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or an Existing
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be permitted pursuant to the terms of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or Existing Confidentiality Agreement or
any waiver granted pursuant to  _Section 6.5(a)_ to make any additional
Acquisition Proposals or modify or amend the financial or other material terms

pursuant to the terms of this _Section 6.5(d)(ii)_ and (y) any amendment to
the financial or other material terms of such Superior Offer made by a Third
Party Offeror not subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or an

during such period of four Business Days (or, if applicable, such two

advisors and outside legal counsel to so negotiate) regarding adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board
to determine not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_; and (D) the Company Board shall
have in good faith taken into account any revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent to the Company by

Shareholder is receiving at least $15.00 per Company Share (and all other
Company Shareholders are entitled to receive an equal or greater amount of
consideration per Company Share) pursuant to any changes to the financial and
other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company pursuant to
this _Section 6.5(d)(ii)_, the Company shall consider such revised terms and
conditions presented by Parent as though the Shareholder were to receive the
same consideration per Company Share as the other Company Shareholders. 

(e) Except to the extent prohibited by any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, the Company shall

Inquiry. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, in any way contract with any Person

_Section 6.5_ by any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company, including a
violation by a Representative of a direction given to a Representative

53 (g) Subject to _Section 6.5(c)_ , nothing contained in this Agreement shall

their respective Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification (and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto)
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as
permitted by the Memorandum of Association or Articles of Association (or such
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement), shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms to the extent permitted by Law. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Indemnitees, and promptly pay or advance any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement by such Indemnitees in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigations, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (x) any act or
omission by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the
Effective Time or (y) the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby or taken at the request of Parent, in either case, (i) in
the case of the Indemnitees who are directors and officers, to the fullest
extent permitted by (A) the Memorandum of Association or Articles of
Association (or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of any
of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement) and
(B) Law and (ii) in the case of the Indemnitiees who are employees, to the
fullest extent required by (A) the Memorandum of Association or Articles
of Association (or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
and (B) Law. For a period of six (6) year from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Law, cause the memorandum of
association, articles of association or other organizational documents of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer,
employee and agent liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnitees
than those set forth in the Memorandum of Association and Articles of
Association and the Companys Subsidiaries organizational documents as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



54 (b) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are
intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors,
heirs or representatives. The Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee
in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.6_.

 

(c) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Memorandum of
Association or Articles of Association (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries), certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Company or under Law. 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that the Surviving Company
or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date hereof
until the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon receiving
Knowledge of (a) any notice, complaint, investigation or hearing (or

Adverse Effect or other similar qualifications contained therein, would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(b) the Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects with
all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if such party has
breached or violated any of its covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder and such breach or violation has been the principal cause of or
directly resulted in (1) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the
obligations of the terminating party to consummate the Merger set forth in

Closing to occur by the Termination Date; or

(ii) any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the

Approval shall not have been obtained; or

 



59 (c) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, individually
or in the aggregate, (x) would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) (A) is not capable of being
cured prior to the Termination Date or (B) is not cured by Parent or Merger
Sub on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) would give rise to the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) (A) is not capable of being
cured prior to the Termination Date or (B) is not cured by the Company on or
before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) the date that is
thirty (30) days following the receipt by the Company of written notice from
Parent of such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

(ii) at any time prior to the date of the Shareholder Meeting, if (A) the
Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the
Company shall have committed an Intentional Breach of any of its obligations

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made and the basis

 



60  therefor described in reasonable detail, and, except as set forth in this
_Section 8.2_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no
effect without liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its
Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall
cease; _provided_ , that if (x) such termination resulted, directly or
indirectly, from the Intentional Breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein or (y) the Intentional Breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
shall cause the Merger Closing not to occur, then, notwithstanding
such termination, such breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all
Damages as a result of such Intentional Breach regardless of whether or not
the Termination Fee has been paid or is payable; _provided_ , _further_ that
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the provisions of _Section 4.24_,
_Section 5.7_, _Section 6.4(b)_ , _Section 6.8_, _ARTICLE I_ , _ARTICLE
VIII_ and _ARTICLE IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If the Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, and (y) (A) the Company receives or
has received an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof
or an Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known at or prior to
such termination, and (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination of
this Agreement, (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition
Proposal described in clause (y)(A)), or (2) an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (y)(A)) is
consummated by the Company, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Parent an amount equal to $15,450,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds on the date of, and as a condition to,
the entry into such definitive agreement or such consummation, as applicable;

 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer immediately prior to
or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; or

(iii) by Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay to
Parent, the Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer within two Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Parents right to obtain the remedy of specific performance contemplated in
_Section 9.9_ in lieu of such Termination Fee, in the event that the
Termination Fee is paid to Parent, except with respect to any Damages payable
as a result of an Intentional Breach of this Agreement, the payment of the
Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective shareholders (other than the Shareholder), former,
current and future directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees for
any Damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the

 



61  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
Law arising out of such breach, termination or failure. Subject to Parent and
Merger Subs ability to recover Damages in respect of an Intentional Breach,
the Termination Fee shall constitute the maximum aggregate liability of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for Damages in connection with this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall (i) Parent or Merger Sub, or any Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Sub, be entitled to obtain both (x) specific performance of
this Agreement resulting in the consummation of the Merger and (y) the
Termination Fee, and (ii) the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee
on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events; _provided_ ,
that the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that Parent shall not be
entitled to receive both the Termination Fee and the Transaction Agreement
Termination Fee.

 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party
for the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
rate per annum three hundred (300) basis points over the "prime rate" (as
announced by JP Morgan or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such
awarded amount was originally required to be paid.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of
directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by
Law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to Law, any party hereto may, without limiting its rights and
remedies under this Agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the proviso of the
first sentence of _Section 8.4_ , waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



62 Section 8.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein
(including  _Section 8.2_ ), all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall
be to an Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit
to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole, including all Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined herein. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. The words "made available to Parent" or words of similar
import refer to documents posted to EDGAR or the Electronic Data Room and
delivered to Parent on CD-ROM at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
date hereof. The specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in _ARTICLE IV_ or _ARTICLE V_ is not intended to imply
that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material for
purposes of this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between or among the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Words describing the
singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, and
words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders.

 



64 Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be
invalid, void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Law in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate
its obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, including
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary, as long as Parent remains
ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective permitted
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
(a) for the rights to receive consideration after the Effective Time under

right of termination or cancellation under, any provision of (i) the

or advisable to consummate, as promptly as practicable, the Purchase and the

foregoing, each of the parties agrees to use its respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Purchase set forth in _ARTICLE V_
to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain any consents,

deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Purchase and
any other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

its Affiliates, or permit Northwest or any of their Subsidiaries (without the
prior consent of Purchaser), to (x) litigate with any Government Body to
obtain approval, authorization or consent to the Purchase, (y) agree to (A)
any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through

20  such entities businesses, assets or properties, (B) the imposition of any

imposition of any impediment (other than a de minimis impediment) on
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Laws
or (z) pay any amounts (other than de minimis amounts) or otherwise agree to
provide any benefit or undertaking to be subject to any limitation or
restriction to any Governmental Body or any other Person in connection with
any approval by a Governmental Body other than in respect of customary and
established filing fees and other payments required as of the date hereof by
Law. 

(b) To the extent not expressly prohibited by Law, Purchaser and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with respect to all discussions, submissions,
negotiations and other communications with all Governmental Bodies in
connection with all waiting periods, authorizations, consents or waivers
(including any post-Closing approvals) required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to reasonable concerns regarding
confidentiality, each party shall keep the other reasonably informed with
respect to such matters. In connection with the actions and procedures
referenced in this  _Section 7.1_, each party shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to: (i) promptly and fully inform the other party of any
written or material oral communication received from or given to any
Governmental Body, (ii) permit the other party to review any submission
required to be made by Northwest or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Body, (iii) consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting, conference or material discussion required by any Governmental Body
and (iv) if permitted to do so by the relevant Governmental Body, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in any such meetings,
conferences and discussions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.1_ shall
require (x) Purchaser to take or (y) Seller to cause Apco to take any action
not required under Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to) as soon as practicable but in no event later than one (1)
calendar week following the Closing Date, take all actions necessary to make
the filings required under the Argentine Antitrust Laws. Upon request by
Purchaser, Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any
applicable consents, authorizations, orders, clearances, and approvals from
all Governmental Bodies required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement. Seller shall
cooperate fully with the Purchaser and its Affiliates and use reasonable best
efforts to promptly seek to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders,
clearances, and approvals (including any post-Closing approvals) and to make
all required registrations, declarations and filings with, and notices to, any
Governmental Bodies (including in connection with any applicable Antirust
Law). To the extent not expressly prohibited by Law, Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser with respect to all discussions, submissions,
negotiations and other communications with all Governmental Bodies in
connection with all authorizations, consents, waivers or approvals (including
any post-Closing approvals) required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and, subject to reasonable concerns
regarding confidentiality, each party shall keep the other reasonably informed
with respect to such matters. In connection with the actions and procedures
referenced in this _Section 7.1_(c), Seller shall, and

Governmental Body, (ii) permit Purchaser to review any submission required to
be made by Seller to any Governmental Body, (iii) consult with Purchaser in
advance of any meeting, conference or material discussion required by any
Governmental Body and (iv) if permitted to do so by the relevant Governmental
Body, give Purchaser the opportunity to attend and participate in any such
meetings, conferences and discussions. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
acknowledges that the Argentine Antitrust Approval shall not be a condition
to Closing and agrees to assume all the risks related to the Argentine
Antitrust Approval (or the lack thereof) and that Seller and its Affiliates
shall not be required to return the Purchase Price in the event the Argentine
Antitrust Approval is delayed, rejected or conditioned (a " _Negative
Antitrust Decision_ "). Purchaser shall be solely responsible to perform any
and all actions required by a Negative Antitrust Decision at its own risk and
cost. Seller and its Affiliates shall not be liable for any losses arising
out of a Negative Antitrust Decision.

7.2 _Third-Party Consents_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Section 7.1_, Purchaser and Seller shall each, and shall each cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents
and approvals of third parties (including parties to Company Material
Contracts (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and other Contracts of Apco and
its Subsidiaries) that are required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Seller, Northwest or
any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay
any fee or grant any concession, other than de minimis expenses, fees
or concessions (any such expense, fee or concession, a " _Consent Fee_ ") in
connection with obtaining any waivers, permits, approval, authorizations,
qualifications or consents that are required in in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the
terms of any Contract to which Seller or Northwest or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ that Seller shall (x) promptly inform

it, Northwest or their respective Subsidiaries and (y) pay any monetary
Consent Fee if Purchaser undertakes to reimburse Seller for amounts paid in
respect of such Consent Fee.

 

7.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Seller shall give prompt written notice
to the Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to Seller,
of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or
failure to occur has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in
the failure to satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the conditions specified
in  _Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.2_, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, notices provided to either party hereto pursuant to Section 9.2 of the
Merger Agreement shall be deemed delivered under this _Section 7.3_. 

7.4 _Non-Solicitation; No Transfer_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller will not, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any bona fide
proposal or offer ( _provided_ , that

 



22  Seller shall be entitled substantially contemporaneously with the public
announcement of the Merger Agreement, to waive the "dont ask/dont waive"
provisions of any standstill provisions contained in any confidentiality
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement (such agreement, an "
_Existing Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ _further_ ; that Seller
shall notify Purchaser as to the identity of the other parties to the
Existing Confidentiality Agreements to the extent not prohibited by such
Existing Confidentiality Agreement and, in the event that one or more Existing
Confidentiality Agreements prohibit such notification to Parent, the waiver
of the "dont ask/dont waive" provisions for such Existing Confidentiality
Agreements shall be conditioned upon the party to such Existing
Confidentiality Agreement acknowledging that Seller shall not be prohibited
from notifying Purchaser as to the identity of such party) concerning, (x) any

cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or any Acquisition Inquiry and (ii) promptly request that all confidential
information provided by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates to
any such Person in connection with such discussions or negotiations be
returned or destroyed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

or Representatives of Apco (including those Representatives of Apco that are
also employees of the Seller) in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5
of the Merger Agreement shall not constitute a breach by Seller of this
_Section 7.4_.

(b) Seller shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after any
director, officer or financial advisor of Seller is notified of the receipt
thereof) advise Purchaser in writing in the event that Seller receives any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and in connection with such
notice, provide to Purchaser the material terms and conditions (including the
identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal) of any such

cause the Target Companies not to, sell, dispose of, transfer, or assign any
ownership interests in any corporation, partnership, limited liability

without the imposition of equitable relief on, or the admission of
wrongdoing by, any Target Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (i) except

enforcement thereof, make or rescind any material Tax election, change any

and validly deliver to the relevant Target Company his or her executed
resignation as a director of such Target Company subject to and effective

7.7 _Public Statements_.

(a) Each party hereto agrees not to issue any press release or make any other

except as may be required by Law, court process or the rules and regulations
of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system,
in which case the other parties hereto shall, to the extent practicable, be
given the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such press
release or other public announcement prior to its public release.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the requirements of
this _Section 7.7_ shall not apply to any disclosure by (a) Seller or
Purchaser of any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions

24 7.8 _Preservation of Records_. Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to
preserve and keep the records held by Purchaser or its Affiliates relating to
the businesses of the Target Companies for a period of five years from the
Closing Date and shall make such records and, as reasonably requested by
Seller, personnel available to Seller, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice and in such a manner as not to materially interfere
with the normal operation of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, as may be
reasonably required by Seller in connection with any insurance claims by,
Legal Proceedings or tax audits against or governmental investigations of
Seller or any of its Affiliates involving the Target Companies or in order to
enable Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and
the Seller Documents. All information obtained by Seller and its Affiliates
pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall be treated confidentially by Seller and
its Affiliates. If Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after that time,
Purchaser shall first give 90-day written notice to Seller and Seller shall
have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to
such party within that 90-day period, to take possession of the records within
180 days after the date of such notice. Seller shall deliver all original
records relating to the businesses of the Target Companies to Apco within 15
days of Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise,
Purchaser shall not be required to provide access to, or cause its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Merger, Apco) to provide access to, or
disclose any information or documents to the extent that such access would (in
the reasonable judgment of Purchaser) (i) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client, work-product or other doctrine or privilege held by the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) violate any Contract of Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof with respect
to confidentiality or privacy, (iii) materially interfere with the conduct of
the business of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
Affiliates or (iv) violate any Laws relating to the exchange of information or
otherwise;  _provided_ , that in the case of clauses (i) and (iv), Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents and take
such other action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other
arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege) to permit such access
or disclosure; _provided_ _further_ , that in the case of clause (ii),
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver from the
counterparty to any such Contract so as to allow Purchaser to provide access
to or furnish the relevant information.

transition and migration to Purchaser of all the information and documentation

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to provide access
to, or cause Apco or Northwest to, or use reasonable best efforts to cause
Apco Argentina to, provide access to, or disclose any information or documents
to the extent that such access would (in the reasonable judgment of the
Seller) (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client, work-product or other
doctrine or privilege held by the Seller or any of Apco, Northwest or Apco
Argentina, (ii) violate any Contract of Seller or any of Apco, Northwest or
Apco Argentina in effect as of the date hereof with respect to
confidentiality or privacy, (iii) materially interfere with the conduct of the
business of Seller or any of Apco, Northwest or Apco Argentina or its or their
Affiliates or (iv) violate any Laws relating to the exchange of information
or otherwise; _provided_ , that in the case of clauses (i) and (iv) each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents and take
such other action (such as the entry into a joint defense agreement or other
arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege) to permit such access
or disclosure; _provided_ _further_ , that in the case of clause (ii) Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver from the counterparty to
any such Contract so as to allow Seller to provide access to or furnish the
relevant information.

 

(b) Upon request by Purchaser, Seller shall negotiate in good faith with
Purchaser regarding an agreement for the provision of services by Purchaser
to Apco and its Subsidiaries following Closing through the later of (i) March

that Purchaser may terminate the agreement prior to such date. The agreement
shall be on substantially similar terms to those set forth in the Amended and
Restated Administrative Services Agreement, dated May 7, 2013, between Apco
and Seller (the " _Administrative Services Agreement_ ") and the compensation
for the provision of such services shall be on the same terms as those set
forth in the Administrative Services Agreement.

Seller certifying that the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ shall
have been satisfied.

7.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. Inclusion of an item in the applicable
Schedules, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not constitute an
acknowledgement or representation that such item is material, shall not
establish any standard of materiality and shall not define further the meaning
of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in the
Schedules

 



26  shall constitute a disclosure only for the purposes of the representation
and warranty that is correspondingly numbered and lettered in the Agreement
and any other numbered and lettered Section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent upon reading the disclosure contained in such
section of the applicable Schedule that such disclosure is responsive to such
other numbered and lettered Section of this Agreement.

 

7.12 _Control of Business_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
its and their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns that the operation of each Target
Company remains in the dominion and control of such Target Company until the
Closing and that none of the foregoing Persons will provide, directly or
indirectly, any directions, orders, advice, aid, assistance or information to
any director, officer or employee of any Target Company, except as
specifically contemplated or permitted by  _ARTICLE VIII_ or as otherwise
consented to in advance by an officer of such Target Company.

7.13 _Conversion_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Conversion of Northwest from a corporation incorporated under the laws of the

(B) a policy (the " _Replacement Insurance Policy_ ") with provisions no less
favorable to APCO and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and employees (the " _Beneficiaries_ ") than to Seller and its
officers, directors and employees. For the six year period immediately
following the Closing, Seller shall continue in full force and effect a
directors and officers liability insurance policy to cover the Directors
and Officers prior service at Apco that is no less favorable to such persons
than any policy covering Sellers directors and officers. Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made) for the benefit of the
Beneficiaries all claims available to it under the Current Insurance Policy or
the Replacement Insurance Policy, as applicable, as promptly as practicable,
and to the extent Seller shall receive proceeds on account of any claims under
any such policy that are applicable to such Beneficiaries, Seller shall pay
such proceeds over to the applicable Beneficiaries promptly following receipt
by Seller of such amounts from the insurer.

 

7.16 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other express provisions of this
Agreement, upon the request of the other party, each of Purchaser and Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to undertake as soon as reasonably

and delivery of) all such other documents, instruments and agreements as may
be reasonably necessary for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either Seller or
Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted

operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or

suit, action or proceeding against it arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which is instituted in any
such court.

not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by any party here
and that the other party would suffer irreparable harm as a result of any such
breach. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to
the parties hereto, each party agrees that the parties shall be entitled,
without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable
relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other
party. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive remedies but shall be
in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to such other
party.

 



29 8.9 _Notices_. Any notice, request, demand, or other communication required or
