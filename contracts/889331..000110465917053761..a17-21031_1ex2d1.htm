with and into Parent (the " _Follow-On Merger_ ", and collectively with the
Initial Merger, the " _Mergers_ "), with Parent continuing as the surviving
corporation in the Follow-On Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Mergers, each outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_
" or " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and
determined that this Agreement and the Mergers are advisable and in the best
interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder;

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into voting
agreements pursuant to which each such stockholder is agreeing, among other
things, on the terms and subject to the conditions of such voting agreement,
to vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
approval of the Mergers and to take certain other actions in furtherance

immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_,
the Fractional Share Cash Amount and dividends pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_,
if any) upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, together with the amounts, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_.

 



 

(ii) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is

automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_
"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation in the Initial
Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of
record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent
thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _DGCL 262_ " and any such shares
meeting the requirement of this sentence, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of
such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood
and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair market value of such Dissenting
Shares to the extent afforded by DGCL 262); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if
any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair market value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or
duplication, the Merger Consideration. " _Proposed Dissenting Shares_ " means
shares of Company Common Stock whose holders provide demands for fair market
value to the Company prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and do not vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with
DGCL 262. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for fair market value of any Company Shares,
of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to DGCL 262 and any
alleged dissenters rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parents
expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Mergers, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon
the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of
fractional shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Initial Merger a
fraction of a share of Parent Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon
surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by
multiplying (i) the Parent Closing Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth of a cent by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time
and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the "
_Fractional Share Cash Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable as part
of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Proration_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be entitled to receive the Cash
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ shall be equal to 50% of the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) (the
" _Maximum Cash Share Number_ ").

 



 

(ii) Promptly (and in any event no later than five Business Days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

 



 

(A) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be
deemed to include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time)
(the " _Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Maximum Cash Share Number, then
all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and Cash Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Maximum Cash
Share Number and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_, whether
fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(B) If the Cash Election Number is less than the Maximum Cash Share Number
(the amount by which the Maximum Cash Share Number exceeds the Cash Election
Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

 



 

(1) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ , whether
fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

 



 

(2) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the
total number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ , whether fractions of Stock Election
Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of such
holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with, and subject to, _Section 2.1(b)_ and _Section 2.2(a)_ (a "
_Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(i) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.2(b)_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (B) the number of
shares of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a
Cash Election.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
including appropriate and customary transmittal materials in such form as
prepared by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Form of
Election_"), so as to permit Holders to exercise their right to make an
Election.

 



 

(iii) Parent (A) shall initially make available and mail the Form of Election
not less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline to
Holders of record as of the Business Day prior to such mailing date, and (B)
following such mailing date, shall use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder who
requests such Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline. The time period
between such mailing date and the Election Deadline is referred to herein as
the " _Election Period_ ".

 



 

(iv) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, during the Election Period, a Form of Election properly
completed and executed (including duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Form of Election) and accompanied by any Certificates representing all
certificated shares to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, as set forth
in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States. As used
herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Parties, " _Election
Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time (in the city in which the principal
office of the Exchange Agent is located) on the date which the Parties shall
agree is as near as practicable to two Business Days preceding the Closing
Date. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release
reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election
Deadline not more than 15 Business Days before, and at least five Business
Days prior to, the Election Deadline.

 



 

(v) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, change or revoke
his, her or its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and executed revised
Form of Election. If any Election is not properly made with respect to any
shares of Company Common Stock (none of Parent, the Company or the Exchange
Agent being under any duty to notify any Holder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common
Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be
Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.

 



 

(vi) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his, her
or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his, her
or its Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates,
previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon

 



      
 

 



 

receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the Parties that
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(vii) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, Parent,
in the exercise of its reasonable, good faith discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any
Holder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the method of
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common
Stock are converted in the Mergers and (C) the method of payment of cash for
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(c) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint Parents transfer agent as exchange agent or another bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in the Mergers
and shall enter into an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ")
relating to the Exchange Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in the Mergers and
the Fractional Share Cash Amount (to the extent determinable) as is necessary
for the payment to holders of Company Common Stock and shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of Parent Common Stock
in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock,
at Parents election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration payable in the Mergers
to holders of Company Common Stock (such cash, book-entry shares and
certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event that the cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of all Cash
Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amounts (including as a result of any
investment of the Exchange Fund), Parent shall promptly deposit additional
funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in
the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Cash
Consideration and Fractional Share Amounts in accordance with this Agreement.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon
demand.

 



 

(e) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such

 



       
 

 



 

other provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount and
any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_.

 



 

(f) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, or any similar
information from the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, such
holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the
Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with
_Section 2.2(g)_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to pay such Merger
Consideration and Fractional Share Cash Amount within five Business Days
following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange
Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. Any dividends
or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_ shall become payable in
accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock
records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid or
issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and Parent that any
applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(g)_.

 



 

(g) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company
Common Stock to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ until such holder shall surrender such share in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_. After the surrender in accordance with
this _Section 2.2_ of a share of Company Common Stock to be converted into
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(i)_, Parent shall cause the
holder thereof to be paid, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is

 



      
 

 



 

entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.
After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to pay on the
applicable payment date the amount of dividends or other distributions on
shares of Company Common Stock that have a record date prior to the Effective
Time and a payment date after the Effective Time, such payment to be made to
the holders of Company Common Stock on such record date.

 



 

(h) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to DGCL 262). From
and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ (together with the Fractional
Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.2(g)_), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent upon Parents demand, and any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_ without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(j) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official if required by
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any other provision
of this Agreement notwithstanding, any portion of the Merger Consideration or
the cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become the

 



      
 

 



 

property of any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.2(i)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Company Stock Options_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted by the Company under a Company Equity Plan (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (a "
_Parent Stock Option_ ") to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (B) the
Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option
_divided by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 2.3(a)_, each such Company Stock Option assumed and converted into a
Parent Stock Option pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same vesting schedule (including any accelerated
vesting terms) and all other terms and conditions as applied to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions and take
such other actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the
Company Stock Options as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all of the obligations of the
Company under the Company Equity Plans, and the number and kind of shares
available for issuance under each Company Equity Plan shall be adjusted to
reflect shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Company Equity Plan.

 



 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event more than five Business Days thereafter), if and to the extent necessary
to cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be registered
and issuable under Parent Stock Options, Parent shall file a post-effective
amendment to the Form S-4 and/or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to Parent Stock Options. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such post-effective
amendment to the Form S-4

 



      
 

 



 

and/or registration statement on Form S-8 (as applicable) for so long as such
Parent Stock Options remain outstanding.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP
that are necessary to provide that: (a) with respect to the offering period in
effect as of the date hereof (the " _Company ESPP Offering Period_ "), no
employee who is not enrolled in the Company ESPP on the date hereof may
participate in the Company ESPP and no participant in the Company ESPP who is
enrolled in the Company ESPP on the date hereof may increase the percentage
amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the
date hereof for the Company ESPP Offering Period; (b) if the Company ESPP
Offering Period ends prior to the Closing Date, then following the purchase of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company ESPP Offering Period, the Company
ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under
the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time; (c) if the Company ESPP Offering
Period has not ended prior to the Closing Date, then any accumulated payroll
deductions under the Company ESPP as of the Closing Date shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (d) in all cases, subject to the consummation of the Mergers, the
Company ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. If at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Company reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Mergers or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, including as necessary or
desirable to secure and perfect full title in the Surviving Corporation to all
Company Owned Intellectual Property, then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors or
managers shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Mergers and to carry out the purposes and intent
of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted
or withheld, and, if required by applicable Law, paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III.**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished since
March 31, 2016 and prior to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures set
forth in any "risk factor" or "forward-looking statements" sections), or (ii)
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior
to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Disclosure Schedule_ ") ( _provided_ that disclosure in any section of such
Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the corresponding section of
this Agreement except to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to
another section or representation is reasonably apparent), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed, and has all necessary
governmental approvals, to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or
licensed, have such approvals and be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Mergers. As of the date of this Agreement, _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all Subsidiaries
of the Company and any joint ventures, partnerships or similar arrangements in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries has any limited liability, partnership
or other equity interest (and the amount and percentage of any such interest),
excluding any passive investment comprising less than five percent of the
outstanding shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests) of any such
person that has publicly traded ownership interests. Other than the Companys
Subsidiaries listed on _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there is no person whose results of operations, cash flows, changes in
shareholders equity or financial position are consolidated in the financial
statements of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement a correct and complete copy of the Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") (collectively, the " _Company
Organizational Documents_ "). The Company Organizational Documents and the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement, limited
liability company agreement or comparable constituent or organizational
documents for each Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the " _Company
Subsidiary Organizational Documents_ ") are in full force and effect and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of
their provisions, except in the case of the Companys Subsidiaries, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be expected to constitute or result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the

 



      
 

 



 

ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Mergers.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 80,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of
business on August 24, 2017 (the " _Company Capitalization Date_ "), (i)
32,610,410 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii)
5,773,341 shares of Company Common Stock were held in treasury, (iii) no

prevent Parent from performing its obligations under this Agreement or
consummating the Mergers.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement a correct and complete copy of Parents Certificate of Incorporation

registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
necessary, under applicable Law,

 



       
 

 



 

for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Mergers, except where the
failure to obtain such consents, orders, licenses, approvals, authorizations
or permits of, or to make such filings, declarations, registrations with or
notifications to, any Governmental Entity, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent the consummation of the Mergers.

 



 

(d) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does
not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the

modification or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a benefit under
any material Contract that is binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries

otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure, that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions

 



      
 

 



 

regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents system of internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2017, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and
Parents independent registered accountant has issued an attestation report
concluding that Parent maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2017. Based on such evaluation, management of Parent
has disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal control over financial
reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to
auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company prior to the date hereof.

respects with all current listing requirements of the Nasdaq.

due) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of Parent, except for (a) Liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries

April 1, 2017 (including any notes thereto), (b) Liabilities incurred under
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Mergers, (c) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since March 30, 2014 have been, in
compliance with all applicable Laws except where such non-compliance has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since March 30, 2014, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) received any written notice or, to
the knowledge of Parent, oral notice from any Governmental Entity regarding
any actual or possible failure to comply with any Law in any material respect

businesses as they are now being conducted and have paid all fees

 



      
 

 



 

and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to have a Parent Permit, to file such documents or to pay such fees
and assessments would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (i) all Parent Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, and to the knowledge of Parent, are not subject to any
administrative or judicial proceeding that would reasonably be expected to
result in any modification, termination or revocation thereof and to the
knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement no suspension or
cancellation of any such Parent Permit is threatened; and (ii) Parent and each

third party to make a Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board of
Directors.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request any

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than one Business Day after its receipt) notify Parent in writing

Takeover Proposal or a request for information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a
Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the
Company Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including an unredacted copy of such Company Takeover Proposal or, where such
Company Takeover Proposal is not in writing, a description of the financial
and other material terms thereof). The

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis,
as to the status of (including any material developments related thereto) such
Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request, shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) provide Parent with any draft agreements
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal and shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) notify Parent of any material modifications to
the financial or other material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(e)_, the Company Board
of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose or announce an intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in either case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or (C) adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the
Company, or publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company, a Company Takeover Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or
agreement in principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.4(c)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, prior to the time that
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board
of Directors may, with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a material breach by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its Representatives of this _Section 5.4_, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 7.1(g)_ (including paying the Company Termination
Fee) in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company
Superior Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking either such action the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel
that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1(g)_, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and has
provided to Parent the identity of the person making such Company Takeover
Proposal, a copy of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreements constituting
such Company Takeover Proposal, and a copy of any financing commitments
relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company,
a written summary of the material terms thereof), (B) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent,
and shall have determined, after consultation with the Companys independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be accepted by the Company and
given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms

 



      
 

 



 

(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other change to the material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new
notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the
four Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above of this
proviso shall instead end at the later of (1) 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the
third Business Day immediately following Parents receipt of such notice and
(2) the end of the original notice period; during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of clauses (B) and (C) above of
this proviso. The actions of the Company Board of Directors in making a
determination that a Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and the Companys authorizing and providing the notices to Parent
required by this _Section 5.4(e)_, if done in accordance with this _Section
5.4(e)_, shall not in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, a violation of this _Section 5.4_ or a termination of
this Agreement. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms.

 



 

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, other than in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company may, at any time
prior to, but not after, the date the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Company Intervening Event if the Company has complied with its obligations
under this _Section 5.4_ and prior to taking such action, the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(i) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action, and specifying the reasons
therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the applicable Company
Intervening Event and (ii) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with the Companys independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law;
provided, that the actions of the Company Board of Directors in making such
determination and the Companys authorizing and providing of such notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not, if done in accordance with
_Section 5.4(f)_, in and of itself, constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, a violation of this _Section 5.4_ or a termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or
otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with
regard to a Company Takeover Proposal; or (ii) directing any person (or the
representative of that person)

 



      
 

 



 

that makes a Company Takeover Proposal to the provisions of this _Section
5.4_; _provided_ that in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) no such action,
position or disclosure that would amount to a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with
_Section 5.4(e)_.

 



 

(h) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.4_ by any
of the Companys Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.4_ by the Company.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause its
Subsidiaries to provide to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") for so long
as such Continuing Employee remains employed by Parent during such period, (i)
a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than that
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) a target quarterly and/or annual cash bonus or commission opportunity, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than that provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation
opportunities and employee benefits (including, without limitation, equity or
equity-based compensation and severance, retirement, health and welfare
benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that
Parent may satisfy its obligation under this _Section 5.5(a)(iii)_ for the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier of (A) the
first anniversary of the Effective Time and (B) December 31, 2018 (the earlier
such date, the " _Benefit Plan Transition Date_ ") by providing employee
benefits on terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those
provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause any Parent Benefit Plans in
which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing Date to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the
Company and its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors) prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other
than benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare
plans) under such Parent Benefit Plans, in each case, to the same extent such
service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under
comparable Company Benefit Plans; _provided_ that such recognition of service
shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with
respect to the same period of service, or (ii) apply for purposes of any
Parent Benefit Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan
that provides medical, dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision insurance
benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first
eligible to participate, Parent shall (A) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with
respect to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) credit each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for an

 



      
 

 



 

amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee in the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is
first eligible to participate in such Parent Benefit Plan, for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited
under comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing not less than fifteen Business Days
before the anticipated Closing Date, the Company Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such other
action as is necessary to terminate any Company Benefit Plan that is a defined
contribution plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event such request is made and
the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, then following the Effective Time and
as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter
from the IRS regarding the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets
thereof shall be distributed to the participants and Parent shall permit the
Continuing Employees who are then actively employed by Parent or a Subsidiary
thereof to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) (excluding loans)
distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to
Parents 401(k) plan.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee or other service provider at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to
(i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan
or any other compensation or employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other compensation or employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 8.13_, nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall create any
third party beneficiary rights in any person other than the Parties, including
any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the Company
or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Mergers, including (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Mergers, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Mergers,
(iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,

 



      
 

 



 

Order, waiting period expiration or approval of, or any exemption by, any
third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR Act
and the clearances and approvals set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers
or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Mergers and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to not take any action after the date of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result
in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any such
Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall jointly devise and implement the strategy for
all filings, notifications, submissions and communications in connection with
any filing, notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of
information, application or similar filing subject to this _Section 5.6_.
Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Mergers and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders,
waiting period expirations or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
5.6_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly consult
with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any
necessary information and assistance as the other Parties may reasonably
request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other
Parties (or their counsel) copies of) all notices, submissions, or filings
made by such Party with any Governmental Entity or any other information
supplied by such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the Mergers. Each Party to this Agreement
shall (A) promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any communication from or
to any Governmental Entity regarding the Mergers, (B) permit the other Parties
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any such
Governmental Entity, and (C) to the extent permitted by any applicable
Governmental Entity, give the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend
and participate in any in-person meetings with such Governmental Entity
regarding the Mergers. If any Party to this Agreement or any Representative of
such Parties receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers, then such
Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly
and after consultation with the other Parties to this Agreement in good faith,
an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request. Each
Party shall furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence,
filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and
the Mergers, and furnish the other Parties with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section 5.6_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the

 



      
 

 



 

information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Anything to the contrary contained
in this _Section 5.6_ notwithstanding, materials provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of Parent, the Company and the Mergers and other confidential
information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 15 Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR Act. In
the event that the Parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the Parties will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request
as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. The
Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be required under any other Antitrust Law.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form, and
(ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Mergers,
which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the Form S-4
complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective for so
long as necessary to complete the Mergers. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the
holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with copies
of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the
other party on any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to
the Form S-4. The foregoing notwithstanding, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or

 



      
 

 



 

mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in advance
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), except to
the extent such disclosures relate to a Company Takeover Proposal. Parent
shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating
thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent
shall also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the
Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this _Section 5.7(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 5.7(a)_. For purposes
of this _Section 5.7_, any information concerning or related to the Company,
its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent
or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and to convene
a meeting of the Companys stockholders to consider the proposal to adopt this
Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(including setting an appropriate record date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting). The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, make the
Company Recommendation, include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, except, in each case, during such time as a
valid Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in effect, and shall not submit
any other proposal (other than, if the Company Stockholder Meeting is also the
Companys annual stockholder meeting, proposals customarily brought in
connection with the Companys annual stockholder meeting) to such holders in
connection with

 



       
 

 



 

the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent.
The foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.7(c)_ notwithstanding, the
Company shall have the right, without the prior consent of Parent, to make one
or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholder
Meeting (A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus required under applicable Law is timely provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors (after consultation with its
outside counsel), in advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) if
required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff or (C) if,
on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present; _provided_ that (1) the duration of any such adjournment or
postponement shall be limited to the minimum duration reasonably necessary to
remedy the circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement; (2)
no single such adjournment or postponement shall be for more than five
Business Days except as may be required by federal securities Laws; and (3) in
the case of clause (C), the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed
to later than the date that is 20 Business Days after the date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written
consent of Parent. All other postponements or adjournments shall require the
prior written consent of Parent. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligations to submit
this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the approval and adoption
thereof.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority,"
"affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or
other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations becomes applicable to
the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (b) if any such Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that
the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Parties shall consult with one another
prior to issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not issue any such public
announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq (in which event
such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to
provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon
such public announcement or statement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto); _provided_ that, (i) each of the Company and Parent may make press
releases or public announcements concerning this Agreement or the Mergers that
consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases
or announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 5.9_ and (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

each of the Company and Parent may make any public statements in response to
questions by the press, analysts, investors or analysts or those participating
in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such statements consist
solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent and/or the Company in
compliance with this _Section 5.9_. The Company shall not be required to
provide any review or comment to Parent regarding any statement, release or
disclosure in response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Takeover Proposal, its consideration of making or its making of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any matters related thereto, and
following any public statement, release or disclosure by the Company in
respect of any of the foregoing matters, Parent shall not be required to
provide any review or comment to the Company regarding any statement, release
or disclosure made by Parent with respect to such matters. The Company and
Parent agree to issue the previously agreed upon form of joint press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement promptly following the
execution of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall ensure that all rights to indemnification and exculpation
from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and related advancement of expenses now existing in favor of any present
and former director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or
for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when
acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their respective heirs,
executors and administrators, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary
Organizational Documents) as in effect on the date of this Agreement or any
indemnification agreements in existence as of, and disclosed to Parent prior
to, the date hereof, shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. The foregoing
notwithstanding, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Company Indemnified Party with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities and advancement of
expenses referenced in the preceding sentence shall continue in effect until
the final disposition of such claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Company Indemnified Party against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of the fact that such person was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other fiduciary in any
entity, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the
request or for the benefit of the Company and pertaining to matters existing
or occurring or actions or omissions taken prior to or at the Effective Time,
including with respect to this Agreement and the Mergers, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under this _Section
5.10_ or otherwise.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred
or are alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent, may (and
at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence;
_provided_ that if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy
with the maximum coverage available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving entity or transferee of such assets,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.10_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
5.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents
(or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under applicable Law. The
provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any Partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree

operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and

resulting from the Mergers by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company

full outstanding amount then outstanding, along with accrued interest thereon
and all fees and other obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries accrued
under the Revolving Credit Agreement or the Loan Agreement, as applicable, (b)
contain payment instructions and (c) evidence the satisfaction, release and
discharge of the debt and liabilities under the Revolving Credit Agreement or
the Loan Agreement, as applicable, and the agreement by the lenders thereunder
(or their agent) to release all liens upon the payment of such amount in

authorization to file UCC termination statements upon such payment, executed
terminations and releases of any outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably
necessary to release such liens. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall
cause all outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and
Loan Agreement to be repaid in full, and the Company shall deliver evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of such repayment and of the satisfaction,

that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to

respective Subsidiaries not to) take or fail to take any action which action
(or failure to act) could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts and will cooperate with one another to obtain the
opinions of counsel referred to in _Section 6.2(c)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_. In
connection therewith, (a) Parent shall deliver to each such counsel a duly

merger of the Company with and into a wholly owned disregarded limited
liability company subsidiary of Parent, if and to the extent requested by
Parent, and Company agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as
Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect
to the Companys stockholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the
Closing to be materially delayed or cause any condition of the Closing to fail
to be met.

extended to May 28, 2018 (the " _Outside End Date_ ") and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action or failure

in the Effective Time not occurring prior to the End Date;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered or issued a final and nonappealable Order that
remains in effect or shall have adopted or enacted a Law that is final and
nonappealable and remains in effect, in either case that permanently
restrains, enjoins or makes illegal the consummation of the Mergers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a Party if such Order (or such
Order becoming final and nonappealable) was due to the material breach by such
Party of any covenant or other agreement of such Party set forth in this

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall
not have been obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting or at any

covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach would
result in the conditions in _Article VI_ not being satisfied and (ii) which
breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured

if the Company has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the
conditions in _Article VI_ not being satisfied; and (ii) which breach,
failure to perform or inaccuracy is either not curable or is not cured by the
earlier of (A) the End Date and (B) the date that is 30 Business Days
following written notice from Parent to the Company describing such breach or

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_;

 



 

(g) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in accordance with _Section 5.4_ in order to accept a Company Superior
Proposal, subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the Company

(h) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, at any

_Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII _shall survive any termination), and there
shall be no other Liability on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to the other except (i) as provided
in _Section 7.3_ or (ii) Liability arising out of or resulting from fraud or
any Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to
termination (in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights
and remedies available at law or in equity).

 



 

Section 7.3 _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ (and at the End Date all of the conditions to the Companys
obligations to close other than receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
have been satisfied, or are capable of satisfaction had the Closing occurred
on the End Date), _Section 7.1(d)_ or _Section 7.1(f)_ (arising from a
Willful Breach of the Companys covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement), (ii) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or publicly disclosed after the date of this Agreement and prior to
(A) the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ ),
(B) the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ ) or (C) the date of the breach giving rise to such
termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_
(arising from a Willful Breach of the Companys covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement)), and was not definitively withdrawn at least three
Business Days prior to (X) the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)_), (Y) the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_) or (Z) the date of the breach
giving rise to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ (arising from a Willful Breach of the Companys

 



       
 

 



 

covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement)) and (iii) at any time on
or prior to the date that is 12 months following the date of such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, a transaction included within the definition of a
Company Takeover Proposal with any Person (a " _Company Takeover Transaction_
"), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company
Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in
immediately available funds, upon the earlier of entering into such definitive
agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Transaction and the
consummation of any Company Takeover Transaction; _provided_ that for the
purposes of clause (iii) only, all references in the definition of Company
Takeover Proposal to "25%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(b) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee,
by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available
funds, within three Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company
Termination Fee immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a condition
to the effectiveness of, such termination.

 



 

(d) " _Company Termination Fee_ " shall mean $28,500,000, in cash. Anything to
the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, if the Company Termination Fee
shall become due and payable in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, from and
after such termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee in full
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, the Company and its
Affiliates and Representatives (in the case of a payment of the Company
Termination Fee by the Company) shall have no further Liability of any kind
for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination
contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section 7.3_, except
in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement. Each of the
Parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not intended to be a
penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is
due and payable and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Mergers, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent be
entitled to more than one payment of the Company Termination Fee in connection
with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which such Company
Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and
Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
_Section 8.5_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this
_Section 7.3_, under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be
permitted or entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee (if entitled
under this _Section 7.3_) if the Mergers are consummated.

 



 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the Mergers, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a

 



      
 

 



 

timely manner any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, then (i) the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions
or proceedings commenced, and (ii) the Company shall pay or cause to be paid
to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
