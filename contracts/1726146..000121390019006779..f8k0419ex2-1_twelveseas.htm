BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT

  



  

This Business Combination Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of April 15, 2019 by and among (i) Twelve Seas Investment
Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (together with its successors, "
_Purchaser_ "), (ii) Brooge Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted
company (" _Pubco_ "), (iii) Brooge Merger Sub Limited, a Cayman Islands
exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (" _Merger Sub_ " _)_
, (iv) Brooge Petroleum And Gas Investment Company FZE, a company formed
under the laws of the Fujairah Free Zone, UAE (the " _Company_ "), and (v)
each of the holders of the Company's outstanding capital shares that
become parties to this Agreement by executing and delivering to Purchaser,
Pubco and the Company a Joinder (as defined below) (each a " _Seller_ ").
Purchaser, Pubco, Merger Sub, the Company and the Sellers are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and, collectively, as the "
_Parties_ ".

  



  

RECITALS:

  



  

A. The Company, directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries, engages in
the business of providing oil storage and related services; 

  



  

B. Each of Pubco and Merger Sub is a newly-incorporated Cayman Islands
exempted company, with Pubco being owned entirely by an officer of the
Company who is not a U.S. citizen or resident and with Merger Sub being owned
entirely by Pubco;

  



  

C. The Parties desire and intend to effect a business combination transaction
whereby (a) Purchaser will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Purchaser
continuing as the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "), as a result of which,
(i) Purchaser shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco and (ii) each
issued and outstanding security of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined below) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, in exchange for the right of the holder thereof
to receive a substantially equivalent security of Pubco, and (b) Pubco will
acquire all of the issued and outstanding Company Ordinary Shares from the
Sellers in exchange for ordinary shares of Pubco (the " _Share Exchange_
" and, together with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), all upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Cayman Act (as defined herein);

  



  

D. After the execution of this Agreement on the date hereof by Purchaser,
Pubco, Merger Sub and the Company, each shareholder of the Company will
become a party to this Agreement as a Seller by executing and delivering to
Purchaser, Pubco and the Company a joinder to this Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company (each, a "
_Joinder_ ") (and for the avoidance of doubt, if there is only one
shareholder of the Company, any reference herein to the Sellers shall
mean such sole shareholder);

  



  

E. The boards of directors of Purchaser, Pubco, Merger Sub and the Company
have each (i) determined that the Transactions are fair, advisable and in the
best interests of their respective companies and security holders, and (ii)
approved this Agreement and the Transactions, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein; and

  



  

F. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser's sponsor,
Twelve Seas Sponsors I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Sponsor_ "), Gregory Stoupnitzky and Suneel G. Kaji (collectively with the
Sponsor, the " _Initial Purchaser Shareholders_ ") have entered into a letter
agreement with Purchaser, Pubco and the Company (the " _Founder Share Letter_
"), a copy of which is attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto, pursuant to which the
Initial Purchaser Shareholders have agreed effective upon the Closing (as
defined herein), on a pro rata basis amongst the Initial Purchaser
Shareholders based on the number of Founder Shares owned by each of them, to
(i) forfeit twenty percent (20%) of the Founder Shares owned by the Initial
Purchaser Shareholders and (ii) subject thirty percent (30%) of the Founder
Shares owned by the Initial Purchaser Shareholders (including any Pubco
Ordinary Shares issued in exchange therefor in the Merger) to potential
vesting and forfeiture obligations that are substantially identical to those
that apply to the Escrow Shares under Section 2.5 hereof.

F. Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Article XII_ hereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  _MERGER_

  



  

1.1   _Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Cayman Act, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall consummate the
Merger, pursuant to which Purchaser shall be merged with and into Merger Sub
with Purchaser being the surviving entity, following which the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Purchaser shall continue as
the surviving company. Purchaser, as the surviving corporation after the
Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ "
(provided, that references to Purchaser for periods after the Effective Time
shall include the Surviving Company). The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Cayman Act.

  



  

1.2   _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Merger Sub and Purchaser shall
execute a plan of merger in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser and the Company (the " _Plan of Merger_ "), and the Parties shall
file the Plan of Merger and such other documents as required by the Cayman
Act with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands as provided in
Section 233 of the Cayman Act. The Merger shall become effective at the time
on the Closing Date when the Plan of Merger is registered by the Registrar of
Companies of the Cayman Islands (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.3   _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the Cayman Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities,
duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser shall become the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Surviving Company (including all rights and
obligations with respect to the Trust Account), which shall include the
assumption by the Surviving Company of any and all agreements, covenants,
duties and obligations of Merger Sub and Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement to be performed after the Effective Time.

  



  

1.4   _Organizational Documents of Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall adopt new memorandum and articles of association
(the " _Surviving Company Charter_ ") which are substantially in the form
of the memorandum and articles of association of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the memorandum and articles of
association of the Surviving Company; provided, that at the Effective Time,
(a) references therein to the name of the Surviving Company shall be amended
to be such name as reasonably determined by the Company, and (b) references
therein to the authorized share capital of the Surviving Company shall be
amended to refer to the authorized share capital of the Surviving Company as
approved in the Plan of Merger, if necessary.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

1.5   _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective
Time, the board of directors and executive officers of the Surviving Company
shall be the board of directors and executive officers of Pubco, after giving
effect to _Section 7.14_ , each to hold office in accordance with the
Surviving Company Charter until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

  



  

1.6   _Effect of Merger on Issued Securities of Purchaser_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party
or the holders of securities of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a)   _Purchaser Units_. At the Effective Time, every issued and outstanding
Purchaser Unit shall be automatically detached and the holder thereof shall
be deemed to hold one Purchaser Ordinary Share, one Purchaser Warrant and one
Purchaser Right in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchaser
Unit, which underlying Purchaser Securities shall be converted in accordance
with the applicable terms of this _Section 1.6_ below.

  



  

(b)   _Purchaser Ordinary Shares_. At the Effective Time, every issued and
outstanding Purchaser Ordinary Share (other than those described in _Section
1.6(e)_ below) shall be converted automatically into one Pubco Ordinary Share,
following which, all Purchaser Ordinary Shares shall cease to be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist. The holders of
certificates previously evidencing Purchaser Ordinary Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except as provided herein or by Law. Each certificate
previously evidencing Purchaser Ordinary Shares shall be exchanged for a
certificate (if requested) representing the same number of Pubco Ordinary
Shares upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section
1.7_. Each certificate formerly representing Purchaser Ordinary Shares (other
those described in _Section 1.6(e)_ below) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the same number of Pubco Ordinary Shares.

  



  

(c)   _Purchaser Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Purchaser
Public Warrant shall be converted into one Pubco Public Warrant and each
outstanding Purchaser Private Warrant shall be converted into one Pubco
Private Warrant. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser Warrants shall cease to
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist. Each of the Pubco Public Warrants shall have, and be subject to,
substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the Purchaser Public
Warrants, and each of the Pubco Private Warrants shall have, and be subject
to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the Purchaser
Private Warrants, except that in each case they shall represent the right to
acquire Pubco Ordinary Shares in lieu of Purchaser Ordinary Shares. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Pubco shall take all corporate action necessary
to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so
long as any of the Pubco Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of
Pubco Ordinary Shares for delivery upon the exercise of such Pubco Warrants.

  



  

(d)   _Purchaser Rights_. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding
Purchaser Right shall be automatically converted into the number of Pubco
Ordinary Shares that would have been received by the holder thereof if the
Purchaser Right had been converted upon the consummation of a Business
Combination in accordance with Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the IPO
Prospectus and the Rights Agreement into Purchaser Ordinary Shares, but for
such purposes treating it as if such Business Combination had occurred
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Purchaser Ordinary Shares
issued upon conversion of the Purchaser Rights had then automatically been
converted into Pubco Ordinary Shares in accordance with _Section 1.6(b)_
above. At the Effective Time, the Purchaser Rights shall cease to be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist. The holders of certificates previously evidencing Purchaser Rights
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Purchaser Rights, except as provided herein or by
Law. Each certificate formerly representing Purchaser Rights shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive Pubco Ordinary Shares as set forth herein.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(e)   _Cancellation of Capital Shares Owned by Purchaser_. At the Effective
Time, if there are any capital shares of Purchaser that are owned by
Purchaser as treasury shares, such shares shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(f)   _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for securities of
Purchaser is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Purchaser or any agent designated by it any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for securities of Purchaser in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Purchaser or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(g)   _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 1.6_ , none of the Surviving Company, Pubco or any Party hereto
shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

  



  

1.7   _Effect of Merger on Merger Sub and Pubco Capital Shares_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holders of any capital shares of Purchaser, Pubco or Merger
Sub: (a) all of the Merger Sub Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an equal
number of ordinary shares of the Surviving Company, with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding share capital of the Surviving Company; and (b) all of the
shares of Pubco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
payment therefor.

  



  

1.8   _Surrender of Purchaser Certificates_. All securities issued upon the
surrender of Purchaser Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such securities, provided that any restrictions on the sale and transfer of
Purchaser Securities shall also apply to the Pubco Securities so issued in
exchange.

  



  

1.9   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Purchaser Certificates_. In the event any
certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Pubco shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the
case may be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such securities, as may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ;
_provided_ , however, that the Surviving Company may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Company with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.10   _Tax Consequences_. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger and Share Exchange, taken
together, are intended to qualify as exchanges described in Section 351 of the
Code. The Parties hereby agree to file all Tax and other informational
returns on a basis consistent with such characterization. Each of the Parties
acknowledge and agree that each (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own
Taxes, including any adverse Tax consequences that may result if the Merger
and the Share Exchange, taken together, does not qualify under Section 351 of
the Code.

  



   

4

 



    



   

1.11   _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Purchaser and Merger Sub, the officers and directors
of Purchaser and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective entities to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  



  

Article II 
  _SHARE EXCHANGE_

  



  

2.1   _Exchange of Company Ordinary Shares_. At the Closing, and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Pubco, and Pubco shall purchase,
acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding
Company Ordinary Shares (collectively, the " _Purchased Shares_ "), free and
clear of all Liens (other than potential restrictions on resale under
applicable securities Laws). At or prior to the Closing, the Company will
terminate any issued and outstanding Company Convertible Securities, without
any consideration, payment or Liability therefor.

  



  

2.2   _Exchange Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in full
payment for the Purchased Shares, at the Closing, Pubco shall issue and
deliver to the Sellers a number of Pubco Ordinary Shares (the " _Exchange
Shares_ ") equal to (i) 100,000,000 Pubco Ordinary Shares less, (ii) if the
Cash Election is made in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ below, a number of
Pubco Ordinary Shares equal to the Cash Election Amount divided by the
Redemption Price; provided, that 20,000,000 of the Exchange Shares otherwise
issuable to the Sellers at the Closing (together with any equity securities
paid as dividends or distributions with respect to such shares or into which
such shares are exchanged or converted, the " _Escrow Shares_ ") shall
instead be issued and delivered to the Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (or such other escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
the Company from time to time), as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "),
at the Closing. The Exchange Shares issuable to the Sellers at the Closing
after deducting the Escrow Shares may be referred to herein as the " _Closing
Exchange Shares_ ".

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall have
the right, at the sole election of the Company (the " _Cash Election_ "), to
receive a portion of the consideration for the Purchased Shares in the form of
U.S. dollars. If the Cash Election is made, the Company may elect for the
Sellers to have the right to receive at the Closing as cash consideration in
lieu of shares of Pubco Ordinary Shares as Closing Exchange Shares (the "
_Cash Consideration_ ") an amount not to exceed forty percent (40%) of the
Closing Net Cash (such cash amount as elected by the Company, the "
_Cash Election Amount_ "). In order to exercise its rights under this
_Section 2.2(b)_ , the Company must provide written notice (the " _Cash
Election Notice_ ") of the Cash Election to Purchaser and the Sellers at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, which Cash Election Notice must
include the Cash Election Amount (provided, that if the Cash Election Amount
in the Cash Election Notice exceeds forty percent (40%) of the Closing Net
Cash, the Cash Election Amount shall automatically be reduced at the Closing
to an amount equal to forty percent (40%) of the Closing Net Cash). Each
Seller must then, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing, provide
written notice (a " _Seller Cash Election Notice_ ") to the Company and the
Purchaser of (i) the amount of such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Cash
Election Amount that such Seller desires to receive as Cash Consideration
(the " _Seller Cash Amount_ ") (provided, that if the Seller Cash Amount as
elected by such Seller exceeds the product of (A) such Seller's Pro Rata
Share, multiplied by (B) forty percent (40%) of the Closing Net Cash, the
Seller Cash Amount for such Seller shall automatically be reduced at the
Closing to an amount equal to the product of (A) such Seller's Pro Rata
Share, multiplied by (B) forty percent (40%) of the Closing Net Cash), and
(ii) wire instructions for such Seller for the payment of the Cash
Consideration. If a Seller fails to deliver a Seller Cash Election Notice to
Purchaser and the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing,
such Seller shall be deemed to have elected to receive no Cash Consideration.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Cash Election shall solely reduce the number
of Closing Exchange Shares to be issued at the Closing, and shall not affect
the number of Escrow Shares to be issued.

(c)   Except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ , each Seller shall receive its
pro rata share of the Closing Exchange Shares, the Escrow Shares and any
other Escrow Property (to the extent released from the Escrow Account to the
Sellers in accordance with  _Section 2.5_ and the Escrow Agreement), and any
Cash Consideration based on the percentage of Purchased Shares owned by such
Seller as compared to the total number of Purchased Shares owned by all
Sellers (such Seller's " _Pro Rata Share_ ").

  



  

2.3   _Surrender of Company Ordinary Shares and Disbursement of Exchange
Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  At the Closing, Pubco shall cause (i) the Closing Exchange Shares to be
issued to the Sellers in exchange for their Company Ordinary Shares, in each
case in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Share (less the Seller Cash
Amount elected by such Seller), (ii) the Escrow Shares to be issued to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 2.5_ , and (iii) the Cash
Consideration, if any, to be delivered to the Sellers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to the wire instructions included in the
Seller Cash Election Notice.

  



  

(b)  At the Closing, each Seller will deliver to Pubco their Company Ordinary
Shares, including any certificates representing Company Ordinary Shares ("
_Company Certificates_ "), along with applicable share power or transfer forms
reasonably acceptable to Pubco. In the event that any Company Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in lieu of delivery of a Company
Certificate to Pubco, the Seller may instead deliver to Pubco an affidavit of
lost certificate and indemnity of loss in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Pubco (a " _Lost Certificate Affidavit_ "), which at
the reasonable discretion of Pubco may include a requirement that the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Pubco or the Company with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares
represented by the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction
of a Pubco Ordinary Share will be issued by Pubco by virtue of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a Pubco Ordinary Share (after aggregating all
fractional Pubco Ordinary Shares that would otherwise be received by such
Person) shall instead have the number of Pubco Ordinary Shares issued to such
Person rounded up in the aggregate to the nearest whole Pubco Ordinary Share.

  



  

2.4   _Company Shareholder Consent_. Each Seller, as a shareholder of the
Company, effective upon the execution and delivery of a Joinder to Purchaser,
Pubco and the Company, hereby approves, authorizes and consents to the
Company's execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which it is or is required to be a party or otherwise bound, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the consents set forth
herein are intended and shall constitute such consent of the Sellers as may be
required (and shall, if applicable, operate as a written shareholder
resolution of the Company) pursuant to the Company Organizational
Documents, any other agreement in respect of the Company to which any Seller
is a party or bound and all applicable Laws.

2.5   _Share Escrow_.

  



  

(a)   _Escrow_. On or prior to April 30, 2019 (or such later date prior to
the Closing as mutually agreed by Purchaser and the Company), Pubco, the
Sellers and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an Escrow Agreement, effective
as of the Closing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, the Sellers and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which Pubco shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Shares to be held,
along with any other dividends, distributions or other income on the Escrow
Shares (together with the Escrow Shares, the " _Escrow Property_ "), in
a segregated escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and disbursed
therefrom in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Property shall be allocated among and transferred to the Sellers pro
rata based on their respective Pro Rata Shares. Amongst other things, the
Escrow Agreement shall permit the Sellers after the Closing to (i) pledge
their Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Property as collateral security for
documented loans entered into by such Sellers, Pubco or its Subsidiaries,
including the Company, after the Closing or (ii) transfer their rights to
their Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Property to a third party, provided, that
(A) in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), that the lender's or
transferee's rights to any such pledged or transferred Escrow Property shall
be subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.5_ , including the forfeiture
provisions herein, and the Escrow Agreement, and such lender or transferee
must acknowledge such in writing to Pubco and the Escrow Agent prior to the
granting of any such pledge or the making of any such transfer; and (B) in
event of a pledge under clause (i), such Seller may transfer such Escrow
Property, including physical possession of documentation evidencing a
Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Property (including a share certificate
or book entry, if any), to another escrow agent (including one affiliated
with such lender), as selected by such Seller and reasonably acceptable to a
Disinterested Independent Director Majority, to hold the Escrow Property in a
segregated escrow account on the same terms and conditions as the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement is required to hold such Escrow Property
(other than adjustments to the fees and expenses of such escrow agent as
reasonably acceptable to a Disinterested Independent Director Majority).

  



  

(b)   _Other Escrow Terms._ The Parties agree that:

  



  

(i)  the Escrow Property shall be held in the Escrow Account and will only
become vested and not subject to forfeiture, and released to the Sellers, in
the event that Pubco meets certain minimum performance or milestone
requirements as shall be mutually agreed to by Purchaser, the Sellers and the
Company and set forth in the Escrow Agreement (the " _Milestones_ ");

  



  

(ii)  the period for Pubco to satisfy such Milestones will commence with the
first full fiscal quarter beginning after the Closing Date and finish at the
end of the twentieth (20th) fiscal quarter after such commencement date (such
period, the " _Escrow Period_ "); and

  



  

(iii)  all other conditions not documented in this Agreement and relating to
the Escrow Property and Escrow Account (including, for example, the
applicable Milestones, the portion of the Escrow Property to be released at
any one time for the satisfaction of a Milestone, the preparation of any
statements regarding the calculation or satisfaction of a Milestone and the
decision-making processes involved for the determination of the satisfaction
of a Milestone and related release of such Escrow Property) will be further
elaborated or documented in the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(c)   _Forfeiture_. At the end of the Escrow Period, if there is any Escrow
Property which has not vested and the Sellers are not entitled to receive in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_ and the Escrow Agreement, such Escrow
Property will be forfeited by the Sellers and distributed to Pubco from the
Escrow Account, and promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) after a final determination pursuant to the Escrow Agreement that at
the end of the Escrow Period there is such Escrow Property which has not
vested and to which the Sellers are not entitled to receive, Pubco and the
Sellers will provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release and surrender any remaining Escrow Property to Pubco. Pubco will
cancel any Escrow Shares distributed to Pubco from the Escrow Account
promptly after its receipt thereof and cancel any accrued but unpaid dividends
payable in respect of such Escrow Shares. Each Seller, effective upon the
execution and delivery of a Joinder to Purchaser, Pubco and the
Company, acknowledges that such Seller's right to receive the Escrow Shares
and the other Escrow Property is contingent on the performance of Pubco and
its Subsidiaries during the Escrow Period as set forth in this _Section 2.5_
and the Escrow Agreement, and that if the requirements for the vesting and
release of the Escrow Property to the Sellers as set forth in this _Section
2.5_  and the Escrow Agreement are not met in accordance with the terms
hereof and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Shares and the other Escrow
Property will not be paid or delivered to the Sellers, and the Sellers shall
have no right to receive such Escrow Shares or other Escrow Property.

  



  

(d)   _Future Operations_. Following the Closing (including during the Escrow
Period), Pubco and its Subsidiaries, including the Company, will be entitled
to operate their respective businesses based upon the business requirements of
Pubco and its Subsidiaries. Each of Pubco and its Subsidiaries, including the
Company, will be permitted following the Closing (including during the
Escrow Period) to make changes at its sole discretion to its operations,
organization, personnel, accounting practices and other aspects of its
business, including actions that may have an impact on the achievement of the
Milestones for the vesting and release of the Escrow Property to the Sellers,
and the Sellers will have no right to claim the loss of all or any portion of
the Escrow Property or other damages as a result of such decisions; provided
that such actions are not taken or omitted to be taken by Pubco and
its Subsidiaries in bad faith with the primary intent of causing the Sellers
to not achieve the Milestones for the vesting and release of the Escrow
Property to the Sellers as set forth in this _Section 2.5_ and the Escrow
Agreement.

  



  

(e)   _Ownership Rights._ Until and unless the Escrow Shares are forfeited in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_ and the Escrow Agreement, each Seller
shall have full voting rights to its pro rata entitlement of the Escrow
Property.

  



  

(f)   _Fractional Escrow Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in the Escrow Agreement, no fraction of an Escrow Share
will be forfeited or transferred to the Escrow Account by a Seller by virtue
of this _Section 2.5_ , the transactions contemplated hereby or the Escrow
Agreement, and the number of Escrow Shares to be so forfeited or transferred
shall instead be rounded down to the nearest whole Escrow Share.

  



  

(g)   _Founder Shares._ The Parties agree that 30% of the Founder Shares
owned by the Initial Purchaser Shareholders at the Closing (including any
Pubco Ordinary Shares issued in exchange therefor in the Merger) will be
escrowed in substantially identical terms to the Escrow Property under this
_Section 2.5_ and the Escrow Agreement, the exact terms of which are provided
for in the Founder Share Letter, a copy of which is attached as _Exhibit A_
to this Agreement.

applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the receipt of all applicable Consents of
Governmental Authorities) and to comply as promptly as practicable with
all requirements of Governmental Authorities applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 7.9(a)_ , to the extent
required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each Party hereto agrees to make any required filing
or application under Antitrust Laws, as applicable, at such Party's sole cost
and expense, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be reasonably
requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other actions reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable,
including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for
under the Antitrust Laws. Each Party shall, in connection with its efforts to
obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other Party or
its Affiliates in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated
by a private Person; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed of any
communication received by such Party or its Representatives from, or given by

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) permit a Representative of the other Parties and their
respective outside counsel to review any communication given by it to, and

Governmental Authority or other Person, give a Representative or
Representatives of the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; (iv) in the event a
Party's Representative is prohibited from participating in or attending any
meetings or conferences, the other Parties shall keep such Party promptly and
reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (v) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending the
transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive

40

 



    



  

(c)  As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and file with Governmental Authorities requests
for approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to have such Governmental Authorities
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
shall give prompt written notice to the other Parties if such Party or any of
its Representatives (or, with respect to the Company, any Seller) receives
any notice from such Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly furnish the
other Parties with a copy of such Governmental Authority notice. If any
Governmental Authority requires that a hearing or meeting be held in
connection with its approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
prior to the Closing or after the Closing, each Party shall arrange for
Representatives of such Party to be present for such hearing or meeting. If
any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by any applicable Governmental Authority or any
private Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document as violative of any applicable Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections
or Actions so as to timely permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including in order
to resolve such objections or Actions which, in any case if not resolved,
could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. In the event any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private Person challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any Ancillary Document, the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents.

  



  

(d)  Prior to the Closing, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any Consents of Governmental Authorities or other third
Persons as may be necessary for the consummation by such Party or its
Affiliates of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required as
a result of the execution or performance of, or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement by such Party or its Affiliates,
and the other Parties shall provide reasonable cooperation in connection
with such efforts. With respect to Pubco, during the Interim Period, the
Company and Pubco shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to
cause Pubco to qualify as "foreign private issuer" as such term is defined
under Exchange Act Rule 3b-4 and to maintain such status through the Closing
and immediately after the Closing.

  



  

7.10   _Further Assurances_. The Parties hereto shall further cooperate with
each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,

(a)  As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser and Pubco
shall prepare with the reasonable assistance of the Company, and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, and including the Proxy Statement contained therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Pubco Securities to be issued under this Agreement to
the holders of Purchaser Securities prior to the Effective Time, which
Registration Statement will also contain a proxy statement of Purchaser (as
amended, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from Purchaser shareholders for the matters to be acted upon at the Special
Meeting and providing the Public Shareholders an opportunity in accordance
with Purchaser's Organizational Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have
their Purchaser Ordinary Shares (or if after the Effective Time, their Pubco
Ordinary Shares) redeemed (the " _Redemption_ ") in conjunction with the
shareholder vote on the Purchaser Shareholder Approval Matters. The Proxy
Statement shall include proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from Purchaser shareholders to vote, at an extraordinary general meeting of
Purchaser shareholders to be called and held for such purpose (the " _Special
Meeting_ "), in favor of resolutions approving (i) the adoption and approval
of this Agreement and the Transactions (including to the extent required, the
issuance of any PIPE Shares) by the holders of Purchaser Common Shares in
accordance with the Purchaser's Organizational Documents, the Cayman Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, (ii) if mutually agreed by
Purchaser and the Company prior to the filing of the Registration Statement,
the adoption and approval of a new Equity Incentive Plan for Pubco in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, and Purchaser (the "
_Pubco Equity Plan_ "), (iii) the appointment of the members of the Post-
Closing Pubco Board in accordance with _Section 7.14_ hereof, (iv) such other
matters as the Company and Purchaser shall hereafter mutually determine to be
necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Transactions (the approvals
described in foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the "
_Purchaser Shareholder Approval Matters_ "), and (v) the adjournment of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Purchaser. If on the date for which the Special Meeting is scheduled,
Purchaser has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
to obtain the Required Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Purchaser may make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Special Meeting. In connection with the Registration
Statement, Purchaser and Pubco will file with the SEC financial and other
information about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law and applicable proxy solicitation and
registration statement rules set forth in the Purchaser's
Organizational Documents, the Cayman Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC and Nasdaq. Purchaser and Pubco shall cooperate and provide the Company
(and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to
filing the same with the SEC. The Company shall provide Purchaser and Pubco
with such information concerning the Company and its shareholders, officers,
directors, employees, assets, Liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise), business and operations that may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, which information provided by the Company shall be true and correct
and not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading.

  



  

(b)  Purchaser and Pubco shall take any and all reasonable and necessary
actions required to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in connection with the Registration
Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption. Each of Purchaser, Pubco
and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make their
respective directors, officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice,
available to the Company, Pubco, Purchaser and the Sellers and their
respective Representatives in connection with the drafting of the public
filings with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Registration Statement, and responding in a timely
manner to comments from the SEC. Each Party shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Registration Statement (and other
related materials) if and to the extent that such information is determined
to have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Laws. Purchaser and Pubco shall amend or supplement
the Registration Statement and cause the Registration Statement, as so amended
or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
Purchaser's shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
Purchaser's Organizational Documents.

  



  

   

42

 



    



  

(c)  Purchaser and Pubco, with the assistance of the other Parties, shall
promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and shall
otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to "clear" comments from the SEC and become effective. Purchaser
and Pubco shall provide the Company with copies of any written comments, and
shall inform the Company of any material oral comments, that Purchaser, Pubco
or their respective Representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Registration Statement, the Special Meeting and the Redemption
promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a
reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any
proposed written or material oral responses to such comments.

  



  

(d)  As soon as practicable following the Registration Statement "clearing"
comments from the SEC and becoming effective, Purchaser and Pubco shall
distribute the Registration Statement to Purchaser's shareholders and,
pursuant thereto, shall call the Special Meeting in accordance with the
Cayman Act for a date no later than thirty (30) days following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

  



  

(e)  Purchaser and Pubco shall comply with all applicable Laws, any
applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq, Purchaser's
Organizational Documents and this Agreement in the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Registration Statement, any solicitation of
proxies thereunder, the calling and holding of the Special Meeting and the
Redemption.

except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or

description of this Agreement as required by Federal Securities Laws, which
the Company shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not

9.2   _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 9.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination, including the provision of _Section
9.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the part of
any Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i)  _Sections 7.12_, _7.13_
, _9.3_ , _10.1_ , _Article XI_ and this _Section 9.2_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any fraud claim against such
Party, in either case, prior to termination of this Agreement (in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section 10.1_ ). Without limiting
the foregoing, and except as provided in _Sections 9.3_ and this _Section
9.2_ (but subject to _Section 10.1_ , and subject to the right to seek
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with
_Section 11.8_ ), the Parties' sole right prior to the Closing with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement by another Party or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the right, if
applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

  



  

9.3   _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Sections 9.4_ and _10.1_ , all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. As
used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " shall include all out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, financing sources, experts and consultants to a
Party hereto or any of its Affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf
in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document related
hereto and all other matters related to the consummation of this Agreement.
With respect to Purchaser, Expenses shall include any and all deferred
expenses (including fees or commissions payable to the underwriters and any
legal fees) of the IPO upon consummation of a Business Combination, any
Extension Expenses, as well as any costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any PIPE Investment.

9.4   _Termination Fee._

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding _Section 9.3_ above, but subject to _Section 10.1_ , in
the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by either Purchaser or the
Company under _Section 9.1(b)_ and the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Outside Date was not caused by, or a result of, the breach or
violation of the Company, the Sellers, Pubco or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement, or
(ii) there is a valid and effective termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , then Purchaser shall pay to the Company
a termination fee in cash in an aggregate amount equal to the legal and
advisory fee Expenses incurred by the Company prior to such termination, up to
a maximum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). The Termination Fee shall be paid by Purchaser to the
Company (but for the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 10.1_ ) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by the Company within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of the valid
and effective termination of this Agreement by the Company where such payment
is required pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 9.4(a)_ or, if
later, three (3) Business Days after the Company shall have delivered to
Purchaser the amount of such Expenses for the Termination Fee, along with
reasonable documentation in connection therewith.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this
Agreement in circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable under this
_Section 9.4_ , the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the
Company would otherwise be entitled to assert against Purchaser or its
Affiliates or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company, provided, that the
foregoing shall not limit (x) any claim for fraud prior to termination of this
Agreement or (y) the rights of the Company to seek specific performance or
other injunctive relief in lieu of terminating this Agreement.

Article X 
  _WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

  



  

10.1   _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and each Seller hereby
acknowledges that it has read the IPO Prospectus and understands that
Purchaser has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the
IPO and the overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's underwriters and from
certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including
interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of
Purchaser's public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by
Purchaser's underwriters) (including any successors after the Merger, the "
_Public Shareholders_ ") and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO
Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to
the Public Shareholders in the event they elect to redeem their Purchaser
Ordinary Shares (or Pubco Ordinary Shares upon the Merger) in connection with
the consummation of its initial business combination (as such term is used in
the IPO Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an
amendment to Purchaser's Organizational documents to extend Purchaser's
deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public Shareholders
if Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within eighteen (18)
months after the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect to any interest earned
on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any taxes,
and (d) to Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of a
Business Combination. For and in consideration of Purchaser entering into
this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub
and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, Pubco, Merger Sub, or any Seller nor any of their respective
Affiliates do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim
arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this
Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between Purchaser
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Company, Pubco, Merger
Sub, or any Seller or their respective Representatives, on the other hand, or
any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (collectively,
the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and each Seller on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that any such Party or any of its Affiliates may have against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as
a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement
with Purchaser or its Affiliates). The Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and each
Seller each agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material
to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Purchaser and its
Affiliates to induce Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and the Company,
Pubco, Merger Sub and each Seller each further intends and understands such
waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against such Party and each of
its Affiliates under applicable Law. To the extent the Company, Pubco, Merger
Sub or any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates commences any action
or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of
any matter relating to Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against Purchaser or its
Representatives, the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub and the Sellers each hereby
acknowledge and agree that such Party's and its Affiliates' sole remedy shall
be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall
not permit such Party or any of its Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any
of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained
therein. In the event that the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub or any Seller
commences Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of
any matter relating to Purchaser or its Representatives which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or the Public Shareholders, whether in the form of
money damages or injunctive relief, Purchaser and its Representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, Pubco, Merger Sub
and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, the
associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the
event Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such
Action. This _Section 10.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for
any reason.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

10.2   _Non-Recourse and Release_.

  



  

(a)  All claims or Actions (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the other Ancillary Documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents (including any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement or the
other Ancillary Documents), may be made only against (i) the Company, (ii)
Purchaser, (iii) Pubco, (iv) Merger Sub and (v) the Sellers, in their
individual capacities (the " _Liable Parties_ "). No Person, other than the
Liable Parties, including any past, present or future Affiliate of any Seller
or any of their Affiliates' respective past, present or future directors,
officers, employees, incorporators, members, managers, partners, equityholders
(including stockholders and optionholders), Affiliates, agents, attorneys or
representatives (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory
that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the
case may be) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or the
negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and each Party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates.

  



  

(b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Liable Parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, any and all claims,
Actions that they may have against the other Parties or any Non-Party
Affiliates relating to the negotiation or subject matter of this Agreement or
any disclosure schedule or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates, are
hereby irrevocably waived and released. Furthermore, without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, no claim (whether in contract or in
tort, in Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) or Action
shall be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, the Liable Parties against
any Seller, other Party or any Non-Party Affiliate, and no recourse shall be
sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations, or warranties, or covenants or agreements (to the extent
such covenants or agreements contemplate performance prior to the Closing) of
the Sellers or any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement, any
certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or other document delivered
hereunder, the negotiation or subject matter of this Agreement or the
disclosure schedules or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and
each Liable Party waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Seller, Party or Non-Party Affiliate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will relinquish the rights of a
Party after the Closing to enforce the terms of this Agreement that apply
after the Closing in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

(c)  Effective as of the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that owns
any share or other equity interest in or of such Seller (the " _Releasing
Persons_ "), hereby releases and discharges the Company from and against any
and all Actions, obligations, agreements, debts and Liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both at law and in equity, which such
Releasing Person now has, has ever had or may hereafter have against Company
relating to such Seller's capacity as a shareholder of the Company and arising
on or prior to the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, including any rights to
indemnification or reimbursement from the Company, whether pursuant to its
Organizational Documents, Contract or otherwise, and whether or not relating
to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date. From and after the
Closing, each Releasing Person hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any Action, or commencing or causing to be
commenced, any Action of any kind against the Company or its Affiliates,
based upon any matter purported to be released hereby. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the releases and restrictions set forth
herein shall not apply to any claims a Releasing Person may have against any
party pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, subject to the provisions of this _Section 10.2_.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(d)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
_Section 10.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these provisions set forth in this _Section 10.2_
, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement or otherwise agree to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Article XI 
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

11.1   _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by
or on behalf of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the
Closing, and from and after the Closing, the Parties and their respective
Representatives shall not have any further obligations, nor shall any claim be
asserted or action be brought against any of the Parties or their respective
Representatives with respect thereto. The covenants and agreements made by
the Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such covenants or agreements, shall not survive the Closing, except for those
covenants and agreements contained herein and therein that by their terms
apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing (which
such covenants shall survive the Closing and continue until fully performed
in accordance with their terms).

hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
when delivered (i) in person, (ii) by facsimile or other electronic means,

11.3   _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, Pubco, the Company and the Sellers (and, after the
Closing, a Disinterested Independent Director Majority), and any assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_  that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

11.4   _Third Parties_. Except for the rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons
set forth in _Section 7.15_ , which the Parties acknowledge and agree are
express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument or document executed by any party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights
in, or be deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is
not a Party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a
Party.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

11.5   _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other
than applications for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for enforcement
of a resolution under this  _Section 11.5_ ) arising out of, related to, or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a
" _Dispute_ ") shall be governed by this _Section 11.5_. A Party must, in the
first instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other Parties
subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably detailed
description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The Parties involved in
such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis within
ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such
other Parties subject to such Dispute (the " _Resolution Period_ ");
_provided_ , that if any Dispute would reasonably be expected to have
become moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days
after the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no Resolution
Period with respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during
the Resolution Period may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to the then-existing rules and procedures (including any
expedited procedures) of the ICC (the " _ICC Procedures_ "). Any Party
involved in such Dispute may submit the Dispute to the ICC to commence the
proceedings after the Resolution Period. To the extent that the ICC Procedures
and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement shall
control. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator nominated by
the ICC promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
submission of the Dispute to the ICC and reasonably acceptable to each Party
subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with
substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The
arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration
process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his
or her nomination and acceptance by the Parties subject to the Dispute. The
proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide
the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York.
Time is of the essence. Each Party subject to the Dispute shall submit a
proposal for resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20)
days after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The
arbitrator shall have the power to order any Party subject to the Dispute to
do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform its contractual
obligation(s) and providing injunctive and other equitable relief; provided,
that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing
power (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant Party (or
Parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of
the proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a
reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the
other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in London, United Kingdom.
The language of the arbitration shall be English.

  



  

11.6   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without regard
to the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

11.7   _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.7_.

  



  

11.8   _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of
each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique,
recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Parties may have
not adequate remedy at law, and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be
inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such
Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

11.9   _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable,
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

  



  

11.10   _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by execution of a written instrument signed by Purchaser, Pubco, the
Company and the Sellers; provided that any amendment, supplement or
modification of this Agreement after the Closing shall also require the prior
written consent of a Disinterested Independent Director Majority.

  



  

11.11   _Waiver_. Each of Purchaser, Pubco and the Company on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, and the Sellers, may in its sole discretion (i)
extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other non-Affiliated Party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties by any other Party such other non-Affiliated
Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance by such other non-Affiliated Party with any covenant or
condition contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be
bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by a Party
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver of
any provision of this Agreement after the Closing by Pubco or Purchaser shall
also require the prior written consent of a Disinterested Independent Director
Majority.

  



  

11.12   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents or instruments
referred to herein, including any exhibits and schedules attached hereto,
which exhibits and schedules are incorporated herein by reference, together
with the Ancillary Documents, embody the entire agreement and understanding
of the Parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There
are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or
undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein
