Parties shall not individually request the Accounting Firm to, (A)&nbsp;make any determination other than as set forth above, (B)&nbsp;determine any Unresolved Adjustment to be a value higher
than the highest value or lower than the lowest value proposed by the Parties in Buyer&#146;s Initial Closing Statement or Seller&#146;s Notice of Disagreement, (C)&nbsp;undertake any independent investigation of the facts relating to the Unresolved
Adjustments or (D)&nbsp;make any determination of the legal interpretation of this Agreement. The Accounting Firm will be instructed to render, as promptly as practicable and, if at all possible, within 30 days after such submission of the
Unresolved Adjustments to the Accounting Firm, its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it, which written decision will include a worksheet setting forth the reason for each Unresolved Adjustment determination, the material
calculations used to determine the Accounting Firm&#146;s ruling including the calculation of Inventory Book Value and Final Purchase Price, and the allocation of its fees and expenses. The determination of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm
and the statement prepared by the Accounting Firm setting forth such determination will, absent manifest error, be final and binding on the Parties as the Final Inventory Book Value, the Final Purchase Price and the Final Closing Statement,
respectively, and judgment may be entered upon such determination and statement in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.10(c) shall be borne by Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, as determined by the Accounting Firm based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination (before such allocation) bears to the total value of each party&#146;s respective position
in relation to the total amount of the Unresolved Balance. For purposes of illustration only, if the Unresolved Balance is $100, and the written determination of the Accounting Firm states that $80 of the Unresolved Balance is resolved in
Buyer&#146;s favor and $20 of the Unresolved Balance is resolved in Seller&#146;s favor, Buyer would bear 20% of the Accounting Firm&#146;s costs and expenses, on the one hand, and Seller would bear 80% of such costs and expenses, on the other hand.
All other fees, expenses, and costs incurred by a Party or its Representatives in connection with this Section&nbsp;2.10 shall be borne by such Party. </P></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
