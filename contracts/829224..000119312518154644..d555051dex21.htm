Page 16 2.07 Non-assignable Assets.

 



   (a) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to the
provisions of this Section 2.07, to the extent that the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability
would result in a violation of Law, or would require the consent,
authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement), including any
Governmental Authority, and such consent, authorization, approval or waiver
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not
constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof;
_provided that_  subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
contained in Article VII, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the
foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.
Following the Closing, for a period of at least 12 months, Seller and Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each
other, to obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or waiver,
or any release, substitution or amendment required to novate all liabilities
and obligations under any and all Assigned Contracts or other liabilities that
constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the unconditional
release of all parties to such arrangements, so that, in any case, Buyer shall
be solely responsible for such liabilities and obligations from and after the
Closing Date; _provided that_ neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to
pay any consideration therefor. Once such consent, authorization, approval,
waiver, release, substitution or amendment is obtained, Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer the relevant Purchased Asset to
which such consent, authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or
amendment relates for no additional consideration. Applicable sales, transfer
and other similar Taxes in connection with such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or license shall be paid by Buyer in accordance with Section 6.11. 

---|--- 
 



   (b) |

To the extent that any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability cannot be
transferred to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.07,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
mutually agreeable arrangements (such as subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting) to provide to the Parties the economic and, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, operational equivalent of the transfer of such
Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability to Buyer as of the Closing and the
performance by Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto, and to otherwise
put Seller and Buyer (and their respective Affiliates) in the position they
would have been in had such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability been
transferred at the Closing. Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor for Seller
pay, perform and discharge fully the liabilities and obligations of Seller
thereunder from and after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted under Law,
Seller shall hold such Purchased Asset in trust for Buyer and pay to Buyer
promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received
by Seller to the extent related to such Purchased Asset in connection with the
arrangements under this Section 2.07. Seller shall be permitted to set off
against such amounts all direct costs associated with the retention and
maintenance of such Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 2.07 shall not apply to any consent
or approval required under any Antitrust Laws, which consent or
approval shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.05.

Page 17 2.08 Withholding Tax. Any payment by Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer making a
payment) of any amount specified in this Agreement will be paid free and
clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of or in
relation to, any Tax unless and to the extent such deduction or withholding is
required by applicable Law, in which case, Buyer (or such Affiliate) will
deduct and withhold the amount required to be deducted or withheld under
applicable Law from the payment (and shall account to the relevant
Governmental Authority for such amount); _provided that_ , if the withholding
arises because the payment is made by an Affiliate of Buyer other than a
Territory Assignee, to the extent Seller (or Sellers relevant Affiliate) is
not able to fully credit such Tax for U.S. federal (or other
applicable jurisdiction) income tax purposes (determined on a with-and-
without basis), such Affiliate shall pay to Seller (or Sellers relevant
Affiliate) such additional amount as shall ensure that, after taking account
of such deduction or withholding and any reduction in U.S. federal (or other
applicable jurisdiction) income tax actually realized by Seller (or Sellers
relevant Affiliate) by crediting or deducting such deduction or withholding
for U.S. federal (or other applicable jurisdiction) income tax purposes
(determined on a with-and-without basis), Seller (or Sellers relevant
Affiliate) receives the amount it would have received absent the requirement
to deduct or withhold. To the extent Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer) makes a
withholding from a payment of any amount specified in this Agreement, Buyer
shall provide Seller with a valid receipt for any such Tax withheld or
deducted and any other documents as required by Seller to claim a credit or
deduction of such withheld Tax. If the withholding Tax is excluded or the rate
thereof is reduced according to the terms of an applicable double Tax treaty
or under other applicable Law, no deduction shall be made or a reduced amount
shall be deducted if Buyer is timely furnished with necessary documents by
Seller, legally required for the application of an exemption or a reduced Tax
rate. The Parties agree to take commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
to eliminate or reduce any such deduction or withholding.

Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the  _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ) setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the
Inventory Book Value (the _Estimated Inventory Book Value_ ) and, based
thereon, its good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (such estimated
amount, the _Estimated Purchase Price_ ). Seller shall prepare the Estimated
Closing Statement in accordance with this Agreement, GAAP and the principles
used to prepare the Financial Statements (in each case, to the
extent consistent with GAAP).

2.10 Final Purchase Price.



   (a) |

Buyer shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event no later than 45 days
after the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the
_Initial Closing Statement_ ) setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of
the Inventory Book Value and, based thereon, its good faith calculation of the
Purchase Price. Buyer shall prepare the Initial Closing Statement in
accordance with this Agreement, GAAP and the principles used to prepare the
Financial Statements (in each case, to the extent consistent with GAAP). 

---|--- 
 



Page 18 Seller will be entitled to review the Initial Closing Statement during
the 45-day period beginning on the date Buyer delivers the Initial Closing
Statement. During such 45-day period, Seller and Sellers Representatives will
be afforded reasonable access to work papers prepared by Buyer or Buyers
Representatives to the extent they relate to the Initial Closing Statement or
to such historical financial information relating to the Initial Closing
Statement as Seller may request, and will be entitled to meet with
Representatives of Buyer on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain and
discuss such information, subject to Sellers execution of customary
confidentiality letters and release letters reasonably satisfactory to Buyer
and its Representatives. Buyer shall use its, and shall cause its Affiliates
to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
Representatives to cooperate with and respond to all reasonable
inquiries made by Seller. At or prior to the end of such thirty 45-day
period, Seller shall either: 

---|--- 



     | (i) |

deliver a notice to Buyer confirming that no adjustments are proposed by
Seller to Buyers calculation of the Inventory Book Value and, based thereon,
the Purchase Price, as set forth on the Initial Closing Statement (a _Notice
of Acceptance_ ), after which, the Initial Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth in the Initial Closing
Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties as the _Final Inventory
Book Value_ , the _Final Closing Statement_ and _Final Purchase Price_ ,
respectively; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

deliver a written notice to Buyer to the effect that Seller believes that
Buyers calculation of Inventory Book Value and, based thereon, the Purchase
Price, as set forth on the Initial Closing Statement contains mathematical
errors or is otherwise not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (a
_Notice of Disagreement_ ), and specifying in reasonable detail and
accompanied by supporting calculations and documentation, the nature of such
mathematical errors or non-compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the
resulting adjustments including each specific amount that, in Sellers view,
should be made to the calculation of Inventory Book Value and, based thereon,
the Purchase Price in order to comply with this Agreement (collectively, the
_Proposed Adjustments_ ); _provided_ _that_ any item in the Initial Closing
Statement that is not disputed in the Notice of Disagreement shall be final
and binding on the Parties for the purposes of determining the Final Inventory
Book Value, the Final Closing Statement and Final Purchase Price hereunder; 

---|---|--- 

_provided that_ that if Seller fails to deliver a Notice of Acceptance or a
Notice of Disagreement within such 45-day period, then the Initial Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth in the
Initial Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties as the
Final Inventory Book Value, the Final Closing Statement and Final Purchase
Price, respectively.

 



Page 19 If there are any Proposed Adjustments, Buyer shall, no later than 30 days
after Buyers receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, notify Seller whether
Buyer accepts or rejects each such Proposed Adjustment; _provided that_ if
Buyer fails to notify Seller of its acceptance or rejection of any Proposed
Adjustment within such 30-day period, then such Proposed Adjustments shall be
deemed accepted by Buyer and the Initial Closing Statement and the calculation
of the Purchase Price as set forth in the Initial Closing Statement shall
be adjusted for such Proposed Adjustment, together with any Unresolved
Adjustments as determined in accordance with this Section 2.10(c), in
determining the Final Inventory Book Value, the Final Closing Statement and
Final Purchase Price, respectively. Thereafter, Seller and Buyer shall work
in good faith to resolve any differences that remain with respect to the
Proposed Adjustments. If any of the Proposed Adjustments are not so resolved
(the _Unresolved Adjustments_ , and the aggregate difference between the
Parties respective calculations of the Purchase Price resulting from the
Unresolved Adjustments, the _Unresolved Balance_ ) within 30 days after
Buyers notice to Seller of its rejection of any Proposed Adjustments (or
such longer period as the Parties may mutually agree in writing), then, at the
request of either Seller or Buyer, the Unresolved Adjustments will be jointly
submitted for arbitration to a mutually agreed nationally recognized firm
with accounting expertise and relevant experience in resolving similar
purchase price adjustment disputes (the _Accounting Firm_ ), and the Parties
will enter into an engagement letter if requested by the Accounting Firm. The
Parties shall mutually determine the procedures with respect to the resolution
of the Unresolved Adjustments; _provided_ _that_ if the Parties do not reach
an agreement on such process within 10 Business Days of the engagement of
the Accounting Firm, then the Accounting Firm shall, within the subsequent 10
Business Days, unilaterally determine such procedures and inform the Parties
in writing of such procedures. The scope of the review by the Accounting Firm
will be limited to: (i) a disposition of the Unresolved Adjustments through a
strict application of the terms of this Agreement, GAAP and the principles
used to prepare the Financial Statements (in each case, to the extent
consistent with GAAP); (ii) based on its determination of the matters
described in clause (i) and all items and amounts that were previously
accepted or agreed upon or deemed agreed upon by the Parties in accordance
with this Section 2.10, as applicable, a calculation of the Inventory Book
Value and, based thereon, the Purchase Price; and (iii) an allocation of the
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm determined in accordance with the
formula specified below in this Section 2.10(c). No Party will disclose to
the Accounting Firm, and the Accounting Firm will not consider for any
purpose, any settlement discussions or offers made by any Party with respect
to the Unresolved Adjustments or otherwise unless expressly agreed to by both
Parties in writing. In no event shall either Party or its Representatives
have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Accounting Firm without
the prior written consent of the other Party. The Accounting Firm shall not be
entitled to, and the  

---|--- 
 



Page 20  Parties shall not individually request the Accounting Firm to, (A) make any
determination other than as set forth above, (B) determine any Unresolved
Adjustment to be a value higher than the highest value or lower than the
lowest value proposed by the Parties in Buyers Initial Closing Statement or
Sellers Notice of Disagreement, (C) undertake any independent investigation
of the facts relating to the Unresolved Adjustments or (D) make any
determination of the legal interpretation of this Agreement. The Accounting
Firm will be instructed to render, as promptly as practicable and, if at all
possible, within 30 days after such submission of the Unresolved Adjustments
to the Accounting Firm, its written decision resolving the matters submitted
to it, which written decision will include a worksheet setting forth the
reason for each Unresolved Adjustment determination, the
material calculations used to determine the Accounting Firms ruling
including the calculation of Inventory Book Value and Final Purchase Price,
and the allocation of its fees and expenses. The determination of the Purchase
Price by the Accounting Firm and the statement prepared by the Accounting
Firm setting forth such determination will, absent manifest error, be final
and binding on the Parties as the Final Inventory Book Value, the Final
Purchase Price and the Final Closing Statement, respectively, and judgment
may be entered upon such determination and statement in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant
to this Section 2.10(c) shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, as determined by the Accounting Firm based on the inverse
of the percentage that the Accounting Firms determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total value of each partys respective position in
relation to the total amount of the Unresolved Balance. For purposes of
illustration only, if the Unresolved Balance is $100, and the written
determination of the Accounting Firm states that $80 of the Unresolved Balance
is resolved in Buyers favor and $20 of the Unresolved Balance is resolved in
Sellers favor, Buyer would bear 20% of the Accounting Firms costs and
expenses, on the one hand, and Seller would bear 80% of such costs and
expenses, on the other hand. All other fees, expenses, and costs incurred by
a Party or its Representatives in connection with this Section 2.10 shall be
borne by such Party. 

---|--- 



   (d) |

If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts Seller designates in writing to Buyer, an amount in
cash equal to such difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts Buyer designates in
writing to Seller, an amount in cash equal to such difference. In either case,
such payment shall be made within five Business Days after the date on which
the Final Purchase Price becomes final and binding pursuant to this Section
2.10. If the Final Purchase Price is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price,
then neither Party shall be required to make a further payment pursuant
to this Section 2.10. 

---|--- 
 



Page 21 In addition to the payment made pursuant to Section 2.10(d), concurrently with
making such payment (if the payment is to be made by Buyer) or no later than
the Business Day following such payment (if the payment is to be made by
Seller), Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts Seller designates in writing to Buyer, an
amount equal to the Final Inventory Book Value _multiplied by_ 0.125. 

---|--- 



   (f) |

The Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.10 as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Representations and Warranties of Seller

 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedules (it being understood
that information disclosed in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules to which the relevance of such information to such
other section is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto),
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof, as follows:

 



Page 23 4.01 Organization and Qualification of Seller. Seller is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state of Washington and has all necessary corporate power and authority to
own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased
by it and to carry on the Business as currently conducted in all material
respects. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of the Purchased Assets
or the operation of the Business as currently conducted makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.02 Authority of Seller. Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller (as
applicable) has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Seller or such
Affiliate is a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and any other Transaction
Document to which Seller or an Affiliate of Seller is a party, the performance
by Seller and its Affiliates of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation by Seller and its Affiliates of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of Seller and its Affiliates. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). When each
other Transaction Document to which Seller or its Affiliates is or will be a
party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller or such Affiliate
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding
obligation of Seller or its Affiliate(s) enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

4.03 No Conflicts; Consents.



   (a) |

The execution, delivery and performance by Seller or its Affiliates (as
applicable) of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not: (i) result in a violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of  

---|--- 
 



Page 24  incorporation, by-laws or other applicable organizational documents of
Seller or such Affiliate; (ii) result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Seller or its
Affiliates, the Business or the Purchased Assets; or (iii) require the
consent, notice or other action by any Person under, conflict with, result in
a violation or breach of, constitute a default under or result in the
acceleration of any Material Contract; except in the cases of clauses (ii) and
(iii), where the violation, breach, conflict, default, acceleration or failure
to give notice would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or materially delay the ability of Seller or its Affiliates to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise comply with and perform
their obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents. 

---|--- 



   (b) |

No consent, approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with,
or notice to, any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to
Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for: (i) such
filings as may be required under the HSR Act; (ii) the filings or approvals
under the other Antitrust Laws set forth in Section 4.03(b)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules; (iii) the consents, notices or other actions set forth
in Section 4.03(b)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules; and (iv) such

Records, Assigned Contracts and other documents and data exclusively related
to the Business; and (b) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such
financial, operating and other data and information exclusively related to the
Business as Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably request;
_provided that_ any such access shall be limited to normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice to Seller, under the supervision of Sellers
personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the conduct of the
Business or any other businesses of Seller. All requests by Buyer for access
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be submitted or directed

 



Page 39  exclusively to such individual as Seller shall designate in writing from
time to time. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall, not later than 10
Business Days before the Closing: (i) deliver a list of all current Trade
Programs to Buyer; and (ii) supplement or amend (by written notice to Buyer)
Section 2.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter
arising or discovered after the date of this Agreement that, if existing,
occurring or known at or prior to the date of this Agreement, should have been
set forth or described in such Section 2.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules; _provided that_ the obligation to provide such list of Trade
Programs or to supplement or amend Section 2.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to be a condition to Closing, nor any failure
thereof give rise to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement by Seller (or any related claim for indemnification).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not
be required to disclose any information or afford access to Buyer if such
disclosure or access would, in Sellers sole discretion be reasonably likely:
(x) result in the disclosure of information that is competitively sensitive in
relation to, or constitutes trade secrets of, Seller and its businesses
(including the Business); (y) jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney work-
product or other applicable privilege; or (z) contravene any Law, fiduciary
duty or Contract to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party. Prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller (which may granted
Sellers sole discretion), Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or
customers of, the Business, and Buyer shall have no right to perform invasive
or subsurface investigations of the Leased Real Property. Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or information provided
pursuant to this Section 6.02.

 

6.03 Employees and Employee Benefits.



   (a) |

Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate
of Buyer to, offer employment effective on, and subject to the occurrence of,
the Closing Date, to all Employees whose employment does not otherwise
transfer to Buyer or its Affiliate by operation of Law, for U.S. Employees
such offer shall be made 15 days before the Closing Date (or such longer
period of time before the Closing Date as shall be required in order to comply
with any applicable collective labor contract or applicable Laws) and for
Non-U.S. Employees whose employment does not transfer by operation of Law
such offer shall be made no later than 30 days after the Closing Date (or, if
later, immediately following the date on which the Buyer becomes aware that
the Non-U.S. Employee has not transferred by operation of Law), in each case,
including Employees who are absent due to vacation, family leave, or other
approved leave of absence, on terms and conditions that are consistent with
the requirements of this Section 6.03 and applicable Law; _provided_ _that_
any such Employee absent due to short-term (including parental leave) or long-
term disability or workers compensation leave (collectively, _Employees on
Disability Leave_ ) so presents himself or herself within the earlier of 2
years following the date that he or she incurred such injury or disability or
the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Each Employee whose employment
transfers to Buyer or its Affiliate by operation of Law and each Employee who
accepts such employment shall be a _Transferred Employee_. Each 

---|--- 
 



Page 40  Employee on Disability Leave who accepts such offer and actually returns to
work not later than the earlier of 2 years following the incurrence of such
injury or disability or the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall
become a Transferred Employee effective as of the date of such return. The
date of such return shall be considered the _Transfer Date_ of each such
Employee on Disability Leave, and the Closing Date shall be considered the
_Transfer Date_ for each other Transferred Employee. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall assume, or shall cause an Affiliate
of Buyer to assume, in accordance with applicable Law, the employment of each
Non-U.S. Employee whose employment transfers to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
Transfer Regulations or any similar applicable non-U.S. Law, as of or
immediately following the Closing, as if originally made between the Buyer or
its relevant Affiliate and the relevant Non-U.S. Employee. If the Buyer or
the relevant Buyer Affiliate fails to make an offer of employment to any
Employee on the terms set out in this Section 6.03, or the Buyer or Buyer
Affiliate makes any substantial change in working conditions to the material
detriment of any Non-U.S. Employee subject to the Transfer Regulations or any
similar applicable non-U.S. Law, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller for any
and all losses, damages, costs (including legal costs reasonably incurred)
and expenses (including Taxes), in each case of any nature whatsoever suffered
or incurred by the Seller arising out of the termination of employment of any
such Employee or Non-U.S. Employee, as applicable. If any person not
designated as an Employee asserts or establishes that his or her employment
has transferred to the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate pursuant to the Transfer
Regulations (an _Undisclosed Employee_ ) upon Closing, the Buyer or a Buyer
Affiliate shall, within 14 Business Days of being so informed either by the
Undisclosed Employee or by the Seller (whichever is the earlier) inform the
Seller whether or not the Buyer wishes to employ the Undisclosed Employee. If
the Buyer does not wish to employ the Undisclosed Employee, the Seller shall
within 14 Business Days of being so informed be entitled at its absolute
discretion to offer employment to the Undisclosed Employee. If such offer is
not made within that 14 Business Day period or such offer is made and not
accepted by the Undisclosed Employee, the Buyer or the relevant Buyer
Affiliate shall be entitled to terminate the Undisclosed Employees
employment and if it does so within 30 Business days thereafter shall be
indemnified by the Seller for any and all losses, damages, costs (including
legal costs reasonably incurred) and expenses (including Taxes), in each case
of any nature whatsoever suffered or incurred by the Buyer or any Buyer
Affiliate arising from the employment or alleged employment of such
Undisclosed Employee pursuant to the Transfer Regulations from the date of the
transfer or alleged transfer of their employment, including, without
limitation, arising out of the termination of employment of such Undisclosed
Employee. With respect to any Non-U.S. Employee subject to the Transfer
Regulations or any similar applicable non-U.S. Law, and except where
permitted pursuant to such Transfer Regulations or applicable non-U.S. Law,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not propose any changes to such Non-U.S.
Employees working conditions or terms and conditions of employment or
otherwise take any action (including 

---|--- 
 



Page 41  any communication with any Non-U.S. Employee or Employee Representative)
that might cause such Non-U.S. Employee to resign prior to the Closing. With
respect to Non-U.S. Employees, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of
Buyer to, (x) provide Seller with such information and assistance at such
times as that Party may reasonably request which may be reasonably necessary
for it or any of its Affiliates to comply with any legal requirement (whether
statutory or pursuant to any written agreement with, or the constitution of,
any works council or other employee body) to provide information to or
consult with Employees, a relevant trade union or works council or any other
employee representatives, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (y) at the reasonable request of Seller, cooperate in
preparation for any information, negotiation and/or consultation process which
Seller undertakes with Employees or their representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that
the outcome of the consultation procedure with the competent works council in
the Netherlands, and any other relevant consultation procedure where such an
outcome is required by local Law, should still be able to have a meaningful
impact on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, any Liability arising out of any act or omission by the Seller or
any Seller Affiliate on or before the Transfer Date in relation to the
employment of any Non-U.S. Employee (or relating to the employment or
termination of employment of any Undisclosed Employee), where such liability
transfers or is alleged to transfer to the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate pursuant
to the Transfer Regulations shall not be treated as assumed by the Buyer or a
Buyer Affiliate hereunder and shall constitute an Excluded Liability
hereunder. 

---|--- 



   (b) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
the individuals employed in the Business by Seller and its Affiliates
(whether or not actively at work on the Closing Date) listed on Section
6.03(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller shall have the right to
reassign: (i) two individuals on such list in the EMEA Foodservice division;
and (ii) subject to the written approval of Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), such other individuals on such
list as are, in each case, selected in the good faith discretion of Seller so
that such individuals do not become Transferred Employees upon the Closing and
with respect to periods on and after Closing shall not constitute Employees
hereunder; _provided that_ Seller notifies Buyer of such reassignment no
less than 30 days prior to the Closing; and _provided further that_ , Buyer
will not be in breach of any obligation to make an offer of employment to any
such individuals as otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.03. For avoidance
of doubt, Buyer shall be permitted to make offers of employment prior to
Closing to the Employees located in the UK. In addition, Buyer and Seller
shall consult in good faith, commencing no later than twenty (20) days after
the date of this Agreement regarding the possible addition to the list of
Employees of individuals employed by Seller or its Affiliates in research and
development projects related to the Business. 

---|--- 
 



Page 42 Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by local Law, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, for at least 12 months following
the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, provide
each Transferred Employee as of his or her respective Transfer Date with: (i)
base salary or hourly wages which are at least equal to the base salary or
hourly wages provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) target
cash bonus opportunities, if any, which are at least equal to the target cash
bonus opportunities provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing; and
(iii) other employee benefits (except as provided in Section 6.03(d)) that are
substantially similar to those provided by Buyer to newly hired similarly
situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates
shall pay to any Transferred Employee the portion of any accrued annual bonus
compensation for the calendar year of Closing in respect of each Transferred
Employee which is attributable (on a pro-rata basis) to the period ending on
the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the applicable Seller annual
bonus plan to which the relevant annual bonus accrual relates; _provided_
_that_  Seller and its Affiliates shall treat any individual performance
requirement as having been satisfied. 

---|--- 



   (d) |

Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by local Law, in the
event of termination of the employment of any Transferred Employee by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (other than for cause), on or during the 12 month
period following, the Closing, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause Buyers
Affiliates to provide, the Transferred Employee with severance pay and
benefits no less favorable than the greater of the severance pay and benefits
to which the Transferred Employee (i) would have been entitled under any
applicable severance plan, policy, practice, or arrangement of Seller
immediately prior to the Closing as described in Section 6.03(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, or (ii) is entitled under any severance plan, policy,
practice or arrangement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which
such Transferred Employee participates or is applicable to such Transferred
Employee on the actual date of termination of the Transferred Employees
employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any term in Seller, Buyer or
their Affiliates severance plans, policies or arrangements, Buyer or its
Affiliates may make any severance payment to a Transferred Employee contingent
upon such Transferred Employee executing and delivering a market customary
release of general claims in a form satisfactory to Buyer or its Affiliates. 

---|--- 



   (e) |

Section 6.03(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of the
outstanding long-term equity incentive awards held by Employees under the
Seller equity incentive plans as of the most recent practicable date prior to
the date hereof. To the extent that any such Employee forfeits any portion of
such long-term equity incentive awards in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as a result of becoming a Transferred Employee
hereunder and ceasing to be employed within the affiliated group of Seller: 

---|--- 
 



Page 43 Seller shall provide any such Employee with a one-time cash award in an
amount equal to the approximate intrinsic value as of the date of this
Agreement of the unvested portion of any equity grants scheduled to vest in
2018 or 2019, other than performance RSU grants made on November 21, 2016
under the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan to certain Employees. Such
cash award shall be payable on or as soon as practicable after 180 days after
the Closing Date; _provided that_ such Employee remains employed by Seller and
its Affiliates through Closing and by Buyer and its Affiliates through 180
days after the Closing Date; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Buyer shall establish a long-term (cash-based) incentive plan (the _Buyer
Incentive Plan_ ) which shall provide cash retention awards in an amount
equal to the approximate intrinsic value as of the date of this Agreement of
the unvested portion of any equity grants scheduled to vest in 2020, 2021 and
2022. The vesting schedule of such retention awards under the Buyer Incentive
Plan shall be consistent with the vesting schedule of the unvested equity
awards to which they relate (so that such Employee must remain employed with
Buyer or its Affiliates through such scheduled vesting date in order to be
entitled to payment with respect to such award), and such cash retention
awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms of the Buyer Incentive Plan.
The Buyer Incentive Plan shall be separate from any Benefit Plan and Buyer is
not assuming any equity awards of Seller and its Affiliates, any related
Benefit Plan or any liabilities thereunder. 

---|---|--- 
 

For purposes of this section, the "intrinsic value as of the date of this
Agreement" shall mean (x) in the case of a restricted stock unit, the closing
market value on such date of the number of shares of Seller underlying such
restricted stock unit, and (y) in the case of a stock option, to the excess,
if any, of the closing market value on such date of the number of shares of
Seller underlying such stock option over the option price for such stock
option. To the extent that, under the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer,
any Buyer Affiliate or their payroll systems are to process or assist
in processing, on Sellers behalf or otherwise, any of the retention payments
described in Section 6.03(e)(i), Seller shall, no later than 30 Business Days
after Closing provide Buyer with a complete and accurate schedule of each
such payment, specifying the amount payable to each such Employee, and no
such accommodation shall result in a recharacterization of the ultimate
responsibility for such payment as between Buyer and Seller.

 



   (f) |

Subject to the otherwise applicable provisions of this Section 6.03 and in
addition to the requirements imposed by local Law, and to the extent
administratively practicable, from and after a Transferred Employees Transfer
Date, such Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in the plans
or programs maintained, sponsored, adopted or contributed to by Buyer or its
Affiliates (collectively, _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ) that provide medical,
dental, vision care, life insurance, disability, vacation, tuition
reimbursement, qualified transportation fringe benefits and other welfare
benefits, on substantially the same basis as similarly situated employees of
Buyer, subject to the applicable terms and conditions of such plans and
policies in effect from time to time. With respect to any Buyer Benefit Plans
for the benefit of any Transferred Employee, subject, and 

---|--- 
 



Page 44  in addition, to the requirements imposed by local Law, effective as of the
Closing, and to the extent administratively practicable and in accordance with
the terms of the governing policy, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliate
to, recognize all service of the Transferred Employees with Seller, as if such
service were with Buyer, for all purposes, including for purposes of vesting,
eligibility, accruals for vacation and severance programs, and determination
of the level of benefits; _provided that_ such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by local Law, and to
the extent administratively practicable and in accordance with the terms of
the governing policy, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to: (i) waive
any limitation on health and welfare coverage of such Transferred Employees
due to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, active employment
requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under any
applicable health and welfare plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to the
extent such Transferred Employees were covered under a similar benefit plan of
Seller or any of its Affiliates and (ii) credit each such Transferred Employee
with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such
employee under any medical plan of Seller or any of its Affiliates prior his
or her Transfer Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied any
applicable deductible and whether such employee has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any benefit plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for such
year. 

---|--- 
 



   (g) |

Effective as of a Transferred Employees Transfer Date, such Transferred
Employee shall cease active participation in the Benefit Plans. Seller shall
remain liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the Benefit Plans
that are incurred by the Employees prior to his or her Transfer Date. For
purposes of this Agreement, the following claims shall be deemed to be
incurred as follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term
disability, and workers compensation insurance benefits, on the event giving
rise to such benefits; (ii) medical, vision, dental, and prescription drug
benefits, on the date the applicable services, materials or supplies were
provided; and (iii) long-term disability benefits, on the event giving rise to
such benefits. 

---|--- 
 



   (h) |

Buyer shall maintain, or cause one of its Affiliates to maintain, as of the
Closing, a Buyer Benefit Plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (a _Qualified Benefit Plan_ ) in which the Transferred Employees shall be
eligible to participate where they participated in a similar Seller plan prior
to the Transfer Date. Buyer shall permit each such Transferred Employee to
effect a direct rollover (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
all of any such Transferred Employees balance under any Benefit Plan that is
a Qualified Benefit Plan (including after-Tax employee contributions and any
outstanding loans), to Buyers Qualified Benefit Plan, subject to the terms
and conditions of each such plan and provided that any direct rollover
involving outstanding loans shall only be permitted pursuant to such
procedures as Buyer may direct. Seller shall, or cause its Affiliate to, fully
vest each Transferred Employee in his or her account under any defined
contribution or other retirement plan maintained by Seller (or its Affiliate)
as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.03(h) does
not apply to any Non-US Employees (including any Transferred Employee located
in the UK).  

---|--- 
 



Page 45 Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by local Law, Buyer
agrees (i) to cause Buyers or its Affiliates flexible spending
reimbursement account plan ( _Buyer_ __ _s Flex Plan_ ) to accept a spin-off
of the balance of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts from Sellers
flexible spending reimbursement account plan ( _Seller_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_
), (ii) to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Transferred Employee under
Sellers Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
on and after the Closing Date, to assume or cause its Affiliate to assumed,
and be solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by Transferred
Employees under the flexible spending reimbursement accounts of Sellers
Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred from Sellers
Cafeteria Plan to Buyers Flex Plan the excess of the aggregate accumulated
contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made prior to
the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by
Transferred Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made prior to
the Closing Date for such year from such accounts prior to the Closing Date to
the Transferred Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts made prior to the Closing Date during
the year in which the Closing Date occurs made to Transferred Employees
exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts prior to the
Closing Date for such year by the Transferred Employees, Buyer shall cause
such excess to be transferred to Seller as soon as practicable following the
date or dates that Buyer or its Affiliate collects such excess amounts from
the applicable participants through Buyers or its Affiliates payroll
processing procedures. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliate to, assume and be solely responsible for all claims for
reimbursement by Transferred Employees under the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts of Sellers Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred prior to,
on or after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the
Closing Date. 

---|--- 



   (j) |

This Section 6.03 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 6.03, express or implied,
shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.03. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.03 shall not create any right
in any Transferred Employee or any other Person to any continued employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever. 

---|--- 
 



Page 46 6.04 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall automatically terminate immediately upon the consummation of the
Closing without any further actions by the Parties.

6.05 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

 



   (a) |

Each of Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly
obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities that may be, or become, necessary for its performance of its
obligations pursuant to, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement (including the Required Regulatory Approvals), (ii) take all
such actions as may be requested by any such Governmental Authority to obtain
such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals and (iii) avoid the entry
of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Buyer and Seller will cooperate in seeking promptly
(and, in any event, no later than the Outside Date) to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; ___provided that_ , the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to obtaining approvals under
U.S. Antitrust Law, the term "reasonable best efforts" as used in this Section
6.05 shall not require either Party to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect
or agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets,
properties or businesses of such Party or any of its Affiliates for the
purposes of obtaining any Required Regulatory Approval if such assets,
properties or businesses are carried on under a trademark that is also used
for the distribution, sale and marketing of products outside of the United
States. Other than in respect of U.S. Antitrust Laws, in the event that a
Governmental Authority requires, as a condition to the receipt of an
applicable Required Regulatory Approval, any covenants, undertakings or other
agreements or arrangements of, or by, a Party or any of its Affiliates, the
Parties hereby expressly agree (unless they have otherwise agreed in writing)
to, without reduction to the consideration to be paid to Seller under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents: (A) amend this Agreement in
order to effect the removal from the definition of Purchased Assets (and, to
the extent applicable, Assumed Liabilities) all assets, properties or
businesses that are within the jurisdiction of such Governmental Authority
(and the abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other
Transaction Documents with respect thereto); (B) amend the other Transaction
Documents to give effect to such removal (including by reducing the scope of
the supply and license arrangements contemplated by the Transaction Documents
in order to align such arrangements with the amendment contemplated by clause
(A) above); and (C) 

---|--- 
 



Page 47  withdraw any and all filings from any such Governmental Authority previously
made in accordance with Section 6.05(b), with the cumulative effect of clauses
(A) though (C) of this Section 6.05(a) that such Governmental Authority no
longer has jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. The foregoing agreement in this Section 6.05(a) is made solely to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including, to the extent
amended as contemplated above) and is not intended to constitute an admission
that such transactions, if consummated without any such amendment, would
violate any Law (including any Antitrust Law). 

---|--- 



   (b) |

In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Section
6.05, Seller and Buyer each agrees to make or cause to be made an appropriate
filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within 10 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act. Furthermore, each of Buyer and Seller agrees to, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, or as otherwise required by Law,
make any other filing that may be required with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any other Antitrust Law or by any other
Governmental Authority, including in connection with all Required Regulatory
Approvals, and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to such filings. In
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall
have responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining
clearance under the HSR Act; _provided that_ Buyer shall consider and take
into account the views of Seller when devising and implementing the strategy
with respect to obtaining clearance under the HSR Act and (ii) Buyer and
Seller shall jointly have responsibility for devising and implementing the
strategy for obtaining all other Required Regulatory Approvals. 

---|--- 



   (c) |

All filing fees required in connection with any filings with any Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Law, national security or other Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority shall be borne by Buyer, and each Party
shall be responsible for any other payment of its own respective costs and
expenses incurred by such Party (including attorneys fees and other legal
fees and expenses) associated with the preparation of its portion of any such
filings. 

---|--- 



   (d) |

Each of Buyer and Seller shall keep the other Party apprised and on a
reasonably timely basis of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the matters contemplated in this Section 6.05,
comply with any such inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, promptly
notify the other Party of any oral or written communication it receives from
any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement, permit the other  

---|--- 
 



Page 48  Party a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and provide any comments
on any communication proposed to be made by such Party to any Governmental
Authority and provide the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings or other communications between them or any of their Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on
the other hand (and each Party shall give due consideration to any comments
received from the other Party thereof); _provided that_ materials may be
redacted: (x) to remove information that is competitively sensitive; (y) so as
not jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney work-product or other applicable
privilege; or (z) so as not to contravene any Law. To the extent reasonably
practicable, neither Party shall agree to participate in any meeting, or
engage in any conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other Party in advance and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting or conversation. Neither Party shall, without the prior written
consent of the other Party, extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or enter into any Contract with a
Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. Subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and to Section 6.02, the Parties will coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law.  

---|--- 



   (e) |

Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates
to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or take any other action if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to the consummation of such acquisition, merger,
consolidation or other action could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
significant delay in the obtaining of or significantly increase the risk of
not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals
of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv)
significantly delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

Page 49 6.06 Books and Records.

 



   (a) |

For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer shall: 

---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

retain the Books and Records (including personnel files) relating to periods
prior to the Closing; and  

---|---|---

6.09 Guarantees and Commitments.



   (a) |

The Parties shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause Buyer or one of its controlled Affiliates to be substituted for
Seller and any of Sellers Affiliates, and for Seller and any of Sellers
Affiliates to be released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of all
obligations of Seller and any of Sellers Affiliates under each of the
guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letters of comfort, commitments,
understandings, agreements and other obligations of such Persons related to
any Purchased Asset (collectively, the _Substituted Guarantees_ ). 

---|--- 
 



Page 51 In the event that, as of the Closing, Buyer or one of its controlled
Affiliates shall not have substituted itself for Seller and any of Sellers
Affiliates under, nor caused Seller and Sellers Affiliates to be released
from, any Substituted Guarantee: (i) the Parties shall continue to cooperate
and use such respective reasonable best efforts to cause Buyer or one of its
controlled Affiliates to be substituted for Seller and any of Sellers
Affiliates, and for Seller and any of Sellers Affiliates to be released, in
respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its respective Affiliates
under any Substituted Guarantee; and (ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and Sellers Affiliates against any Losses that Seller or any
of Sellers Affiliates suffers, incurs or is liable for by reason of or
arising out of or in consequence of such Substituted Guarantee. 

---|--- 

6.10 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions
of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may
otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the
Purchased Assets to Buyer.

 

6.11 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
all transfer, documentary, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including any real property
transfer Tax and any other similar Tax, but excluding any Indirect
Tax) (collectively, _Transfer Taxes_ ) shall be borne and paid by Buyer when
due. Buyer shall, at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Seller shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith
and take commercially reasonable steps to duly and properly prepare, execute
and file any certificates or other documents that may reduce or eliminate any
such Transfer Taxes. If either Party determines that any Transfer Taxes are
required to be paid in connection with this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, it will promptly inform the other Party of such
determination.

 

6.12 Indirect Taxes. All amounts payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
under or pursuant to this Agreement are exclusive of Indirect Taxes. If
Seller (or any of its Affiliates) is obligated by applicable Law to collect,
charge, remit or otherwise account to a Governmental Authority for any
Indirect Tax with respect to any sale or supply for which any amount payable
under or pursuant to this Agreement is consideration, Buyer shall in addition
to any other consideration for that sale or supply, and within ten Business
Days from receipt of a valid invoice, pay to Seller an amount equal to such
Indirect Tax. This Agreement will not be construed as being an invoice for
Indirect Taxes or similar purposes. If Buyer qualifies for an exemption from
any such applicable Indirect Taxes, Buyer will deliver to Seller such
certificates, elections, or other documentation required under applicable Law
or the administration thereof to substantiate and effect the exemption claimed
by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in duly and properly
preparing, executing and filing any certificates or other documents that may
reduce or eliminate any such Indirect Taxes. Buyer shall ensure that all
Indirect Taxes which are not the responsibility of Seller or its Affiliates to
collect, charge, remit or otherwise account for to a Governmental Authority
under applicable Law are paid to the relevant Governmental Authority within
any applicable time limits and shall indemnify Seller (and Sellers
Affiliates) in respect of any Losses occasioned by Blacks failure to do so.
This Section 6.12 applies only to the transfer of the Business, the
Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and payments under this
Agreement (including, if applicable, the Buyer Termination Fee), and not to
payments under any other Transaction Document other than this Agreement, the
terms of which, in each case, will govern as to any Indirect Taxes.

 



Page 52 6.13 Straddle Periods. Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to
allocate any Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period between the Pre-Closing
Period and the remainder of the Straddle Period, (a) the amount of Property
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period, and (b) the amount of Taxes (other than
Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed based on
an interim closing of the books as if such taxable period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

 

6.14 Litigation. Prior to the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the
other Party in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document (including any litigation of the kind contemplated by Section 6.05)
that is brought or threatened in writing against such Party or its Affiliates
and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed on a current basis with
respect to the status thereof.

6.15 Foreign Implementing Agreements. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall cause the Foreign Implementing
Agreements to be prepared by their respective applicable Affiliates in each
jurisdiction in which Seller and Buyer agree that a Foreign Implementing
Agreement is necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the Foreign
Implementing Agreements shall not expand or limit the rights and obligations
of Seller and Buyer beyond those provided for in this Agreement, and that the
Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not provide for any additional rights or
obligations of Seller, Buyer or their respective applicable Affiliates that
are not provided for in this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in
the preparation of the Foreign Implementing Agreements and shall include such
terms as necessary to comply with applicable Law of each applicable
foreign jurisdiction. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the
Foreign Implementing Agreements and this Agreement, Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement shall control and that,
if necessary, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, deliver such additional instruments as may be necessary to
accomplish the foregoing.

 

6.16 Transition Services Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and enter into a
transition services agreement to be effective as of the Closing for the
provision of the transition services by Seller (or its applicable Affiliate)
to Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) that are set forth on Annex B to
this Agreement (and for the duration reflected therein), as such schedule may
be modified or supplemented by Buyer (acting reasonably) with Sellers
approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, prior to the Closing
(to remove any transition service included therein as of the date hereof or
to add such other services that were

 



Page 53  provided by Seller or its Affiliates to the Business prior to the Closing
that Buyer desires to be provided by Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) to
Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) on a transitional basis after the
Closing); _provided that_ Seller may withhold such approval with respect to
the addition of any services where such addition would be unduly burdensome to
Seller or its Affiliates (taking into account cost, complexity, technological
requirements and other factors) (the _Transition Services Agreement_ ), which
Transition Services Agreement shall provide that such services shall be
provided in substantially the same manner and at a cost equal to the costs
incurred by Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) to provide such services
(such costs to be based on Sellers (or its applicable Affiliates) actual
costs (which in the case of costs that are not readily identifiable shall
be based on Sellers reasonable, good faith estimates) to provide such
services, including for employees (including retention charges, if any),
third-party service providers and real estate), and shall contain such other
terms, conditions and limitations of damages as is customary for an agreement
of such type in a transaction of this size and nature. A cost estimate for
such services is set forth on Annex C to this Agreement, which estimate the
Parties acknowledge and agree is solely for illustrative purposes and is not
binding.

   (c) |

by Buyer, by written notice to Seller if Buyer is not then in material breach
of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a material breach,

or Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or (y) __ by Buyer pursuant to any
other Section and at such time, Seller had the right to terminate this

(y), as of the time of such termination, one or more of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 7.01(a)(i) or 7.01(b) (solely to the extent such
Governmental Order relates to a U.S. Antitrust Law and was imposed by a
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the enforcement of U.S.
Antitrust Laws) shall not have been satisfied, or (b) by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) or Section 8.01(b)(iii) (in each case, solely

Page 57  of such termination, (i) all of the other conditions set forth in Section
7.01 and Section 7.02 have been satisfied or waived (except for those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing;
_provided_ _that_ such conditions were then capable of being satisfied if the
Closing had taken place) and (ii) Seller is not in breach in any material
respect of its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
resulted in the failure of the conditions to Closing referred to in clause (a)
above or the imposition of the Law or Governmental Order referred to in clause
(b) above, then Buyer shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer that is United States
person within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code for the purposes of
Section 250 of the Code (a _U.S. Person_ ) to pay to Seller the Buyer
Termination Fee in immediately available funds within two Business Days of
such termination. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Buyer
Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather shall constitute
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount compensating Seller in
the circumstances in which such Buyer Termination Fee is due and payable, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement, and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Buyer
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without
these agreements, Seller would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Buyer fails to cause the payment in a timely manner of any amount due pursuant
to Section 8.03, then (A) Buyer shall cause an Affiliate that is a U.S.
Person to reimburse Seller for all costs and expenses (including disbursements
and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by Seller in the collection of such
overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions or
Proceedings commenced by Seller, and (B) Buyer shall cause an Affiliate that
is a U.S. Person to pay to Seller interest on such amount from and including
the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2% per annum.
Sellers right to receive payment from Buyer of the Buyer Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 8.03, under circumstances in which such fee is
payable in accordance with this Agreement, shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer and any of its former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the _Purchaser Related Parties_ ), and, upon payment of such amount, none of
the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise).

to Section 9.04 is given to the Indemnifying Party within the applicable
survival period specified in the immediately preceding sentence, in which case
the survival period with respect to such representation or warranty shall
be extended until such claim is finally and fully resolved; _provided that_ ,
if such notice is given, any Proceeding brought with respect thereto shall be
initiated no later than six months following the expiration of such survival
period, after which time period the right to bring or maintain such claim
shall terminate. All covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in this

Indemnified Party shall promptly after becoming aware of such Third Party
Claim or Direct Claim deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such Third Party Claim or Direct
Claim and the amount or estimated amount thereof, which amount or estimated
amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount, if any, of such Third
Party Claim or Direct Claim together with reasonably supporting documentation
for such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim (each, a _Claim Notice_ ); 
_provided that_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to promptly deliver
a Claim Notice shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying
Partys obligations with respect thereto except to the extent (and only to
the extent) that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced as a result of such
failure. 

---|--- 



   (b) |

In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
within 30 days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Claim Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim to assume the control and defense of such
claim and appoint counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party in
connection with such Third Party Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate
counsel retained by any Indemnified Party;  _provided_ _that_ (i) such
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if, in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable. Absent such a conflict, if and to the
extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys
expense, in contesting any Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall at all times have the right to
participate fully in the defense of any Third Party Claim at its own expense
directly or through counsel; _provided that_   

---|--- 
 



Page 60  the control of such defense shall remain with the Indemnifying Party if it
is entitled to control such defense in accordance with this Section 9.04. The
Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless (x) the
Indemnified Party receives an unqualified release from all liability from the
claimant in connection with such Third Party Claim and (y) such settlement or
compromise (i) does not restrict the business of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission
of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates and (iii) only involves liabilities that will
be fully paid and discharged by the Indemnifying Party. 

---|--- 
 

9.05 Insurance. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Losses shall
be net of any third-party insurance or other third-party recoveries actually
received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall
use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all third-party insurance and third-party indemnity
provisions covering such Losses to the same extent as it would if such Losses
were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 

9.06 Calculation of Losses.



   (a) |

In determining the amount of any Losses for purposes of Section 9.02(a),
9.02(b), 9.03(a) or 9.03(b), no effect shall be given to any qualification in
any relevant representation or warranty consisting of the terms "material,"
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect"; _provided that_ the full effect
shall be given to all such qualifications for purposes of determining the
existence of a breach of any representation or warranty. 

---|--- 



   (b) |

For purposes of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.04(a) and Section 4.04(b), in determining the amount of any Losses for
purposes of Sections 9.02(b), such Losses shall be calculated on a net basis,
taking into account breaches of such representations and warranties that give
rise to Losses as well as breaches of such representations and warranties
that accrue to the benefit of Buyer. 

---|--- 

9.07 Exceptions and Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary:



   (a) |

no Indemnifying Party shall, on account of any indemnification obligations set
forth herein, be liable for any punitive damages (except to the extent
actually awarded with respect to a Third Party Claim indemnifiable pursuant to
this Article IX); 

---|--- 



   (b) |

no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to save, defend, indemnify or hold
harmless any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.02(b) (other than Losses
arising pursuant to any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Section 4.04(b), to which this Section
9.07(b) shall not apply) or  

---|--- 
 



Page 61  Section 9.03(b), as applicable, unless and until: (i) the amount of Losses
in respect of such claim, or series of related claims, exceeds $250,000; and
(ii) the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Indemnifying Party
would be liable under this Article IX in respect of all such claims, or series
of related claims, exceeds $50,000,000 and then the Indemnifying Party shall
be required to indemnify the Indemnified Party only for the amounts in excess
of such threshold; and 

---|--- 



   (c) |

an Indemnifying Partys maximum aggregate liability pursuant to this Article
IX shall not exceed: (i) $7,150,000,000 with respect to (A) any breach or
inaccuracy of any Seller Fundamental Representation, (B) any breach or
inaccuracy of any Buyer Fundamental Representation, (C) any indemnifiable
breach of or failure by Seller or its applicable Affiliates to timely perform
any agreement or covenant of Seller or its applicable Affiliates set forth in
this Agreement and (D) any indemnifiable breach of or failure by Buyer or its
applicable Affiliates to timely perform any agreement or covenant of Buyer or
its applicable Affiliates set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) $715,000,000
with respect to (A) any breach or inaccuracy of a Buyer Additional Surviving
Representation or (B) any breach or inaccuracy of a Seller Additional
Surviving Representation. 

---|--- 

9.08 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the extent permitted by Law,
Buyer and Seller agree to treat any payment made under this Article IX as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

 

9.09 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. The sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties
for Losses based upon or resulting from breaches of representations and
warranties shall be strictly limited to those contained in this Article IX;
_provided_ _that_ (a) the foregoing limitation shall not apply to remedies
that may be available with respect to claims for actual fraud (which the
Parties agree shall occur where a Party has a cause of action for fraud that
requires as an element an intent to deceive or scienter of the fraudulent
nature of the representation and warranty, but not any type of fraud cause of
action based solely on negligence, recklessness or similar negligence- or
recklessness-type constructive fraud as the intent or scienter standard) nor
shall the survival periods set forth in Section 9.01, or the termination or
expiration of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement in
accordance with Section 9.01, apply to, limit or preclude such claims and (b)
this Section 9.09 shall not (i) operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of Section 2.10 or (ii) limit the rights of the
Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief).

 

Article X

10.01 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs and
expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid

shall have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, in the event of any proceeding relating to this Agreement, if a

 

court of competent jurisdiction determines (in a judgment not subject to
further appeal or for which the time for appeal has expired), that a Party
has breached this Agreement, then such breaching Party shall be liable for and
pay the reasonable legal fees of the other Party incurred in connection with
such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom.

10.03 Interpretation. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the words
"include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the words
"herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole; (d) the word "extent" and the phrase "to the extent"
when used in this Agreement shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such word or phrase shall not merely mean "if"; (e) words
(including capitalized terms defined herein) in the singular shall be deemed
to include the plural and _ vice_ __ _ versa_ and words (including
capitalized terms defined herein) of one gender shall be deemed to include the
other gender as the context requires. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Seller Disclosure Schedules
and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Seller Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement,
instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the

and any regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever this Agreement refers to
a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business
Days are specified. Unless otherwise specified, time periods within or
following which any payment is to be made or act is to be done shall
be calculated by excluding the day on which the period commences and
including the day on which the period ends. Whenever any action must be taken
hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such action may be
validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day. The Parties have
participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement and if an
ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties thereto and no presumption of
burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening either Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision in this Agreement. The Seller Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with, and as an
integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein.

 



Page 64 10.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and
shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or the rights of the
Parties.

10.05 Severability. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

10.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous representations, warranties, understandings and agreements,
both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.

10.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, neither
Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; _provided that_ either Party may assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its direct or indirect
wholly owned Affiliates; _provided further, that,_ Buyer shall not assign
this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the
MSDLA, Initial Supply and Distribution Agreements or Initial Trademark License
Agreements relating to any territory other than the United States to any
Affiliate that is a U.S. Person. Any purported assignment without such prior
written consent shall be void. No assignment shall relieve the assigning Party
of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

10.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Article IX, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

10.09 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended,
modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each Party. No
waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver
by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any
failure, breach or default not expressly identified

 



Page 65  by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and
whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or
delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this
Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

10.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 



   (a) |

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and this Agreement and
all matters arising out of or relating in any way whatsoever to this
Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed by, the
law of the State of Delaware. 

---|--- 



   (b) |

All Proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement (including any
Proceeding to enforce the terms hereof) shall be litigated in and only in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware exclusive of any other court;
_provided that_ if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over any such dispute or aspect thereof, it shall be litigated
in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or, if there is jurisdiction
and proper venue, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, unless those Courts decline to exercise jurisdiction. Each Party
hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the aforementioned courts in
respect of any Proceeding, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, waives
any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any
such Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such
Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the
right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does
not have any jurisdiction over it; _provided that_ such submission to
jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 10.10 and
shall not be deemed to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of such
courts or any other courts other than for such purpose. 

---|--- 



   (c) |

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10(c).

and agent to receive, for and on its behalf service of process in such
jurisdiction in any Proceedings with respect to this Agreement or any other
agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, and such service shall
be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to the Buyer Process Agent. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable law. 

---|--- 

10.11 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the proof of actual
damages or posting any bond or any other security, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party hereto
acknowledges that prior to the Closing, the other Party will have the right to
specifically enforce such first Partys obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and pursuant to the
conditions hereof.

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures were upon the same instrument, and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered (by facsimile, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other Party.
Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
