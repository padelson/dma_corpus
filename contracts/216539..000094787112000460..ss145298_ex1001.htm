("Warrant Certificates") and may have such letters, numbers, or other marks of
identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed,

SECTION 3. Issuance of Warrants.

  

  

(a) Subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 8, each Warrant shall
entitle the Holder, upon proper exercise during the Exercise Period, to
purchase from the Company one (1) Share at a purchase price per Share equal to
$0.01 (such price being referred to herein as the "Exercise Price"), in each
case as adjusted from time to time as provided herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Warrant Certificates shall be dated the date of execution by the
Company and shall evidence one or more Warrants. Each Warrant evidenced
thereby entitles the Holder, upon proper exercise, to receive from the Company
the stated number of Warrant Shares at the Exercise Price, as adjusted as
provided herein.

  

  

SECTION 4. Execution of Warrant Certificates. The Warrant Certificates may be
executed in any number of original, facsimile or electronic counterparts and
each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument. Each such signature upon any Warrant Certificate may be of the
present or any future Officer of the Company, notwithstanding the fact that at
the time any Warrant Certificate shall be delivered or disposed of by the
Company such Officer shall have ceased to hold such office, so long as, and
the Company hereby represents that, under the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, any Warrants or Warrant Shares so issued would be
validly issued.

  

  

SECTION 5. Registration. The Company shall number and register the Warrant
Certificates in a register (the "Warrant Register") as they are issued by the
Company. The Warrant Register will show the name and address of the Holder,
the numbers of Warrants and Warrant Shares evidenced on the face of each
Warrant Certificate and the date of each Warrant Certificate. The Company may
deem and treat the Holder as the absolute owner of the Warrant Certificates
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by
anyone), for all purposes, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice
to the contrary.

  

  

SECTION 6. Transfers and Exchanges.

  

  

6.1 Transfers.

  

  

(a) The Holder may transfer, assign or encumber all or any part of a Warrant
Certificate to any Person, provided, however, that such transfer shall be in
compliance with the Securities Act or any state (or other jurisdiction)
securities or "blue sky" laws applicable to the Company or the Warrants.

  

  

(b) Upon written notice from the Holder of any transfer permitted pursuant to
Section 6.1(a) and receipt of such customary documents as the Company may
reasonably request to assure itself that such transfer is in compliance with
the Securities Act or any applicable state (or other jurisdiction) securities
or "blue sky" laws, the Company shall reflect in its records any change in
record ownership pursuant to any such transfer.

  

  

6.2 Exchange of Warrant Certificates. Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at
the option of the Holder, when surrendered to the Company during normal
business hours for another Warrant Certificate or other Warrant Certificates
of like tenor and representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants.
Warrant Certificates surrendered for exchange shall be cancelled by the
Company. Such cancelled Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by the
Company in accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 7. Exercise of Warrants.

  

  

7.1 Vesting of Warrants. The Warrants shall vest immediately upon the
execution of this Agreement.

  

  

7.2 Exercise of Warrants. A Warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the
Company of the Warrant Certificate evidencing the Warrant to be exercised with
the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof duly completed and
signed, and upon payment to the Company of the Exercise Price, as adjusted
from time to time as provided herein, for each Warrant Share then purchased.
Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price for all Warrant Shares being purchased
in respect of a Warrant shall be made (a) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. Dollars or (b) by certified or official bank check for
U.S. Dollars made payable to the order of the Company. Each Warrant not
exercised prior to the Expiration Date shall become void and all rights
thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease
as of such time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that its exercise of a Warrant for
Warrant Shares is subject to the condition that the Holder will have first
received any necessary Regulatory Approvals; provided, however, that in the
event the Holder has delivered a notice of exercise to the Company prior to
the Expiration Date and any Regulatory Approvals with respect to such exercise
are pending as of the Expiration Date, the Expiration Date with respect to
such Warrants shall automatically be extended for a period of 30 days
following final approval or disapproval of any such Regulatory Approval. The
Company agrees that if the exercise of any Warrant requires any Regulatory
Approval it will promptly provide the Holder all cooperation reasonably
requested to obtain such Regulatory Approvals.

  

  

7.3 Issuance of Certificates Representing Shares. Upon such surrender of
Warrant Certificates and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (unless such
exercise is pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof (in which case no Exercise Price
shall be due)), the Company shall cause to be delivered promptly to, or upon
the written order of, the Holder, and in such name or names as the Holder may
designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares
issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants together with cash in lieu of
fractional Shares as provided in Section 7.8. Such certificate or certificates
shall be deemed to have been issued and any Person so designated to be named
therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of such Warrant Shares as of
the date of the surrender of such Warrants Certificates and, if applicable,
payment of the aggregate Exercise Price.

  

  

7.4 Issuance of New Warrant Certificates. Each Warrant shall be exercisable at
the election of the Holder thereof, either in full or from time to time in
part (in whole numbers of Warrant Shares), and, in the event that a Warrant is
exercised (and a Warrant Certificate is surrendered) in respect of fewer than
all of the Warrant Shares issuable on such exercise at any time prior to the
Expiration Date, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the remaining Warrant or
Warrants will be issued and delivered by the Company.

  

  

7.5 Cancellation of Warrant Certificates. All Warrant Certificates surrendered
upon exercise of Warrants shall be cancelled and disposed of by the Company in
accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.6 Warrant Agreement. The Company shall keep copies of this Agreement and any
notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the Holder
during normal business hours at its office.

  

  

7.7 Alternative Cashless Exercise. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, in lieu of exercising a Warrant as set forth above, the Holder may
exercise a Warrant by electing to receive that number of Shares as determined
below by surrendering to the Company such Warrant Certificate, with the
applicable election to purchase such Share(s) duly completed and signed by the
Holder, in which event the Company shall deliver to the Holder the number of
Shares computed using the following formula:

  

  

 

     |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|--- 
   |  

S

  |  

=

  |  

WS (MP - PP) 
 

  |   
   |  |  |  

MP

  |   
 

 

  

  

where:

  

  

"S" equals the net number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder;

  

  

"WS" equals the number of Warrant Shares purchasable under the Warrant or, if
only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant
being exercised;

  

  

"MP" equals the Current Market Price; and

  

  

"PP" equals the Exercise Price.

  

  

Following the surrender of any Warrant pursuant to this Section 7.7, the
Company shall promptly record the name of the Holder in the Warrant Register
for that number of Shares, as calculated above, or in such name or names as
may be designated by such Holder.

  

  

7.8 Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to deliver fractional
Warrant Shares on the exercise of any Warrant. If more than one Warrant shall
be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same Holder, the
number of full Warrant Shares which shall be deliverable upon the exercise
thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrant
Shares purchasable on exercise of the Warrants so presented. If any fraction
of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 7.8, be
deliverable on the exercise of any Warrants (or specified portion thereof),
the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the Market Price multiplied
by such fraction.

  

  

7.9 When Exercise Effective. The exercise of any Warrant shall be deemed to
have been effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Business
Day on which such Warrant is surrendered to and, unless such exercise is
pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof (in which case no Exercise Price shall be due),
the Exercise Price is received by the Company as provided in this Section 7
(the "Exercise Date") and the Person in whose name the Shares shall be
issuable upon such exercise shall be deemed to be the holder of such Shares
for all purposes on the Exercise Date.

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 8. Adjustment of Exercise Price. If any of the events set forth in
this Section 8 occur during the Exercise Period, the Exercise Price and the
number of Warrant Shares for which any Warrant is exercisable, as applicable,
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section
8; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 8 is
applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces
the largest adjustment in favor of the Holder (as determined by the Board in
good faith). All of the adjustments referred to in this Section 8 shall only
apply to Warrants which have not yet been exercised and shall not apply the
issuance of any Warrant Shares upon exercise of any Warrant (or the initial
issuance of Warrants pursuant to this Agreement).

  

  

8.1 Adjustments for Change in Shares. If at any time the Company shall:

  

  

(a) make a distribution on its Shares payable in Additional Shares or shares
of other Capital Stock;

  

  

(b) subdivide its outstanding Shares into a greater number of Shares;

  

  

(c) combine its outstanding Shares into a smaller number of Shares; or

  

  

(d) issue by reclassification of the Shares any shares of its Capital Stock
(other than rights, warrants or options for its Shares);

  

  

then (i) the aggregate number of Warrant Shares for which any Warrant is
exercisable immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the
Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise of such Warrant the number
of Shares that the Holder would have owned or would have been entitled to
receive immediately following such action if the Holder had exercised such
Warrant immediately prior to such action and (ii) the Exercise Price payable
upon the exercise of such Warrant shall be adjusted by multiplying such
Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the
exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the
denominator of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares issuable
immediately thereafter.

  


 

  

8.2 Adjustment for Rights Issue.

  

  

(a) If the Company distributes any rights, warrants, options or other
securities exercisable or convertible into or exchangeable (collectively, an
"Exercise") for Shares (collectively, "Rights") to all holders of its Shares
entitling them to purchase Shares at a price per Share (or having an exercise
price per Share) less than the Market Price of the Shares as of the last
Trading Day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing such rights, then,
in such event:

  

  

(i) the number of Warrant Shares for which any Warrant is exercisable
immediately prior to the date of the agreement on pricing of such Rights (the
"Initial Number") shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the
Initial Number by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of
(1) the number of Shares outstanding on such date on a fully diluted basis
(i.e., taking into account any previously issued Rights (including the
Warrants) exercisable for Shares then outstanding) and (2) the number of
Additional Shares for which Rights then being issued may be Exercised and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(B) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of Shares
outstanding on such date on a fully diluted basis (i.e., taking into account
any previously issued Rights (including the Warrants) exercisable for Shares
then outstanding) and (2) the number of Shares which the aggregate
consideration receivable by the Company for the total number of Shares for
which Rights then being issued may be Exercised would purchase at the Market
Price on the last Trading Day preceding the date of the agreement on pricing
such Rights; and

  

  

(ii) the Exercise Price payable upon exercise of a Warrant shall be adjusted
by multiplying such Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the date of
the agreement on pricing of such Rights by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the number of Warrant Shares prior to such date and the denominator
of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares immediately after the
adjustment described in Section 8.2(a)(i).

  

  

(b) For purposes of the foregoing, the aggregate consideration receivable by
the Company in connection with the issuance of such Rights shall be deemed to
be equal to the sum of the net offering price (including the fair market
value, as determined by the Investment Bank, of any non-cash consideration and
after deduction of any related expenses payable to third parties) of all such
Rights plus the minimum aggregate amount, if any, payable upon exercise of any
such Rights into Shares. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8.2
shall become effective immediately upon the date of such issuance.

  

  

8.3 Adjustment for Other Non-Cash Distributions.

  

  

(a) If the Company distributes to all holders of its Shares any of its non-
cash assets, equity interests of the Company other than Shares or debt
securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the
Company or other equity interests of the Company other than Shares (including
securities but excluding distributions of Shares referred to in Section 8.1,
distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 8.2 and
any spin-off as described in Section 8.3(c)), the Exercise Price shall be
adjusted in accordance with the formula:

  

  

E′ = E - F

  

  

where:

  

  

E\' = the adjusted Exercise Price;

  

  

E = the current Exercise Price; and

  

  

F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which
this Section 8.3(a) applies) of the assets, securities, rights, warrants or
options to be distributed in respect of each Share in the distribution to
which this Section 8.3(a) is being applied.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Investment Bank shall determine fair market values for the purposes of
this Section 8.3. The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the
distribution to which this Section 8.3 applies.

  

  

(c) In respect of a distribution of Shares of any class or series, or Capital
Stock or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary of the
Company or other business unit, referred to herein as a "spin-off," for
purposes of the adjustment in Section 8.3(a) above, "F" shall be equal to the
average of the closing price of the portion of those shares of Capital Stock
or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one Share for the ten
(10) consecutive Trading Days beginning on the effective day of the spin-off
or, if such shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests are not listed
on any national or regional securities exchange or quoted in the over-the-
counter market, the fair value thereof shall be determined by the Investment
Bank. The adjustment to the Exercise Price in the event of a spin-off will
occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the
spin-off.

  

  

8.4 Adjustment for Cash Distributions. In case the Company shall pay an annual
cash distribution per Share, excluding any distribution in connection with the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, then, in such case, the Exercise Price shall be decreased by the
amount of the cash distribution per Share payable to the holder of one Share,
such adjustment to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business
on the day following such record date. If any such distribution is not so
paid, the Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price that
would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.

  

  

8.5 Certain Repurchases of Shares.

  

  

(a) In case the Company effects a Pro Rata Repurchase in which the cash and
value of any other consideration included in the payment per Share exceeds the
Market Price on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders
or exchanges may be made pursuant to such Pro Rata Repurchase, then the
Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the
Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of such Pro
Rata Repurchase by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be (A) the
product of (1) the number of Shares outstanding immediately before such Pro
Rata Repurchase and (2) the Market Price of a Share on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of
its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (B) the
aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, and of which (ii) the
denominator shall be the product of (A) the number of Shares outstanding
immediately before such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of Shares so
repurchased and (B) the Market Price of a Share on the Trading Day immediately
preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any of its
Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase.

  

  

(b) In such event, the number of Warrant Shares for which any Warrant is
exercisable shall be increased to the number obtained by dividing (i) the
product of (A) the number of Warrant Shares before such adjustment, and (B)
the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase
giving rise to this adjustment by (ii) the new Exercise Price determined in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, no increase to the Exercise Price or decrease
in the number of Warrant Shares shall be made pursuant to this Section 8.5.

  

  

8.6 Other Provisions Applicable to Adjustments Under this Section 8. The
following provisions shall be applicable to the making of adjustments of the
Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares hereinbefore provided for in this
Section 8, irrespective of the accounting treatment of any consideration
described below:

  

  

(a) When Adjustments to be Made. The adjustments required by this Section 8
shall be made whenever and as often as any specified event requiring an
adjustment shall occur. For the purpose of any adjustment, any specified event
shall be deemed to have occurred at the close of business on the date of its
occurrence.

  

  

(b) When Adjustments May Be Deferred. No adjustment in the Exercise Price
needs to be made if the amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01.
Any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment and all adjustments that are made and
carried forward shall be taken in the aggregate in order to determine if the
$0.01 threshold is met. In computing adjustments under this Section 8,
fractional interests in Shares shall be taken into account to the nearest one-
hundredth of a Share.

  

  

(c) When Adjustment Not Required. If the Company shall take a record of the
holders of Shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive a distribution
or subscription or purchase rights and shall, thereafter and before the
distribution thereof to the holders of Shares, legally abandon its plan to pay
or deliver such dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then
no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of such record and any
such adjustment previously made in respect thereof shall be rescinded and
annulled, and no adjustment to the Exercise Price or number of Warrant Shares
under this Section 8 shall be made in respect of the Warrants held by the
Holder.

  

  

(d) Limitation on Number of Warrant Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, no adjustment to the number of Warrant
Shares shall be made pursuant to this Section 8 which, under the Company's
organizational documents, Virginia law, the rules of the NYSE or otherwise,
would have the effect of requiring the Company to seek approval from its
shareholders (assuming that all of the Warrants outstanding under this
Agreement were exercised for Warrant Shares).

  

  

SECTION 9. Consolidation and Merger.

  

  

9.1 Consolidation and Merger. In the event that any transaction, whether by
way of consolidation, merger, transfer or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, or other transaction that has substantially the
same effect, shall be effected with another Person after the date hereof and
the Company shall not be the surviving entity, or the Company shall be the
surviving entity but its Shares shall be changed into securities or other
property of another Person which is not an Affiliate of the Company
immediately prior to such transaction (each such transaction, a "Change of
Control"), then, as a condition of such Change of Control, lawful and adequate
provision shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the right to
purchase and receive,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

upon the exercise of its Warrants, on the basis and the terms and conditions
specified herein (and in lieu of each Warrant Share immediately theretofore
purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the Warrants), such
securities, cash or other property receivable upon such Change of Control as
such Holder would have been entitled to receive if its Warrants had been
exercised immediately prior to such event in accordance with Section 9.3. The
Company shall not effect any such Change of Control unless prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor Person (if other
than the Company) resulting from such Change of Control shall assume, by
written instrument, the obligation to deliver to such Holder such securities,
cash or other property as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such
Holder may be entitled to upon the exercise of its Warrants. The above
provisions of this Section 9.1 shall similarly apply to successive
consolidations, mergers or other transactions that have substantially the same
effect as a Change of Control.

  

  

9.2 Dilution in Case of Other Securities. In the event that all the Shares of
the Company are or will be converted or exchanged for Other Securities in a
transaction which does not qualify as a Change of Control pursuant to Section
9.1, then upon such conversion or exchange, the Warrant shall become
exercisable for such Other Securities, and the computations, adjustments and
readjustments provided for in Section 8 with respect to the Exercise Price and
Warrant Shares shall be made as nearly as possible in the manner so provided
and applied to determine the Exercise Price and amount of Other Securities
from time to time receivable upon the exercise of the Warrants. In any such
case, appropriate and equitable provision shall be made with respect to the
rights and interests of the Holder to the end that the provisions hereof
(including Section 8 hereof) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may
be, in relation to any securities, cash or other property thereafter
deliverable upon the exercise of any Warrants (such that, for greater clarity,
the provisions of Section 8 shall read as if references therein to Shares
referred to the Other Securities or other equity interests issuable on the
exercise of the Warrants, mutatis mutandis).

  


 

  

9.3 Alternative Settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if there shall
occur a Change of Control for cash consideration then the Company shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to the Holder, concurrent with the completion of the
transaction, the amount of the Warrants (calculated in the same manner as a
cashless exercise pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof, provided that the Current
Market Price shall be deemed to be the value of the consideration being
delivered in exchange for the Shares in the Change of Control), and the
Warrants shall thereafter not be exercisable and (ii) if there shall occur a
Change of Control for consideration that includes cash and non-cash
consideration, then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the Holder,
concurrent with the completion of the transaction and in the same allocation
of cash and non-cash consideration as is paid to holders of Shares, such
consideration for that number of Shares that the Warrants (calculated in the
same manner as a cashless exercise pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof, provided
that the Current Market Price shall be deemed to be the volume weighted
average price of the Shares for the 30-day period prior to the date of the
completion of the transaction), with the value of any fractional Shares to be
paid in cash, and the Warrants shall thereafter not be exercisable.

  


 

  

SECTION 10. Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Warrants or Exercise Price
shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 8 or Section 9.2, the Company shall
forthwith provide a certificate signed by an Officer, setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which
such adjustment was calculated and describing the number and kind of any other
securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and any change in the
Exercise Price after giving effect to such adjustment or change.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

The Company shall promptly, and in any case within 10 Business Days after the
making of such adjustment, cause a signed copy of such certificate to be
delivered to the Holder in accordance with Section 17.1. The Company shall
keep at its principal executive offices referred to in Section 17.1 copies of
all such certificates and cause the same to be available for inspection at
said office during normal business hours by the Holder.

  

  

SECTION 11. Payment of Taxes; Adjustments Resulting in Taxes. No service
charge shall be made to any Holder for any exercise, exchange or registration
of transfer of Warrant Certificates, and the Company will pay all documentary
or stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares or upon
the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue of any Warrant Certificates or any certificates
for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a
Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent that
any adjustments to the Warrants or the Exercise Price, whether pursuant to
Section 3(a), Section 8, Section 9.2 or otherwise, would cause the Holder to
incur a tax liability, the Holder shall have 15 Business Days after receipt of
the signed certificate pursuant to Section 10 to notify the Company in writing
that the Holder does not accept such adjustment to the Warrants or the
Exercise Price so adjusted in whole or in part, in which case such adjustments
shall not be made. The Company shall be required to withhold and deduct any
taxes required to be withheld and deducted under applicable law in connection
with an adjustment to the Warrants or the Exercise Price hereunder, or upon
the exercise or settlement of the Warrants.

  

  

SECTION 12. Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates. If any of the Warrant
Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall
issue, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated
Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant
Certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like date
and tenor and representing an equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon
receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft
or destruction of such Warrant Certificate and such indemnity and security
therefor as is customary and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, if
requested. Applicants for such substitute Warrant Certificate shall also
comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable
charges as the Company may prescribe.

  

  

SECTION 13. Covenants with Respect to Shares.

  

  

(a) Delivery of Shares. The Company agrees to take all actions and do all
things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit it to deliver the
Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants. The Company guarantees to the
Holder the performance of the Company's obligations to deliver the Warrant
Shares in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Reservation of Shares. The Company will, commencing on the date hereof and
at all times subsequent thereto until the sooner of the expiration of the
Exercise Period or the exercise of all of the Warrants by the Holders thereof,
reserve and keep available, out of the aggregate of its authorized but
unissued Shares or its authorized and issued Shares held in treasury, for the
purpose of enabling it to provide Shares (directly or indirectly) such that
the Company may satisfy any obligation to deliver Warrant Shares upon exercise
of Warrants, the maximum number of Shares which may then be deliverable upon
the exercise of all outstanding Warrants.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Stock Exchange Listing. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the listing of the Shares on the NYSE for a period of at
least the Exercise Period for each Warrant unless the Company undergoes a
Change of Control.

  

  

SECTION 14. Notices of Certain Corporate Actions.

  

  

(a) In case:

  

  

(i) the Company proposes to take any action that would require an adjustment
to the Exercise Price or the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants pursuant to Section 8 or Section 9.2;

  

  

(ii) of a Change of Control; or

  

  

(iii) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the Company;

  

  

then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Holder at
its address as set forth in the Warrant Register, at least 20 Business Days
prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, or promptly in the
case of events for which there is no record date, by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, a written notice stating (A)(1) if applicable, the date as of which
the Holders to be entitled to receive any such rights, options, warrants or
distribution are to be determined or (2) if applicable, the initial expiration
date set forth in any tender offer or exchange offer for Shares or (3) if
applicable, the date on which any such Change of Control, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or consummated, and
the date as of which it is expected that Holders shall be entitled to exchange
such Shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such
Change of Control, dissolution, liquidation or winding up and (B) the facts
with respect thereto as shall reasonably be necessary to indicate the effect
on the Exercise Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other
securities or property which shall be deliverable upon exercise of any
Warrants. The failure to give the notice required by this Section 14(a) or any
defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution,
right, option, warrant, Change of Control, dissolution, liquidation or winding
up, or the vote upon any action.

  

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon
the Holder the right to vote or consent to or receive notice as a shareholder
in respect of the meetings of shareholders or the right to receive
distributions or the right to receive the net assets of the Company upon the
winding-up or termination of the Company or any other matter, or any rights
whatsoever as shareholders of the Company.

  

  

SECTION 15. Expenses. All expenses incident to the Company's performance of or
compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, including: (a)
all expenses of printing Warrant Certificates; (b) messenger and delivery
services and telephone calls; (c) all fees and disbursements of counsel for
the Company; (d) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public
accountants or knowledgeable experts selected by the Company; and (e) the
Company's internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of their
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties).

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 16. Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

  

  

16.1 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Company. The Company

(c) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Holder,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company.

  

  

(d) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation and performance of the transactions contemplated hereby, will
not (i) contravene the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii)
violate any Law or (iii) conflict with or result in the breach of, or
constitute a default or require any payment to be made under, any contract,
loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other instrument
binding on or affecting the Company.

  

  

(e) The Company is authorized to issue 75,000,000 of Shares, and as April 29,
2012, there were 22,799,273 Shares issued and outstanding and 548,564 shares
of the Company's Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding. Immediately
prior to giving effect to this Agreement, there are no outstanding (i)
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other equity interests
of the Company, or phantom stock, stock appreciation rights or similar plans
of the Company, or (ii) agreements or other rights to convert any obligation
into, or exchange any securities for, Shares or other equity interests of the
Company, other than as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 2012.

  

  

(f) The Warrant Shares have been duly and validly authorized for issuance and,
when issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and the Warrants, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-
asssessable, free and clear of any liens, claims, adverse interests or other
encumbrances and will conform to the existing Shares.

  

  

(g) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the
Holder, no consent, approval, authorization, finding of suitability,
registration, exemption or permit or (other than informational filings or
notices) any filing with or notice to any Governmental Authority or any third
party that is a party to any of the documents, to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, is required in connection with, or as a condition
to, the execution, delivery or performance by the parties of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

16.2 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Holder. The Holder
hereby represents, warrants and covenants the following to the Company:

  

  

(a) The Holder has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Holder and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Holder.

  

  

(c) The execution and delivery by the Holder of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation and performance of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not
(i) contravene the Holder's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
equivalent governing documents, as applicable, (ii) violate any Law or (iii)
conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require
any payment to be made under, any contract, loan agreement, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other instrument binding on or affecting the
Holder.

  

  

(d) The Warrants being acquired by the Holder pursuant to this Agreement are
being acquired for its own account and with no intention of distributing or
reselling such Warrants or the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise thereof
or any part thereof in any transaction that would be in violation of the
securities Laws of the United States, any state of the United States or any
foreign jurisdiction, without prejudice, however, to the rights of such Holder
at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Warrants
(in accordance with this Agreement) or Warrant Shares in a transaction that
does not violate the Securities Act under an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, or under an exemption from such registration
available under the Securities Act. If such Holder should in the future decide
to dispose of any of such Warrants or Warrant Shares, such Holder understands
and agrees that it may do so only in compliance with the Securities Act and
applicable state and foreign securities Laws, as then applicable and in effect
and, in the case of the Warrants, in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Such Holder understands that (i) the Warrants and the Warrant Shares will
not be registered at the time of their issuance under the Securities Act for
the reason that the sale provided for in this Agreement and upon exercise of
Warrants is exempt pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, (ii) the
reliance of the Company on such exemption is predicated in part on such
Holder's representations set forth herein, and (iii) such Warrants and Warrant
Shares must be held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition thereof is
registered under the Securities Act or is exempt from such registration.

  

  

(f) Such Holder has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has the ability to bear the
economic risks of the investment and is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D, promulgated under the Securities Act.

would occur in the event any provision of the Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties hereto shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
at law or in equity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

17.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (i) in an
instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Company and the Holder
or (ii) by a waiver in accordance with Section 17.4.

  

  

17.4 Waiver. Any party to this Agreement may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other party or conditions to such party's obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to assert
any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such
rights.

  

  

17.5 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto as
hereinafter provided.

  

  

17.6 Headings. The descriptive headings and subheadings in this Agreement are
included for convenience and identification only and are in no way intended to
describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

  

  

17.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York. All Actions
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan; provided, however, that if such
federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall
be heard and determined exclusively in any state court sitting in the City of
New York, Borough of Manhattan. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
or state court sitting in City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

  

  

17.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held to
be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law, or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon a determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of
employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

17.11 Termination. Subject to Section 7.2, this Agreement shall terminate on
the Expiration Date, after which time this Agreement and all Warrants shall no
longer be of any force or effect; provided, however, that this Agreement will
terminate on such earlier date on which all outstanding Warrants have been
exercised; provided, further, that provisions of Sections 15, 16 and this
Section 17 shall survive such termination.

  

  

17.12 Interpretation and Rules of Construction. In this Agreement, except to
the extent otherwise provided or that the context otherwise requires:

[Reverse of Warrant Certificate]

  

  

MEDIA GENERAL, INC.

  

  

By accepting a Warrant Certificate, the Holder shall be bound by all of the
terms and provisions of the Warrant Agreement (a copy of which is available on
request to the Secretary of the Company) and any amendments thereto as fully
and effectively as if such Holder had signed the same.

  

  

The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are part of a duly
authorized issue of Warrants by the Company expiring on the Expiration Date,
entitling the Holder upon proper exercise to receive Warrant Shares pursuant
to the Warrant Agreement, which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by
reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for
a description of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company and each Holder of the Warrants.
Capitalized terms used but not other otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Warrant Agreement.

  

  

The Holder of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise
them by surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to
purchase set forth below on this Warrant Certificate, properly completed and
executed, together with payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in
the case of cashless exercise pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Warrant
Agreement) in accordance with the provisions set forth on the face of this
Warrant Certificate and in the Warrant Agreement. In the event that upon any
exercise of Warrants evidenced hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall
be less than the total number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be
issued to the Holder hereof or his assignee a new Warrant Certificate
evidencing the number of Warrants not exercised.

  

  

The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events the
Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant, each as set forth on the face hereof, may, subject to certain
conditions, be adjusted. No fractions of a Warrant Share will be issued upon
the exercise of any Warrant, but the Company will pay the cash value in lieu
thereof determined as provided in the Warrant Agreement.

  

  

Warrant Certificates, when surrendered to the Company by the Holder thereof in
person or by legal representative or attorney duly authorized in writing, may
be exchanged, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the
Warrant Agreement, but without payment of any service charge, for another
Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the
aggregate a like number of Warrants.

  

  

Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of this Warrant Certificate
to the Company, a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like
tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants shall be
issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this Warrant Certificate, subject
to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, without charge.

  

  

The Company may deem and treat the Holder(s) hereof as the absolute owner(s)
of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or
other writing hereon made by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof,
of any distribution to the Holder(s) hereof, and for all other purposes, and
the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

The Warrant Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
supplementing or amendment thereof in writing at any time by the Company and
the Holder. Any such amendment shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Warrant and any Warrant issued upon
the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange thereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon such Warrant or any other Warrant.
