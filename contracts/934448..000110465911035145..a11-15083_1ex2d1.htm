reasonable comments). Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary all of the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer (including pursuant to any Subsequent Offering
Period), and shall cause Merger Subsidiary to perform, on a timely basis, all
of Merger Subsidiarys obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Nothing in this Section 2.01 shall affect any termination rights in
Section 11.01.

 



 

Section 2.02 _. Company Action. _(a) The Company has been advised that all of
its directors and executive officers who own Shares intend to tender their
Shares pursuant to the Offer. In connection with the Offer and subject to the
occurrence of an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section
7.04(b)(ii), the Company shall, or shall instruct its transfer agent to,
promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels,
security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record or
beneficial holders of the Shares, in each case true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional
information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer. Except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their Affiliates, associates,
agents and advisors, shall keep such information confidential and use the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer terminate or if
this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver (and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to
deliver) to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession.

 



 

(b) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act, file with the SEC
and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act), the Schedule 14D-9 that,
subject to its right to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation pursuant
to Section 7.04(b)(ii), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the
Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act (regardless of whether such item
is applicable). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply with the applicable requirements
of the 1934 Act and (ii) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , no covenant is

 



      
 

 



 

made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 (including any such information
included in the Information Statement). The Company shall cause the
information supplied by it specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents,
at the respective times the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, not to
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 (including the Information Statement), if and to the extent that such
information shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Applicable Law.
The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by Applicable Law (including the 1934 Act). Prior to an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 7.04(b)(ii), Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the
SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to any reasonable comments
made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. Prior to an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 7.04(b)(ii), the Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) copies of
any written comments or other communications, and shall inform them of any
oral communications that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to
provide comments on that response (to which due consideration shall be given
to reasonable comments), including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. The Company shall respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

(c) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to Parent
and Merger Subsidiary all information concerning the Company that may be
required by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary for inclusion in the Schedule TO and Offer Documents.

 



 

Section 2.03 _. Directors. _(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and for so
long thereafter as Parent and its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly own in
the aggregate more than 50% of the outstanding Shares, Parent shall be
entitled to designate for appointment or election to the Board of Directors,
upon written notice to the Company, the number of directors, rounded up to the
nearest whole number, on the Board of Directors that equals the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the
election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 2.03) and (ii)
the percentage that the

 



      
 

 



 

number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary
(including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares
then outstanding, and the Company, upon request of Parent, shall promptly
cause Parents designees (and any replacement designees in the event that any
designee shall no longer be on the Board of Directors) to be elected or
appointed to the Board of Directors, including by increasing the number of
directors, seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors or
amending the Company Bylaws as is necessary to give effect to the foregoing
provision; _provided_ that, prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors shall always have at least three Continuing Directors. At such time,
the Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Board of Directors and (B) as
requested by Parent, each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board of Directors, in each case to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and the rules of Nasdaq. The provisions of this
Section 2.03(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Merger
Subsidiary, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.

 



 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.03, including mailing to the
stockholders of the Company the information required by such Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9 so
long as Parent shall have timely provided to the Company all information with
respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and Affiliates
required by Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder). Parent
shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 



 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
(the " **Continuing Directors** ") shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and
no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize): (i) any termination
of this Agreement by the Company, (ii)) any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Board of Directors, (iii) any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary, (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company and (v) any other
consent, action or recommendation by the Company or the Board of Directors
with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated thereby or in connection therewith. The Continuing
Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the
Company as determined appropriate by the Continuing Directors and shall have
the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the
performance of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Board
of Directors pursuant to Section 2.03(a), until the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to ensure that the Board of
Directors shall have at least such number of directors as may be required by
the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules or the federal securities laws who are considered
independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws.

 



 

Section 2.04 _. Top-Up Option. _(a) Subject to Sections 2.04(b) and 2.04(c),
the Company grants to Merger Subsidiary, an irrevocable option, for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the
" **Top-Up Option** "), to purchase from the Company, a number of authorized
and unissued Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares owned by Merger Subsidiary at the time of the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, constitutes not less than the number of Shares required to
reach the Short Form Threshold after the issuance of all Shares to be issued
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, the " **Top-Up Shares** ").

 



 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in
part, only once, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Acceptance Time, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, following
the expiration date of such Subsequent Offering Period, and only if Merger
Subsidiary shall own as of such time less than the number of Shares required
to reach the Short Form Threshold; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable,
and there shall be no obligation of Merger Subsidiary to exercise the Top Up
Option, (i) unless there are sufficient authorized but unissued and unreserved
Shares as provided in the Company Certificate such that exercise of the Top-Up
Option would result in the Short Form Threshold being reached, (ii) if any
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-
Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares and (iii) unless Parent or
Merger Subsidiary has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the
Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 11. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-
Up Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Top-Up Option
shall be determined by

 



      
 

 



 

multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without
interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger Subsidiary, at its
election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares and by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any such promissory note
shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Without the prior written consent
of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be assigned by Merger Subsidiary except to any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this Section 2.04(b) shall be null and void.

 



 

(c) In the event Merger Subsidiary is obligated to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company a written notice (the " **Top-
Up Notice** ") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger
Subsidiary intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner
in which Merger Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase price and
(iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up
Shares by Merger Subsidiary is to take place. The Company shall make available
to Parent and Merger Subsidiary all information reasonably requested by them
to enable them to calculate the number of Shares required for Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to reach the Short Form Threshold. The Top-Up Notice shall
also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that,
promptly following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary
intends to (and Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to, promptly after such exercise) consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 253 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 9.05.
At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Subsidiary a certificate representing the
Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same
day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to
Section 12.01, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter
as possible. At the request of Parent, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its transfer agent not to, issue or deliver any Shares in satisfaction of the
exercise of any Options or Warrants from the time of delivery to the Company
of the Top-Up Notice until the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option
is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger Subsidiary

 



      
 

 



 

for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933 Act.
Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required
by applicable securities laws.

 



 

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of
the fair value of any dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware
Law as contemplated by Section 3.04.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3** 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 3.01 _. The Merger. _(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the " **Merger** ") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving
Corporation** ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk
and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 no later than
two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those
conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or
at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be
executed and filed a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time
(the " **Effective Time** ") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with
the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be mutually
agreed upon by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company and specified in the
certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the property, rights, powers, privileges, immunities and franchises and be
subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities
of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

Section 3.02 _. Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any of their respective securities:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b) or Section 3.04, each
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " **Merger
Consideration** "), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by Applicable Law, upon (i)
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Shares or (ii) receipt
of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in the case of uncertificated
Shares, in each case in accordance with Section 3.03. As of the Effective
Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned of record by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 3.03 _. Surrender and Payment. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company or similar entity reasonably
acceptable to the Company which is authorized to exercise corporate trust or
stock powers to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " **Paying Agent** ")
for the purpose of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
the Paying Agent funds representing the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of (i) certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii) uncertificated
Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ") pursuant to Section 3.02(a) (the "
**Paying Agent Fund** "). The Paying Agent Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Paying Agent
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Paying Agent Fund lost through
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Paying Agent Fund is, at
all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time, which
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or
the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) for use in such exchange. Each holder
of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as Parent and the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share, less any withholding of Taxes
required by Applicable Law; _provided, however,_ that each payment to a holder
of Shares acquired upon the exercise of Company 102 Options that are held by
the 102 Trustee shall be paid to the 102 Trustee in accordance with the
Israeli Options Tax Ruling, if obtained, and the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance.
Any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, that
such documentation as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent is
provided and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in, this Article 3.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned

 



      
 

 



 

thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look to Parent only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.03, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate of Uncertificated Shares for any amount paid or delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 



 

Section 3.04 _. Dissenting Shares. _Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance, and who
complies in all respects, with Section 262 of with Delaware Law (such Shares,
the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with, and to the extent provided by, Section 262 of Delaware Law. If, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right
to appraisal, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any withholding of Taxes required by Applicable Law. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of Shares and any attempted withdrawals of such demands, and
Parent, at its expense, shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands so long as Parent does not create
obligations for the Company prior to the Effective Time. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 3.05 _. Stock Options. _(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares (each, an " **Option** ") outstanding
under any employee plan that provides for equity-based compensation (each, an
" **Option Plan** ") that is (i) then outstanding, vested and exercisable
(including for such purpose any such Option that will vest and become
exercisable at the Effective Time in accordance with its terms or in
accordance with any applicable employment agreement or other Employee Plan)
(collectively, the " **Exercisable Options** ") or (ii) not an Exercisable
Option and that is held by a non-employee director of the Company
(collectively, together with the Exercisable Options, the " **Cashout
Options** ") shall be canceled, and the Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company shall pay each holder of any such Option at or as soon

 



      
 

 



 

as practicable after the Effective Time for each such Option an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the
applicable per Share exercise price of such Option by (y) the number of Shares
such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such amounts payable
with respect to Company 102 Options that are held by the 102 Trustee shall be
paid to the 102 Trustee in accordance with the Israeli Options Tax Ruling, if
obtained, and the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance. Section 3.05(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each Option that
will vest and become exercisable as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, assuming a Closing Date of July 31, 2011, including the
holder thereof, the number of Shares subject to such Option, the grant date of
such Option and the per-Share Option exercise price.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and not then vested
and exercisable shall be converted into an option to purchase, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Option
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights
and vesting and acceleration provisions), the number of common shares of
Parent (" **Parent Shares** ") (rounded down to the next whole share) equal to
(i) the number of Shares subject to such Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Rollover Exchange Ratio, at an exercise
price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the
exercise price per Share subject to such Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (y) the Rollover Exchange Ratio (such Option, as
adjusted and converted pursuant to this Section 3.05(b), an " **Assumed
Option** "). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the adjustment described
in this Section 3.05(b) shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 409A
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and, with respect to each
such Option that is an incentive stock option (within the meaning of Section
422(b) of the Code), shall be made in a manner that will not cause there to be
a modification (within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code) to such
Option. The parties agree and acknowledge that the conversion described in
this Section 3.05(b) is not intended to result in a disqualification of any
such Option as "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of
Section 162(m) of the Code, and agree not to take any position inconsistent
therewith. " **Rollover Exchange Ratio** " means a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Offer Price and the denominator of which is the average (for the
avoidance of doubt, not the volume weighted average) of the volume weighted
average price per Parent Share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (as reported
on the Bloomberg Financial Markets or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on each of
the five consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day
prior to the date of the Effective Time, weighted by the total volume of
trading in Parent Shares on each such trading day, calculated to the nearest
one-tenth of one cent.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any required consents from, and provide any required notice
to, holders of Options and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of the Option
Plans that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, payment or
conversion, as applicable, may be withheld in respect of any Option until any
required consents are obtained.

 



 

Section 3.06 _. Warrants. _At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Warrant shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted, in
full satisfaction of the rights of the holder of such Warrant with respect
thereto, into the right to receive, an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the applicable
exercise price of such Warrant by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), at any time from the date
hereof and prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article 11; provided that the Company has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 7.04(a):

 



 

(i) if the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives,

constitutes a Superior Proposal or (2) which the Board of Directors determines
in good faith could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and (B) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel that the failure of the Board of Directors to take
the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then the Company may: (x) furnish
non-public information to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal
(if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company
receives from the Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement with

Change and/or Superior Termination in response to such Superior Proposal,
which notice shall in addition specify the material terms and conditions
(including price) of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal), and
contemporaneously with providing such notice shall have provided a copy of the
relevant proposed acquisition agreement;

 



 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with

 



      
 

 



 

outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 7.04; _provided_ that any such action
taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act (which it is agreed shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change). If, following the issuance of any "stop, look and listen" disclosure
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
1934 Act pursuant to this Section 7.04(b), the Board of Directors discontinues
negotiations or discussions related to such Acquisition Proposal and decides
not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Termination with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors shall, within two
Business Days of such decision, reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation.

 



 

(c) _Required Notices_. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly
(but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, including of the material
terms and conditions thereof, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to
the status (including changes to the material terms) of such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has informed the Company that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Superior Proposal** " means a _bona
fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, for the
purposes of this definition, references to "15%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed replaced with references to "80%") on
terms that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after considering the advice of a financial advisor and outside legal counsel
(with respect to matters of a legal nature), and taking into account all
relevant factors, (i) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated on
the terms proposed, and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction
more favorable, from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders
than as provided hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,

 



      
 

 



 

discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. In addition, to the extent it has
the contractual authority to do so, the Company shall request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
any Person in respect an Acquisition Proposal prior to the date hereof and not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

 



 

Section 7.05 _. Employee Matters. _The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
comply with all obligations under any Applicable Laws to notify and/or consult
with any non-U.S. employees or other service providers or any of their
employee representatives, unions, works councils or other representative
bodies, if any, and shall provide to Parent such information and access to
such employees, service providers or representatives as may required for
Parent to comply with any notification and/or consultation obligations, in
each case in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.06 _. Compensation Arrangements. _Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that
are reasonably necessary to cause each Compensation Arrangement entered into
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof and each
Employment Agreement to be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised
solely of "independent directors" determined in the manner described in the
last sentence of Section 5.17(j)) as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the 1934 Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act.

 



 

Section 7.07 _. Israeli Tax Rulings. _As soon as reasonably practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants, in coordination with Parent, to prepare and
file with the Israeli Taxing Authority applications for the Israeli
Withholding Tax Ruling and the Israeli Options Tax Ruling. Each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall instruct their Representatives and advisors to,
cooperate with each other with respect to the preparation and filing of such
applications and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that
may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Withholding Tax
Ruling and the Israeli Options Tax Ruling. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to promptly take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable legal requirements to obtain
the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling and the Israeli Options Tax Ruling, as
promptly as practicable. The final text of the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling,
the Interim Withholding Ruling (as defined below), the Israeli Options Tax
Ruling and the Interim Options Ruling (as defined below) shall in all
circumstances be subject to the prior written confirmation of Parent or its
counsel,

 



      
 

 



 

which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. For this purpose,
failure to respond to any draft (or to proposed comments made by the Companys
counsel to any draft) of the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling, the Interim
Withholding Ruling, the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or the Interim Options
Ruling within three (3) business days in Israel of receipt shall be deemed to
be an approval of such draft (or comments proposed to such draft) by Parent
and its counsel. If the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling is not granted prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall seek to receive prior to the Acceptance
Time an interim withholding Tax ruling (the " **Interim Withholding Ruling**
") providing that (i) Parent and anyone acting on its behalf shall deposit
amounts specified in the Interim Withholding Ruling in an escrow account
approved by the Israeli Taxing Authority for the benefit of the Israeli Taxing
Authority until the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling is obtained and (ii)
Israeli withholding Tax shall not apply to the remaining consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that the Israeli Withholding Tax
Ruling or the Interim Withholding Ruling has not been received by the
Acceptance Time, Parent and anyone acting on its behalf shall be entitled, as
reasonably determined by Parent, to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under Applicable Law and shall timely pay such withholding amount to
the appropriate Taxing Authority. If the Israeli Options Tax Ruling is not
granted prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall seek to receive prior
to the Acceptance Time an interim Tax ruling confirming that Parent and anyone
acting on its behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding Tax in relation
to any payments made to the 102 Trustee (the " **Interim Options Ruling** ").
In the event that the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or the Interim Options Ruling
has not been received by the Acceptance Time, Parent and anyone acting on its
behalf shall be entitled, as reasonably determined by Parent, to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to the 102 Trustee pursuant
to Articles 2 and 3, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Law and shall
timely pay such withholding amount to the appropriate Taxing Authority. For
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts the payment of which has been delayed or
held in escrow pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not bear any interest.

 



 

Section 7.08 _. Tax Covenants._

 



 

(a) The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent a certificate in form
and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly completed and executed, dated as of
the Acceptance Time and prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), sufficient to
establish that an interest in Company does not constitute a United States real
property interest for purposes of Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

 



 

(b) _Government Grants_. The principle approval of the Investment Center by
the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Employment or the Israeli Taxing

 



       
 

 



 

Authority, if required under special ruling shall have been granted in
connection with the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8** 
COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

Parent agrees that:

 



 

Section 8.01 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. _Parent shall take all
actions necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.02 _. Voting of Shares. _Parent shall cause all Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares owned beneficially or of record by
it, Merger Subsidiary or any of its other Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof.

 



 

Section 8.03 _. Director and Officer Liability. _Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to do, and the Surviving Corporation shall do, the
following:

 



 

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (each, an " **Indemnified Person** ") in respect of
acts or omissions in their capacity as officers or directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or
provided under the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws in effect on the
date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. The Surviving
Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any claims, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 8.03(a) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the director or officer of the Company to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to the
Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.03(a).

 



 

(b) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors,

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and officers, as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, who are covered by
the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
actions or omissions of such officers and directors prior to the Effective
Time in their capacities as such (the " **D andO Insurance**") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies of
which have been previously made available to Parent) (" **Equivalent
Coverage** ") or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 8.03(c), the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of two hundred percent (the " **Maximum Amount** ") of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may, after prior consultation with Parent, purchase
six year "tail" prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time which policies
provide such directors and officers with Equivalent Coverage; _provided_ ,
that the amount paid by the Company shall not be in excess of the Maximum
Amount of the per annum premium rate paid by the Company as of the date hereof
for such policies. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 8.03(c) shall be deemed to have
been satisfied and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.03.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company Certificate, the
Company Bylaws or certificate of incorporation or bylaws of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or
under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

Section 8.04 _. Employee Matters. _(a) During the one-year period beginning
on the Closing Date, Parent shall provide (i) each individual who is

 



      
 

 



 

employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (each,
a " **Continuing Employee** ") compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing
(excluding the value of any severance benefits and excluding any rights to
receive equity compensation), (ii) each Continuing Employee who as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time holds the title of Vice President or
above six months of notice prior to terminating such employees employment
without cause; _provided_ that Parent may elect, in lieu of providing such
notice, to provide such employee with payment of such employees base salary
and cash incentive compensation for such six month period, and (iii) each
Continuing Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time holds a
title that is below Vice President and whose employment is terminated without
cause payment of two months of such employees base salary for each full or
partial year of such employees service with the Company, Parent and their
respective Affiliates; _provided_ that such payment shall not exceed 12 months
of such employees base salary.

 



 

(b) Parent shall provide credit for each Continuing Employees length of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual, other than benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, under each plan, program, policy or arrangement
of Parent and its Affiliates to the same extent that such service was
recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of Closing; _provided_ that, such prior service
credit shall not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication of
benefits.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each benefit
plan of Parent and its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee may
participate following the Closing that provides for medical, dental, health,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits (each, a " **Parent Welfare Plan** ") to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and service conditions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements, other than limitations
that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Closing under the corresponding Employee Plan, (ii) honor any
payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible, out-of-pocket
maximums and co-payments under an Employee Plan in satisfying any applicable
deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under the corresponding
Parent Welfare Plan during the same plan year in which such payments, charges
and expenses were made, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to
such Continuing Employee following the Closing to the extent that such
Continuing Employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the
corresponding Employee Plan.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Employee Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent
or any of its Affiliates, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from

 



      
 

 



 

amending any Employee Plan, (iii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates to
continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any period of time or
(iv) without limiting the last sentence of Section 12.06(a), confer any rights
or benefits on any Person other than the parties to this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.04 shall be construed to limit
any obligation of Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
Continuing Employees under Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 8.05 _. Financing. _(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate
and enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing
and Financing Commitments on terms and conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) contemplated by the Financing Commitments, so that such agreements
are in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof but in any
event no later than the Acceptance Time, (iii) cause their respective
Representatives to cooperate in the preparation of all documents (including
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and road show
presentations, if any) and the making of all filings in connection with the
Financing and the other transactions contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, and in executing and delivering all documents and instruments
related to the Financing Commitments, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the Financing
Commitments that are within its control and comply with its obligations
thereunder, (v) enforce their rights under the Financing Commitments in the
event of a breach by the Financing Sources that impedes or delays the
consummation of the Financing, including seeking specific performance of the
parties thereunder and (vi) otherwise taking, or causing to be taken, all
actions and doing, or causing to be done, all other things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Acceptance Time.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide to the Company copies of all final
documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the Company fully informed
of material developments in respect of the financing process relating thereto.
Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not agree to,
or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Financing
Commitments or other final documentation relating to the Financing in a manner
that (x) would materially delay or prevent the Closing in any respect or (y)
is otherwise adverse to the Company in any material respect, without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld in its sole
discretion).

 



 

(b) In the period between the date hereof and the Acceptance Time, upon
request of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in
connection with the Financing, including, (i) preparation of all required
financial statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
reasonable participation in meetings and road shows, if any, (iii) the
provision of information

 



      
 

 



 

relating to the Financing reasonably requested by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, (iv) reasonable assistance in the preparation of offering
memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and (v) after the Acceptance Time, facilitate the
perfection of the lenders security interest in the collateral contemplated by
the Financing; _provided that_ nothing herein shall require such cooperation
from any the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
in connection with such cooperation.

 



 

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and
Merger Subsidiary to satisfy its obligations under Section 8.05(a), any of the
Financing or the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement
relating thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Acceptance Time, in
whole or in part, for any reason, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall (i)
promptly notify the Company of such expiration or termination and the reasons
therefor and (ii) promptly arrange for alternative financing (the " **Required
Financing Alternative** ") from other sources to replace the financing
contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments or agreements, which
Required Financing Alternative (x) shall not include any conditions that are
more onerous than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the Financing
and (y) shall be in an amount sufficient to pay for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.05(a), at
any time Parent or Merger Subsidiary may replace the Financing with
alternative financing arrangements which (i) provide Parent and Merger
Subsidiary with sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement prior to or concurrent with the Acceptance Time and (ii) do
not prevent or materially impair or delay the Closing (together with the
Required Financing Alternative, the " **Financing Alternative** "). In the
event Parent or Merger Subsidiary replaces the Financing with any Financing
Alternative, the terms of Section 8.05(a) shall no longer apply with respect
to the Financing, but shall thereafter apply with respect to the Financing
Alternative.

Time, to the Offer to any Person; _provided_ that, such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under the
Offer, enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or
due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or prejudice the rights of tendering
stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

Section 12.07 _. Governing Law. _This Agreement shall be governed by and

provided by law. Without limiting the foregoing, each party irrevocably agrees
that service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be
deemed effective service of process on such party. Nothing in this Agreement

regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the 1934 Act,
pay for any Shares and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, may terminate
the Offer, if as of any then scheduled Expiration Date:

 



 

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration
Date that number of Shares that, together with the number of Shares (if any)
then owned of record by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, represents at least a
majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a Fully Diluted basis)
(the " **Minimum Condition** ");

 



 

(b) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement has not
expired or terminated prior to the termination or expiration of the Offer;

 



 

(c) any Other Required Governmental Approvals shall not have been obtained or
any waiting period (or extension thereof) or mandated filing shall not have
lapsed or been made either unconditionally or on terms reasonably satisfactory
to Parent; or

 



 

(d) there is any statute, rule, decree, regulation, judgment, order or
injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed
applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a
Government Authority to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the Agreement, or any other action shall be taken by any
Governmental Authority, other than the application to the Offer or the Merger
of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or similar waiting periods
with respect to the Other Required Governmental Approvals, which in any such
case restrains or prohibits the making or consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or the performance of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 



 

(e) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section
5.02 (Corporate Authorization), Section 5.05 (Capitalization) (other than the

Section 5.20 (Finders Fees), Section 5.21 (Opinion of Financial Advisor) and

date, in which case as of such date) and (ii) all other representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or
other writing delivered by the Company pursuant hereto (disregarding all
materiality and Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein other
than the qualifications contained in Sections 5.15(a) (first sentence)
(Intellectual Property), 5.17(a) (first sentence) (Employee Benefit Plans) and
5.19 (first sentence, in respect of the definition of "Material Contract")

of another specified time, which shall be true only as of such time), with
only such exceptions as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of clause (e)(i) above
solely with respect to the representation and warranty of the Company
contained in the second sentence of Section 5.05 (Capitalization), the parties
agree that such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all
material respects to the extent that the sum of the number of Shares and the
number of Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of Options and Warrants
(such sum, the " **Outstanding Capital** "), as certified pursuant to clause
(h) below, is no more than 0.5% greater than Outstanding Capital as of the
close of business on June 13, 2011);

 



 

(f) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or to comply, in all
material respects, any of its obligations under this Agreement prior to such
time and such breach or failure shall not have been cured on or prior to the
Acceptance Time;

(h) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
an executive officer of the Company dated as of the date on which the Offer
expires certifying that the Offer Conditions specified in paragraphs (e), (f)
and (g) do not exist; and

 



 

(i) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

The conditions contained in clauses (a) through (i) above: (x) are for the
benefit of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and may be asserted by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such
condition, (y) other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in
their sole discretion, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and (z) other than the Minimum
Condition, shall be deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived
(to the extent waiver is permitted by Applicable Law and the Merger
Agreement). The failure by Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such rights
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at
any time and from time to time.
