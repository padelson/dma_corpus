indemnity under this Agreement or (iii) pursuant to Clause 7, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law the payment shall be made by way of adjustment of
that portion of the Purchase Price allocated in Schedule 11 to the particular

relates under this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be
adjusted by the amount of such payment, provided that to the extent that such
an adjustment (i) is less than USD 500,000 (five hundred thousand US dollars)
or (ii) would result in the portion of the Purchase Price allocated in
Schedule 11 to the particular category of Business Asset being less than USD

 **10.8** ** ****Net financial benefit**

  



  

Neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement in respect of any claims
to the extent of any corresponding Tax savings by the other Party or any of
its Affiliates arising in respect of such Losses or the facts giving rise to
such Losses where the amount (if any) by which any Taxation for which the
other Party or such Partys Affiliate would otherwise have been accountable
or liable to be assessed is actually reduced or extinguished as a result of
the matter giving rise to such liability (after taking into account the
amount of any increased Taxes incurred by such Party as a result of the
accrual or receipt of any payments for such claims under this Agreement,
including any incurred Taxes resulting from compensating such Party for any
such increases).

  



  

 **10.9** ** ****Mitigation of Losses**

  



  

Each Party shall procure that all commercially reasonable steps are taken and
all commercially reasonable assistance is given to avoid or mitigate any
Losses which, in the absence of mitigation, might give rise to a liability in
respect of any claim under this Agreement, it being agreed that any liability
of a Party under this Agreement for Losses suffered or incurred by the other
Party shall include liability in respect of the reasonable costs and expenses
suffered or incurred by the other Party in taking such mitigation steps;
provided, however, that with respect to (a) Excluded Liabilities and any
Liabilities for which Seller is liable under an indemnity set out in this
Agreement, all such steps and all such assistance shall be at Sellers sole
cost and expense (including for all of Purchasers reasonable internal costs)

Purchasers sole cost and expense (including for all of Sellers reasonable
internal costs).

  



  

 **10.10** ******Right to recover**

  



  

 _10.10.1_ __ Neither Party shall be required to pay over any amounts
relating to any actual Liability unless and until such actual Liability is
due and payable, or any Losses relating to any contingent Liability unless
and until such contingent Liability becomes an actual Liability and is due
and payable, provided that this Clause 10.10.1 shall not operate to exclude
liability in relation to a claim made in respect of an actual or contingent
Liability within the relevant time limit specified in Clause 10.1 and
specifying the matters set out in Clause 11.2.

  



  

 _10.10.2_ __ Neither Party shall be liable in respect of any Losses claimed
under this Agreement to the extent that such Losses are covered by a right of
recovery against a third party and the relevant member of Purchasers Group
or Sellers Group, as applicable, fails to use commercially reasonable
efforts to make such recovery. If, before a Party pays an amount in discharge
of any claim under this Agreement, the other Party has recovered (directly or
indirectly, by payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise)
from a third party a sum which compensates such other Party (in whole or in
part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject matter of the claim, then
such payment obligations shall be commensurately reduced after taking into
account costs and expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining such recovery and
limited to the amount actually recovered in respect of the claim. If a Party
(the " **Payor Party** ") has paid an amount in discharge of any claim under
this Agreement and the other Party (the " **Payee Party** ")
subsequently recovers (directly or

indirectly, whether by payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or
otherwise) from a third party a sum which compensates the Payee Party (in
whole or in part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject matter of the
claim, then the Payee Party shall forthwith pay or procure to be paid to the
Payor Party the amount recovered, less any costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in obtaining such recovery and limited to the amount actually paid
by the Payor Party in respect of the claim.

  



  

 _10.10.3_ __ Double claims

  



  

Neither Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party under this
Agreement more than once in respect of the same Losses suffered. Subject to
any other limitations set out in this Agreement, in the event that any
matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any combination thereof) giving
rise to a breach of a Warranty is also the subject of an indemnity under this
Agreement, the claim for such breach of Warranty shall be limited to a claim
under said indemnity.

  



  

 **10.11** ******Tax indemnity and Tax warranty claims**

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement and except for
Clause 10.1 and Clause 10.8, this Clause 10 shall not apply with respect to
any claim under the Tax Warranties or the Tax Indemnity.

other member of Purchasers Group as is reasonably necessary to enable Seller
to assess the merits of the claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make
such provision as Seller may consider necessary, provided that Purchaser
shall continue to have the right to make any such claim after such 20
(twenty) Business Day period, except to the extent that Seller is actually
prejudiced by Purchasers failure to comply with the terms of this Clause

the claim and the evidence on which such Party relies and, if practicable, an

future event), provided that a deficiency within such notice shall not
preclude the Party providing such notice from, subject to any other
applicable limitations of liability, recovering from the other Party with
respect to such claim, except to the extent that the other Party is actually
prejudiced by such deficiency.

  



  

 **11.3** ** ****Commencement of proceedings**

  



  

Without detracting from Clause 11.1.1 or 11.1.2, any claim notified to Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, pursuant to Clause 11.1.1 or 11.1.2 shall (if it
has not been previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to be
irrevocably withdrawn 12 (twelve) months after the notice is given pursuant
to Clause 11.1.1 or 11.1.2, or, in the case of any contingent liability, 12
(twelve) months after such contingent liability becomes an actual liability
and is due and payable, unless legal proceedings in respect of it (i) have
been formally commenced and (ii) are being and continue to be pursued
with reasonable diligence.

be payable in respect of such claim; and

 **11.5** ** ****Procedure for third party claims**

  



  

If the claim set out in the notice delivered by the claiming Party (the "
**Claiming Party** ") to the other Party (the " **Other Party** ") pursuant
to Clause 11.1 is a result of or in connection with a claim by or liability
to a third party then:

  



  

 _11.5.1_ _ _no admissions in relation to such third party claim shall be

 _11.5.2_ _ _if such third party claim or liability is solely for money
damages or, where Seller is the Other Party, will have no continuing effect
in any material respect on the Group or the Operations, the Other Party shall
be entitled at its own expense by notice to the Claiming Party, and the
Claiming Party and its Affiliates shall duly and fully co-operate to allow
the Other Party, to assume the defence with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Claiming Party at its sole cost and expense and to take such action as it
deems reasonably necessary to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal,
compromise or contest such claim or liability (including making counterclaims
or other claims against third parties) in the name of and on behalf of the
Claiming Party or its Affiliates concerned, and to control the conduct of any
related proceedings, negotiations or appeals, provided that the Other Party
shall not settle or compromise any claim or demand without the consent of the
Claiming Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, it being agreed
that it shall be deemed reasonable for the Claiming Party to withhold its
consent for any settlement that includes anything other than a monetary
settlement and a complete release of the Claiming Party;

documents and records, in each case to the extent the Other Party
may reasonably request for the purpose referred to in Clause 11.5.2,
including instructing such professional or legal advisors as the Other Party
may nominate to act on behalf of the Claiming Party or its Affiliates
concerned, but in accordance with the Other Partys instructions, it being
agreed that the Other Party shall keep the Claiming Party informed of all
relevant matters relating to the claim and shall forward or procure to be
forwarded to the Claiming Party copies of all material external
correspondence (other than such correspondence as is subject to legal
professional privilege) relating to the claim, provided that the Claiming
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel, the reasonable costs
of which shall be for the Other Partys expense, and solely to control the
Claiming Partys defence of such asserted liability if in the reasonable
written opinion of counsel to the Claiming Party, a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Other Party and the Claiming Party that would
make such separate representation necessary under the applicable canons of
ethics, provided that in such event, the Claiming Party shall not settle
or compromise any claim or demand without the consent of the Other Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; and

  



  

 _11.5.4_ _ _until such time as the Other Party may issue a notice pursuant

Clause 11.5, the Claiming Party shall procure that (a) it and its relevant

Party when taking any action to avoid, dispute, deny, defend, resist, appeal,
or contest the claim or liability (including in respect of the making of
counterclaims or other claims against third parties), and (b) the Claiming

otherwise, whether or not such person would thereby commit a breach of his
contract of service, provided that the placing of an advertisement of a post
available to a member of the public generally and the recruitment of a person
through an employment agency shall not constitute "seeking to hire" for
purposes of this Clause 12, provided that no member of Sellers Group
instructs or encourages such agency to approach any such person.

  



  

 _12.1.2_ _ _The restrictions in Clause 12.1.1(a) shall not operate to

opportunity to participate in the process with respect to the sale of that
portion of such acquired business engaged in such Restricted Activity and

five thousand US dollars), and with whom Purchaser has had contact in the
course of the Transaction, provided that the placing of an advertisement of a

person through an employment agency shall not constitute "seeking to hire"
for purposes of this Clause 12.2, provided that no member of Purchasers
Group instructs or encourages such agency to approach any such person. The
restriction in this Clause 12.2 shall not operate to prohibit any member of
Purchasers Group from exercising any right or fulfilling any obligation

Agreement.

  



  

 **12.3** ** ****Specific performance**

  



  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage is likely to occur if any of the

judicial body, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or
threatened breach of Clauses 12.1 or 12.2, without the requirement of posting

but in any event within 5 (five) Business Days of being so requested by
Seller, make to each such Remaining Transfer Employee an offer in writing to
employ him or her under a new contract of employment to take effect
immediately; and

  



  

 _(ii)_ _ _shall procure that the offer to be made will be such that (A) the
provisions of the new contract shall be, subject to Paragraph 3(c), for at

respect of VAT to any relevant Tax Authority) to secure that the sale of the

state and to charge (or not to charge) VAT to the relevant Business
Purchaser(s) in accordance with that ruling. Seller (and relevant other
member(s) of Sellers Group) shall not be obliged to challenge that ruling.

(c) In the event that in order to secure that the sale of a Business so far
as carried on in the EU is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply
of services for the purposes of the Law governing VAT in the relevant member
state, it is necessary for the relevant Business Purchaser to make an
election for the purposes of VAT in respect of such Business or any asset
comprised in the sale of such Business then the relevant Business Purchaser
shall only be obliged to make any such election:

  



  

 _(i)_ _ _to the extent that it is entitled so to do; and

  



  

 _(ii)_ _ _provided that Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers Group)
notifies Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) in writing

to the last date upon which such election can be made under the applicable
Law governing VAT in the relevant member state.

  



  

 **5** ** ****VAT: Going Concern - non-EU Jurisdictions**

  



  

(a) Subject to Paragraph 4, to the extent that any state outside the European
Union provides for relief or exemption from VAT on the transfer of a business
in a company or treats such a transaction as being non-taxable for VAT
purposes, Sellers Group shall and Purchasers Group shall use all reasonable
efforts (including, for the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Paragraph
3(c), the making of an election and/or application in respect of VAT to any
relevant Tax Authority) to secure such treatment as regards the sale of a
Business so far as carried on in the relevant state under this Agreement. To
the extent that the intention as to the use of the assets acquired as set out
in this sentence is a condition as to the availability of a relief or
exemption from VAT in respect of the sale of a business or for such
transaction to be treated as being non-taxable for VAT purposes as described
above in this Paragraph 3(a), Purchaser agrees that the relevant Business
Purchaser intends to use the assets acquired in carrying on the same kind of
business, whether or not as part of its existing business, as the relevant
Business Seller.

  



  

(b) Seller shall have the right to obtain (or to procure that the relevant
other member of Sellers Group obtains) a ruling from the relevant Tax
Authority as to whether the sale of a Business so far as carried on in the
relevant state is eligible for a relief or exemption or is otherwise non-
taxable for the purposes of the Law governing VAT in that state and to charge
(or not to charge) VAT to the relevant Business Purchaser in accordance with
that ruling. Seller (and relevant other member(s) of Sellers Group) shall
not be obliged to challenge that ruling. If Purchaser (or relevant other
member(s) of Purchasers Group) wishes to challenge any ruling, it may do so
at its own cost, but any such challenge shall not affect the date on which
VAT must be paid to the relevant Business Seller under Paragraph 5.

as carried on in a non-EU member state is treated as being non-taxable for
VAT purposes, it is necessary for the relevant Business Purchaser in respect
of such Business or any

Law governing VAT in the relevant non-EU member state.

  



  

 **6** ** ****VAT: election**

  



  

If:

  



  

(a) a sale, transfer or supply of one or more assets in accordance with
Paragraphs 4(a) or 5(a) would result in a VAT disadvantage for Seller (or the
relevant other member of Sellers Group), including a repayment or recharge
of input VAT credited or deducted; and

  



  

(b) Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers Group) can make an election
as to whether or not the sale, transfer or supply of such asset is subject to
VAT; and

  



  

(c) Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) would be
entitled to recover (by way of credit or repayment) the full amount of VAT
charged to Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) in
respect of such sale, transfer or supply; and

  



  

(d) Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) would not
otherwise suffer any Tax disadvantage as a result of such VAT charge and/or
the making of any elections as described in this Paragraph 4,

  



  

then:

  



  

(e) Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers Group) shall subject to
prior written approval of Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld (provided that it shall be reasonable for Purchaser so to withhold
its approval unless Purchaser, acting reasonably, considers both that (x)
both of the conditions set out in paragraph 4(c) and (d) above will be
satisfied and (y) it (or other relevant member of Purchasers Group) will be
entitled to and can make the election described at paragraph 4(f) below prior
to the expiry of the time period for the making of such election), be
entitled to elect for the sale, transfer or supply of the asset to be subject
to VAT; and

  



  

(f) subject to the making of such election as is described in Paragraph 4(e)
above by Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers Group), Purchaser (or
relevant other member of Purchasers Group) shall, to the extent that it is
entitled to do so, make any election that may be necessary in order to give
effect to the election made by Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers
Group), provided that Seller (or relevant

other member of Sellers Group) notifies Purchaser (or relevant other member
of Purchasers Group) in writing no later than 10 (ten) Business Days prior
to the last date upon which such election can be made under the applicable
Law governing VAT.

  



  

 **7** ** ****VAT: time, manner and currency of payment**

  



  

(a) In the event that it is determined by a relevant Tax Authority (whether
or not in response to an application for a ruling, by assessment or
otherwise) or by a court of competent jurisdiction, that VAT is properly
chargeable in respect of the sale of a Business or the Shares under this
Agreement, Purchaser shall procure that any amounts of VAT which Purchaser
(or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) is obliged to pay to Seller
(or relevant other member of Sellers Group) in terms of this Schedule 12,
shall be paid to Seller (or relevant other member(s) of Sellers Group) or as
Seller may direct in accordance with Paragraph 5(b) or 5(c) (as the case may
be) below. Such amounts shall be paid in the currency in which the VAT in
question must be accounted for to the relevant Tax Authority.

  



  

(b) Subject to Paragraph 5(c) below, any VAT payable in any jurisdiction in
respect of the transfer of any of the Businesses or the Shares shall be paid
by Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group) at the later of
(i) Closing or (ii) ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of notification
from Seller that VAT is so properly chargeable pursuant to a determination as
described in Paragraph 5(a) above in respect of the relevant sale provided
that Seller has first delivered to Purchaser (x) a valid VAT invoice or
equivalent document which is necessary to enable Purchaser (or relevant other
member of Purchasers Group) to recover or obtain credit for such VAT, and
(y) a copy of the relevant determination as described in Paragraph 5(a)
above, in each case in respect of the relevant sale.

  



  

In the event that Seller (or relevant other member of Sellers Group) had
previously delivered to Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers
Group) an invoice without VAT in relation to the transfer of the Shares or
relevant Business, Seller shall, or shall procure that the relevant other
member of Sellers Group shall, issue a credit invoice to Purchaser (or
relevant other member of Purchasers Group).

  



  

(c) Neither Purchaser nor relevant other member of Purchasers Group shall be
obliged to pay any VAT arising pursuant to Paragraph 4 above unless and until
it has recovered an amount equal to such VAT (whether by way of repayment,
credit or otherwise) from the relevant Tax Authority.

  



  

In the event that Purchaser (or relevant other member of Purchasers Group)
has paid an amount of VAT pursuant to this Paragraph 5 to Seller (or relevant
other member of Sellers Group) and it is subsequently determined by the
relevant Tax Authority or court of competent jurisdiction that all or part of
such VAT was not properly chargeable then, if so requested by Purchaser,
Seller shall, or shall procure that the relevant other member of Sellers
Group shall, use all reasonable

of VAT so recovered and interest thereon. Seller shall or shall procure that
the relevant other member of Sellers Group shall deliver to Purchaser (or
relevant other member of Purchasers Group) a credit invoice.

filed in a manner consistent with applicable Law and, subject thereto, past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made

The Purchaser shall, at its own expense, within 60 days after Closing

 **Execution version**

  



  



  

failure of the notifying Party to comply with this provision shall not affect
such Partys right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent such
failure impairs the other Partys ability to contest any such Tax Liability.
The notice shall set out such information as is available and as is
reasonably necessary to enable such other Party to assess the merits of the
claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make such provision as such other
Party may consider necessary.

  



  

 **16.2** ** **If the Seller so requests in writing, ultimately within 20
(twenty) Business Days of receiving notice of or giving notice to the
Purchaser in accordance with Paragraph 9.1, the Seller shall have the right

conduct of any audits or other proceedings if and to the extent that these

Effective Time; and

(including legal and advisor fees) reasonably incurred by any member of
Purchasers Group to facilitate Sellers conduct of such audit or proceeding;

  



  

 _(ii)_ _ _Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted, at
Purchasers expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or
proceeding.

  



  

 _(iii)_ _ _Seller shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively
or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could
adversely affect a liability for Taxes of any member of Purchasers Group to
any extent, unless Seller has indemnified each such member of Purchasers
Group against the effects of any such settlement (including the imposition of
Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the
lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of
amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit
carryforwards), without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent
may be withheld in the sole discretion of Purchaser;

  



  

 _(iv)_ _ _If Seller is not able or permitted to, or otherwise does not,
control any such audit or proceeding, Purchaser may do so (and in doing so
Purchaser shall not waive any right against Seller under this Agreement) and
Seller shall pay, and indemnify Purchaser against, reasonable costs and
expenses (including legal and advisor fees) incurred by Purchaser in doing
so.  Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Purchaser any obligation

in Paragraph 9.2, shall be entitled to settle and compromise any such audit
or proceeding and shall have no liability to Seller relating to any such
audit or proceeding, settlement or compromise (including relating to any
decision not to conduct any such proceeding). To the extent that any such
audits or other proceedings relate to a period that starts prior to, and ends
after, the Effective Time or for which Seller would be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to Paragraph 9.2:

  



  

 _(i)_ _ _Purchaser shall advise the Seller periodically of developments in
the audit investigation or other proceedings and obtain the Sellers prior
written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) on critical decisions and on material written communications to
be forwarded to any Tax Authority or competent court in relation to the audit
or other proceedings if and to the extent they regard Taxes attributable to
the period prior to the Effective Time; and

  



  

 _(ii)_ _ _Seller and its representatives shall be permitted, at Sellers
expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.

  



  

 **16.4** ** **Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other such
information and render such assistance as may reasonably be requested in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defence of any audit or other
proceeding including audits or other proceedings of Seller or Purchaser Tax

 **17** ** ****Fiscal Unity**

  



  

 **17.1** ** **Parties acknowledge that the Group Companies shall be
separated from the CIT Fiscal Unity and VAT Fiscal Unity ultimately as from
the Effective Time or as from an earlier date to be agreed upon between the
Parties. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with (i) an opening balance sheet for Dutch
corporate income tax purposes of the relevant Group Companies as at the
Effective Time and (ii) explanatory notes thereto.

  



  

 **17.2** ** **If for Tax purposes a revaluation of the assets and/or the
liabilities of a Group Company is required, pursuant to the application of
article 15ai of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de
vennootschapsbelasting 1969) at the level of the CIT Fiscal Unity, and Seller
or the member of the Sellers Group is liable to Tax resulting from such
revaluation, then Purchaser will compensate Seller for any additional Taxes
actually paid as a consequence of such revaluation to the extent and in an
amount that the Group Company actually (i) receives a refund or reduction of
Tax or (ii) benefits from a reduction in Tax payable resulting from such
revaluation.

  



  

 **17.3** ** **The amount mentioned in Paragraph 10.2 will be computed and
paid for in the year during which a final assessment for the relevant year
has been imposed on the relevant Group Company and such assessment has not
been appealed. Purchaser may at any time set off the amount of compensation
determined in accordance with this Paragraph 10.3 against

any claims, which it may have against Seller under this Agreement.

  



  

 **17.4** ** **If, notwithstanding Paragraph 10.1, any Group Company is not
separated on or before the Effective Time from a VAT Fiscal Unity then, in
respect of the period from the day immediately after the Effective Time to
the date of such ultimate separation (the "Post-Closing Period"):

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall or shall procure that the relevant Group Company shall
pay to Seller or relevant member of Sellers Group as Seller may direct an
amount (if any) equal to the excess of (i) the amount of output VAT (in
respect of any supply, acquisition or importation) attributable to the
activities of the relevant Group Company in respect of the Post-Closing
Period which output VAT has been received by the relevant Group Company over
(ii) any deductible input VAT attributable to the activities of the relevant
Group Company in respect of the Post-Closing Period; and

  



  

(b) Seller shall or shall procure that the relevant member of Sellers Group
shall pay to Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchasers Group as
Purchaser may direct an amount (if any) equal to the excess of (i) any
deductible input VAT attributable to the activities of the relevant Group
Company in respect of the Post-Closing Period over (ii) output VAT (in
respect of any supply, acquisition or importation) attributable to the
activities of the relevant Group Company in respect of the Post-Closing
Period which output VAT has been received by the relevant Group Company.

  



  

The Seller and the Purchaser agree to use all reasonable efforts to separate
any relevant Group Company from the relevant VAT Fiscal Unity as soon as
possible following the Effective Time so that the length of any Post-Closing
Period shall be minimised.

  



  

 **17.5** ** **The Seller and the Group Companies shall jointly file a
request to allocate loss carry forwards of the CIT Fiscal Unity to the extent
any such loss carry forward was reflected as an asset in the relevant Working
Capital Statement or as a reduction to a liability in the relevant Working
Capital Statement or Net Debt Statement, to the extent possible, to the
relevant Group Companies in accordance with article 15af of the Dutch
Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969).

Party under this Tax Indemnity more than once in respect of the same Losses
suffered in respect of an Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that any matter, act, omission or circumstance
(or any combination thereof) giving rise to a breach of a Tax Warranty is
also the subject of an indemnity under this Tax Indemnity, the claim for such
breach of Tax Warranty shall be limited to a claim under this Tax Indemnity.
