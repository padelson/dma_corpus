jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;5.01 </B><U><I>Corporate Organization</I></U>. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the
failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority and
governmental approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, prohibit or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their
respective obligations under this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;5.02 </B><U><I>Authority Relative to This Agreement</I></U>. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation
by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents
as required by the OGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable
against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of the
Equitable Exceptions.

warranty of the Company that is qualified in scope as to materiality (including a Material Adverse
Effect) shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualifications. There shall be no right
of contribution for any Securityholder from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any

Options, an amount of the Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration that is greater than
the amount of Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration received or to be received by
such Securityholder under the terms of the Merger Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, as a

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party (including, for this purpose, any Securityholder). Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
<U>provided</U> that the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party (including, for this purpose, any Securityholder), the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any party hereto, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their
rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Parent (which in the case of Merger Sub is a
corporation incorporated under Chapter&nbsp;1701 of the OGCL), <U>provided</U> that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform
such obligations.

hereof (without posting bond therefor), in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. Each of

remedy at law would be adequate and (ii)&nbsp;any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond
in connection with obtaining any such equitable relief.
