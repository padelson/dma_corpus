to, the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the combination of

and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any

split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent

(e) _Merger Sub Limited Liability Company Interests_. At and after
the Effective Time, each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an
outstanding limited liability company interest of Merger Sub and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Election and Proration Procedures_. (a) An election
form (the " _Election Form_ "), which shall contain a release of claims in
the form of _Section 4.21_ hereto and agreement of the Company
Stockholders to comply with the obligations set forth in this Agreement
applicable to Company Stockholders as if they were a direct party
hereto (which agreement to comply shall be substantially in the form of
_Exhibit E_ hereto), shall be mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by the
Parties that is not more than forty-five (45) nor less than thirty (30) days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as the Parties
shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record
of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").

  



  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder to specify (x) the
number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder makes a Mixed Election (each such share, a " _Mixed Election
Share_ "), (y) the number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election (each such share, a "
_Cash Election Share_ "), and (z) the number of shares of such holder's
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Stock Election
(each such share, a " _Stock Election Share_ "). Any Company Shares with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly
completed Election Form (including duly executed transmittal
materials included with the Election Form), accompanied by any Company
Certificates to which such Election Form relates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the twenty-fifth (25th)
day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Parties
shall agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_ ," and the holders of
such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with
respect to such No Election Shares. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
prepare and deliver a notice to each Company Stockholder reasonably
satisfactory to each of Parent and the Company announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and
at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline. Not later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Effective Time as
is reasonably practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect
the following prorations to the Merger Consideration:

  



    

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash
Election Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall, instead of
being converted into the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the
right to receive (in addition to the Escrow Consideration and the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) (A) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election Consideration,
_multiplied by_  a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available
Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "), and (B) a number of
shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the Stock Election Consideration _multiplied by_ a
fraction equal to one (1) _minus_  the Cash Fraction.

  



  

(ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash
Election Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall, instead of
being converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration,
be converted into the right to receive (in addition to the Escrow
Consideration and the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) (A) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount by which the Available
Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount _divided by_ the number
of Stock Election Shares, and (B) a number of shares of validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the Stock
Election Consideration _multiplied by_  a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election Consideration _minus_
(II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this paragraph, and the
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Consideration.

  



  

(c) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form (including duly executed transmittal materials included with the
Election Form), accompanied by any Company Certificates to which such
Election Form relates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), by the Election
Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the authorized
Person properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election
Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No Election
Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made with
respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock prior to the
Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether
any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good
faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding
and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company, or the Exchange Agent shall be
under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

Section 2.3 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Company
Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
pursuant to an Exchange Agent Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall also act as
the agent for the Company's stockholders for the purpose of receiving and
holding their Election Forms and Company Certificates and shall obtain no
rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Parent Common Stock portion
of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration and
the Escrow Stock Consideration) and (ii) cash in immediately available funds
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration (less the Escrow Cash Consideration and the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Amount), Fractional Share Consideration and any
dividends under _Section 2.3(h)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case,
for the sole benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate cash
portion of the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Cash Consideration and
the Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount), Fractional Share

(c) _Deposit of Stockholders ' Representative Expense Amount_. At
or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, with
the Stockholders' Representative, into an account specified by the

number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Aggregate Stockholders '
Representative Expense Amount_") which will be used for the purposes of paying
directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Representative for, any third
party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto. The Company Stockholders will not receive any interest or earnings on
the Aggregate Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Stockholders' Representative any ownership right
that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Stockholders' Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Aggregate Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will

purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion
of the Stockholders' Representative's responsibilities, the Stockholders'
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Aggregate
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Company Stockholders. For tax purposes, the Aggregate
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Stockholders at the time of
Closing.

reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the

provided to a holder of Dissenting Shares by Section 13.02 of the MBCA (it
being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with

, _however_ , that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed
Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without
interest or duplication, the Mixed Election Consideration, the Escrow

consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts

holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates, and such fractional share

reasonably likely to (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii)
materially impede or delay receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approval. To

that would cause any Requisite Regulatory Approval not to be received in a
timely manner.

  



    

 | -28-|

(u) _Real and Personal Property_. The Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company (a) has good and marketable title to all the real property, if
any, reflected in the latest audited balance sheet included in the Company
Financial Statements as being owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company or acquired after the date thereof (except properties sold or
otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice) (the " _Company Owned Properties_
"), free and clear of all Liens, except (i) Liens for current Taxes and
assessments not yet past due or the amount or validity of which is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) Liens for real
property Taxes not yet past due, (iii) easements, rights of way, and other
similar encumbrances, (iii) mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's,
warehousemen's and carrier's Liens and any statutory Liens arising in the
ordinary course of business of the Company consistent with past practice, or
(iv) such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not
materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject
thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations
at such properties (clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, " _Permitted
Liens_ "), and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the
latest audited balance sheet included in the Company Financial Statements or
acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that have expired by their
terms since the date thereof) (collectively with the Company Owned Properties,
the " _Company Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Liens of any nature
whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and is in possession of the
properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid
without Default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
the lessor. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending or
threatened condemnation proceedings against any Company Real Property. The
Company has previously made available to Parent a true and complete list of
all Company Real Property as of the date of this Agreement and a true and
complete copy of all leases pursuant to which the Company or a
Subsidiary leases real property, together with all amendments thereto.

  



  

(v) _Administration of Trust Accounts_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have properly administered all common trust funds and
collective investment funds and all accounts for which each of them acts as a
fiduciary or agent, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves
as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator
or investment advisor, in accordance in all material respects with the terms
of the governing documents and applicable Law, and, to the Company's
Knowledge, no events have occurred with respect to any such funds or accounts
that would reasonably be expected to result in any liability to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective directors, officers or employees acting on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust
or fiduciary duty, with respect to any such common trust fund or collective
investment fund or fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each
such common trust fund or collective investment fund or fiduciary or agency
account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect
the assets of such common trust fund or collective investment fund or
fiduciary or agency account. The Company and any Subsidiary that has
investment management authority or control over or otherwise has the power to
acquire, manage or dispose of any assets of a fund or account subject to
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code meets the definition of a
"qualified professional asset manager" set forth in Section VI(a) of
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14, as amended (the "
_QPAM Exemption_ ") and is not disqualified from relying on the QPAM
Exemption for transactions entered into on behalf of any fund or account
which is, or whose assets are, subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code due to the application of Section I(g) of the QPAM Exemption. Each
collective investment fund that is intended to be exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code and qualify as a "group trust" under Revenue
Ruling 81-100 (as modified by Revenue Ruling 2004-67, as modified by Revenue
Ruling 2011-1, and as modified by Revenue Ruling 2014-24) has a current
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and there
are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause such
determination letter to be revoked.

advisory fees, investment bankers' fees, brokerage fees, commissions or
finders' fees in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. A true and complete copy of the engagement letter

therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Company Stockholders and a signed copy of such opinion has been delivered
to Parent. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

(y) _Transactions with Insiders and Affiliates_. Other than
customer Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and on an
arms-length basis, there are no agreements, Contracts, plans, arrangements or
other transactions between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any (1) officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (2) record or beneficial owner of voting securities of the
Company or (3) related interest or family member of any such officer, director
or record or beneficial owner, in any case other than employment and related

shares of Parent Common Stock so issued to the Company Stockholders will
be "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act. To the Knowledge of the Company, each of the Company
Stockholders is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D,
Rule 501(a), promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company has

Subsidiary of the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
director or officer of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company,
beneficially owns or, within the past two (2) years has beneficially owned,
in the aggregate three percent (3%) or more of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock.

Proposal (including an unredacted copy of all proposed agreements and other
documents with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) or any amendment or
modification thereof) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board
of Directors of the Company takes into account in good faith any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to fail to take
such action. During the four (4) Business Day notice period referred to in
clause (i) above, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks
to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this _Section 4.5(a)_ and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this _Section 4.5(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to convene the Company
Stockholder Meeting within twenty (20) days following the date of this
Agreement. Except with the prior approval of Parent, no other matters shall
be submitted for the approval of the Company's stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, other than a proposal for the Company Stockholder
Approval and a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall keep Parent updated with
respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting as reasonably requested by Parent.

(b) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to use all
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the Company stockholders in
favor of the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholder Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of this
Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Registration Rights_. (a) In connection with this
Agreement, at the Closing, Parent and the Company Stockholders shall enter
into a Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit F _(the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "). Parent shall
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review the Registration
Statement referred to in the Registration Rights Agreement and all related
documents and shall duly consider any comments thereon provided by the
Company or its advisors. Parent shall cause the Registration Statement to be
filed with the SEC prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date of
the Registration Statement referred to in the Registration Rights Agreement,
the Company shall, on behalf of Parent, notify each Company Stockholder of
the information Parent advises the Company that it requires from each such
Company Stockholder if such Company Stockholder elects to have any of its
Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement)
included in the Registration Statement. Parent's obligations to file the
Registration Statement and cause it to be effective, with respect to each
Company Stockholder, are conditioned on the receipt of such information, and
to the extent any Company Stockholder has failed to provide Parent with such
information, Parent's obligations with respect to such Company Stockholder
(but not with respect to any other Company Stockholder) will be suspended (but
not otherwise diminished) until such requested information has been provided
to Parent.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Listing of Parent Common Stock_. Parent shall cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 4.8 _Selling Restrictions_. (a) The Company Stockholders
agree, severally and not jointly, that, from the Closing Date until the close
of trading on the one hundredth (100th) trading day following the Closing Date
(the " _Transfer Restriction Period_ "), they shall not, on any given trading
day, Transfer a number of shares of Parent Common Stock acquired pursuant to
this Agreement that in the aggregate exceeds the Daily Limit. During the
Transfer Restriction Period, each Company Stockholder (together with its
Affiliates) shall be permitted to Transfer on any given trading day a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock acquired pursuant to this Agreement
up to (and in no event in excess of) such Company Stockholder's Transfer
Restriction Pro Rata Portion of the Daily Limit. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, one or more of the Company Stockholders may
agree to engage, in consultation with, and on terms reasonably acceptable to,
Parent, a broker-dealer, investment adviser or other intermediary to
coordinate the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock by such Company
Stockholders during all or any portion of the Trading Restriction Period, in
which case the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock by a Company Stockholder
participating in such arrangement may exceed such Company Stockholder's
Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portion on a given trading day but only if the
aggregate sales on such trading day by all participating Company Stockholders
do not exceed the aggregate Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portions of all
such participants. The Company Stockholders that engage in such
coordinated activity shall cause (i) prior written notice to be given to
Parent and Parent's transfer agent, identifying such intermediary and the
participating Company Stockholders and (ii) such intermediary to provide to
Parent on each trading day a statement of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock sold on that trading day for each participating Company
Stockholder. Nothing in this  _Section 4.8(a)_ shall prohibit one or more of
the following Transfers by a Company Stockholder: (i) a Transfer to
an Affiliate of the Company Stockholder; (ii) a Transfer by will or by
operation of law, in which case this _Section 4.8(a)_  shall bind the
transferee; (iii) a Transfer in connection with estate or charitable planning
purposes, including any Transfer to relatives, trusts and charitable
organizations; and (iv) such other Transfers as Parent may otherwise agree in
writing in its sole discretion; provided that as a condition to each
permitted Transfer under (i)-(iii) above, each transferee shall deliver a
written instrument to Parent, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
agreeing to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this _Section 4.8_.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 4.8_ , the following terms shall
be defined as follows:

  



  

(i) " _Daily Limit_ " shall mean a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to (x) 0.10, _multiplied_ _by_ (y) the average daily trading
volume of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE for the twenty (20) trading day
period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as
reported by the NYSE.

  



  

(ii) " _Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portion_ " shall mean, with
respect to each Company Stockholder, the quotient obtained by _dividing_  (x)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock acquired by such Company
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement (inclusive of such Company
Stockholder's Pro Rata Portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited
with the Escrow Agent) _by_ (y) the total number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued to all Company Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement (inclusive
of the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Escrow Agent).

  



  

(c) In addition to any other restrictions provided herein, no
Company Stockholder shall Transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock
acquired pursuant to this Agreement unless the Transfer is either (i)
pursuant to an effective registration statement and/or prospectus under the
Securities Act, and is in compliance with any applicable state securities or
"Blue Sky" Laws and applicable requirements of the NYSE or (ii) pursuant to
an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and, if reasonably
requested by Parent, such Company Stockholder shall furnish Parent with an
opinion of counsel, which opinion of counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, to the effect that no such registration is required because of the
availability of such exemption.

  



    

 | -46-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) In the event of any purported or attempted Transfer by a Company
Stockholder that does not comply with the provisions of this _Section
4.8_, such attempted Transfer shall be null and void _ab initio_ and will
confer no rights whatsoever on the purported transferee as against Parent,
and Parent shall not record such Transfer on its books or treat any purported
transferee of such Parent Common Stock as the owner of such Parent Common
Stock for any purpose.

  



  

Section 4.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including  _Section 4.10_, the Parties
(other than the Stockholders' Representative) will use all reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with and furnish
information to the other Party to that end, and obtain all consents of, and
give all notices to and make all filings with, all Governmental Authorities
and other third parties that may be or become necessary for the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
agree to make any payments or modifications to agreements in connection
therewith without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and _provided_ ___further_
_,_ that nothing contained herein shall preclude any Party from
exercising its rights under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Each Party (other than the Stockholders' Representative)
undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to
qualify, and to take no action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying,
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(c) The Parties (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall
consult with respect to the character, amount and timing of
restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall take such charges in
accordance with GAAP, as such Parties shall mutually agree upon.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Applications and Consents_. (a) The Parties (other
than the Stockholders' Representative) shall cooperate with each other and
use, and cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Permits, Consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and including making, or committing to make,
such changes to the composition of the Board of Directors of Global Trust
Company as are required to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated
by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the State of Maine), and to comply
with the terms and conditions of all such Permits, Consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Authorities and third parties.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, prepare and file any applications, notices and
filings required to be filed with any Governmental Authority in order to
obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, _provided_ that the Parties (other
than the Stockholders' Representative) shall complete all filings required by
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_ ") within ten (10) days following the date of this Agreement.

  



    

 | -47-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other
on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties (other than the
Stockholders' Representative) agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all Permits, Consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each Party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
the Company shall give Parent and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.

  



  

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the
Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose Consent is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes
such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
Consent will be materially delayed.

  



    

 | -48-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations, Consents, Orders or
approvals from, to or with (i) the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the FDIC,
the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (including under the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act) and the Bureau of Financial
Institutions of the State of Maine that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and (ii)
any other Governmental Authority that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, except in
the case of this clause (ii) for any such authorizations, Consents, Orders or
approvals the failure of which to be obtained or made would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or its Subsidiaries to take, or
agree to take, any actions, or to accept any restriction, requirement or
condition, that, individually or in the aggregate, would (i) reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or the Company, (ii)
prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Parent or Merger
Sub of all or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (iii) compel Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of
the business or assets of Parent or Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a
whole (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

  



  

Section 4.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party (other
than the Stockholders' Representative) will give prompt written notice to the
other (and subsequently keep such other Party informed on a current basis)
upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event,
change, circumstance or effect that (a) is reasonably likely to result in any
Material Adverse Effect on it, or (b) would cause or constitute a breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained
herein; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ or  _5.2(b)_ , or
_Section 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by such Party due to its
failure to give such notice unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ , or _Section 5.3(a)_ or _5.3(b)_ , as the case may be,
or give rise to a termination right under _Section 6.1_; _provided_ _further_
, that no such notification or other disclosure after the date of this
Agreement shall operate as a cure of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained herein and such
notification or such other disclosure shall not be given any effect for
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties
contained herein or determining whether any Person has a right to
indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof.

Section 4.12 _Investigation and Confidentiality_. (a) Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other Representatives of Parent, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all of their properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel,
information technology systems and records, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
such information concerning their respective businesses, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the Company's regular
business operations during any such access. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure, in the Company's good faith
judgment, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company (after giving due consideration to the existence of
any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties)
or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. No investigation by Parent shall affect the
representations and warranties of the Company or the right of Parent to rely
thereon or Parent's right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_
hereof.

  



  

(b) Each Party (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall,
and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to,
maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it
by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses,
operations and financial positions to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Press Releases; Publicity_. Prior to the Effective
Time, each Party shall consult with and obtain the approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the other as to the form and
substance of any press release, other public statement (including employer
communications) or stockholder communication related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby prior to issuing such press release,
public statement or stockholder communication or making any other public or
stockholder disclosure related thereto; _provided,_ that nothing in this
_Section 4.13 _shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any
disclosure that it deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such
Party's disclosure obligations imposed by Law or the NYSE. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in good faith in preparing a joint press release
announcing this Agreement, which press release shall be issued concurrently by
Parent and the Company not later than one (1) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement.

Section 4.14 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that it
will not, and will cause its directors, officers, employees and
Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) continue, engage or participate in any negotiations
concerning, (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any Person (other than
Persons who are Affiliates or Representatives of the Company or Parent)
relating to, or (iv) approve, recommend, agree to or accept, any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _that_ , prior to, but not after, the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company receives an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that was not
received in violation of clauses (i) - (iv) above, and the Company's Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may,
and may permit its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data to and
participate in such negotiations or discussions with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure
to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ _further_ , that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
shall provide to Parent any such information not previously provided to
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may (without any determination
by the Board of Directors of the Company or consultation with outside counsel
or its financial advisor) (x) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained that was not received in
violation of clauses (i) - (iv) above, contact such third party solely in
order to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and/or
(y) provide any Person who makes an Acquisition Proposal or who expresses
interest to the Company in making an Acquisition Proposal a copy of this
Agreement. The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable Law, to, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof,
request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information
provided to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives) pursuant to any existing confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating
to an Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within twenty four
(24) hours of receipt, advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or
any of its directors, employees, officers or Representatives receives (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information, discussion or
negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer that is
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together
with the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry,
proposal or offer, and shall furnish Parent with a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, with a
description of the material terms and conditions thereof). The Company shall
keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects on a
timely basis of the status and details (including, within twenty four (24)
hours after the occurrence of any amendment, modification,
development, discussion or negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any
written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and summaries of
any material oral inquiries or discussions.

  



  

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall, (i) except as expressly permitted by _Section 4.5(a)_ , (A)
withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of
the Company or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend, endorse or otherwise
declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, (C)
resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions or (D) submit this
Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (each such action set
forth in this clause (i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) (A) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other Contract constituting or relating to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section 4.14(a)_
) or (B) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

  



    

 | -51-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The Company agrees that any breach by its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates or Representatives of this _Section 4.14_ shall be
deemed a breach by the Company.

  



  

Section 4.15 _Takeover Laws_. None of the Company, Parent or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Law
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each Party (other than
the Stockholders' Representative) and the members of their respective Boards
of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Law.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Employee Matters_. (a) During the twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time, for the current employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain compensation and benefits (including
base salary, annual cash incentive opportunities, vacation opportunity, and
health and welfare benefits, but excluding retirement benefits) which are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable to those in effect for the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) honor
all employment agreements set forth on _Section 4.16_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms, including with respect to
amendment with such Continuing Employees. The Continuing Employees shall be
given, subject to applicable Law, credit for past service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities to the extent credited by the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) for purposes of
determining eligibility for and vesting of employee benefits (but not for
pension benefit accrual purposes) under all welfare and retirement programs
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employees
participate following the Effective Time and for purposes of determining
length of vacation, sick time, paid time off and severance under
Parent's applicable plan or policy, except if any such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, under the welfare plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees participate, Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
their commercially reasonable efforts, to (i) waive, or cause to be waived,
for each participating Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations to the same
extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company
or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by each participating
Continuing Employee and their eligible dependents in the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

  



    

 | -52-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee
shall be terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries without cause within
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, such Continuing Employee shall be
entitled (subject to meeting applicable eligibility and vesting requirements)
to receive severance benefits no less than those provided under the terms of
Parent's severance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to take, all reasonable actions that may be
requested by Parent in writing with respect to (i) causing one or more
Company Benefit Plans to terminate as of or following the date immediately
preceding the Effective Time or for benefit accruals and entitlements to cease
as of or following the date immediately preceding the Effective Time, (ii)
causing the continuation on and after the Effective Time of any Contract,
arrangement or insurance policy relating to any Company Benefit Plan for such
period as may be requested by Parent, or (iii) cooperating with Parent to
facilitate the merger of any Company Benefit Plan into any Benefit Plan of
Parent or its Subsidiaries as of or following the Effective Time. All
resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with the implementation of this _Section 4.16(c)_ shall be
subject to Parent's reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d) In the event of any termination of any Company Benefit Plan
providing employer-provided health coverage or consolidation of any such plan
with any Benefit Plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries providing employer-
provided health coverage within twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
(i) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to
Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-provided health coverage
that, together with all other compensation and benefits provided, complies
with  _Section 4.16(a)_ and (ii) former employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and their qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage under group health plans of Parent to the extent required
by COBRA. During the twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, unless a
Continuing Employee causes coverage to terminate under a Company Benefit Plan

subject, however, to the following four (4) sentences. If the Company elects
to exercise its termination right pursuant to this _Section 6.1(h)_ , it shall
give prompt written notice thereof to Parent, but in any event not later than
the end of the five (5) Business Day period referred to above. During the
five (5) Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
Parent shall have the option of increasing the Stock Election Consideration
to equal the lesser of (A) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-
thousandth), the numerator of which is equal to the product of the Stock
Election Consideration (as then in effect) and the Index Ratio, and the
denominator of which is equal to the Parent Ratio, or (B) a quotient (rounded
to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of which is equal to the
product of the Stock Election Consideration (as then in effect), the Initial
Parent Market Value and 0.85, and the denominator of which is the Parent
Market Value. If the Stock Election Consideration is so increased, the Mixed
Stock Consideration shall be automatically increased to equal the amount
obtained by multiplying the increased Stock Election Consideration
determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence by 0.50. If within
such five (5) Business Day period, Parent delivers written notice to the
Company that it intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the two preceding sentences, then no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this _Section 6.1(h)_ , and this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
(except that the Stock Election Consideration and the Mixed Stock
Consideration shall have been so modified).

indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders under _Section
7.2(a) _or the Parent Cap when referring to the indemnification obligations
of Parent under _Section 7.3(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing (including

the Company Stockholders with respect to (i) Excluded Taxes (as set forth in
_Section 8.4_), (ii) any and all breaches of the Specified
Representations, (iii) any Willful Misconduct of a Party (including any
employee of such Party), any Affiliate of such Party or any Company

subject to the Cap, but (other than Excluded Taxes (as set forth in _Section
8.4(b)_) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.6_.

  



  

(b) No indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the
Parent Indemnitees or the Company Indemnitees under _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(a)_, respectively, for breaches of representations and
warranties unless the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be
payable under _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ , respectively, exceed an amount
equal to $840,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon the Parent Indemnitees or
the Company Indemnitees, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive
amounts for Losses in excess of the Deductible, and subject to _Section
7.4(a)_, up to the Cap; _provided_ , that the indemnification obligations
with respect to Excluded Taxes, any and all breaches of the Specified
Representations, any and all breaches of covenants or agreements and any
Willful Misconduct (including in respect of breaches of representations
and warranties), shall not be subject to the Deductible, but instead shall be
recoverable from "dollar one".

  



  

(c) For purposes of this _Article VII_, in determining the amount
of any Losses in respect of the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty, any qualification or limitation as to materiality (whether by
reference to material, Material Adverse Effect or otherwise) contained in
such representation or warranty shall be disregarded, other than such
qualification contained in _Section 3.2(d)(ii)_ ( _Reports; Financial
Statements_ ), _Section 3.2(e)(C)_ ( _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_
) or _Section 3.3(h)(B)_ ( _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_ ), which

(d) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified hereunder for
lost profits or any consequential, punitive or exemplary damages (except any
such damages paid or payable to a third party, or, with respect to lost
profits or consequential damages, to the extent such damages would have been
reasonably foreseeable, as of the date of this Agreement, to any of the
individuals listed in _Section 9.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter).

  



  

(e) The amount of (i) any net Tax benefit, (determined on a with and
without basis and net of any Tax cost) actually realized by the Indemnitee or
its Affiliates attributable to such Losses or (ii) insurance proceeds or other
recoveries actually received by any Indemnitee or its Affiliates in respect
of such Losses, less the related reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by such Indemnitee in recovering such amount, shall reduce the
Losses that such Indemnitee may recover under this _Article VII_. If
any Indemnitee receives any net amounts under the first sentence of this
_Section 7.4(e)_ subsequent to an indemnification payment by an indemnifying
party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") in respect of such Losses, then such Indemnitee
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or expense
incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the net amounts so received by such Indemnitee.
In computing the amount of any Tax benefit pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 7.4(e)_, the Indemnitee or its Affiliates shall be deemed to
recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before
recognizing any item arising from the incurrence or payment of such Losses.

  



  

(f) No Indemnitee may recover duplicative Losses in respect of a
single set of facts or circumstances under more than one representation or
warranty in this Agreement regardless of whether such facts or circumstances
would give rise to a breach of more than one representation or warranty in
this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
except as limited by _Section 7.6(d)_, (i) none of the limitations on
the indemnification obligations of the Parties (including the Cap or any
Deductible) shall apply to claims based on Willful Misconduct and (ii) the
representations, warranties and covenants of any Indemnitor, and an
Indemnitee's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Indemnitee (including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of
the fact that the Indemnitee or any of its Representatives knew or should have
known, whether before or after the date hereof, that any such representation
or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
this clause (ii) shall not apply with respect to any fact or circumstance
about which, in the case of the Parent Indemnitees, any individual identified
in _Section 9.1_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, or in the case of the
Company Indemnitees, any individual identified in _Section 9.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, had actual knowledge before the date hereof.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Indemnification Claim Process_. (a) All claims for
indemnification by either a Company Indemnitee or a Parent Indemnitee under
this _Article VII_ shall be asserted and resolved in accordance with
_Sections 7.5 _and _7.6._

  



    

 | -68-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If a Parent Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant
to this _Article VII_, including with respect to any direct or Third Party
Claim, the Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Stockholders'
Representative and, if any portion of the Escrow Amount remains in the Escrow
Fund, the Escrow Agent, in writing of such claim, describing such claim in
reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of any Losses expected
to arise out of such claim (the " _Claims Notice_ ");  _provided_ that,
subject to the consequences of not delivering a Claims Notice prior to the
Cut-off Date as set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, the failure of a Parent
Indemnitee to promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative shall not
relieve the Company Stockholders from liability for such claims except and
only to the extent that the Company Stockholders were actually prejudiced by
such delay.

  



  

(c) If a Company Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant
to this _Article VII_, including with respect to any direct or Third Party
Claim, the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly deliver a Claims Notice
to Parent; _provided_  that, subject to the consequences of not delivering a
Claims Notice prior to the Cut-off Date as set forth in _Section
7.1(b)_, the failure of the Stockholders' Representative to promptly notify
Parent shall not relieve Parent from liability for such claims except and
only to the extent that Parent was actually prejudiced by such delay.

  



  

(d) Excluding Tax Claims, which are governed by _Section 8.5_, if
any claim, action, suit or proceeding is made or commenced against an
Indemnitee by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitor will
be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and except as provided
herein, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof in accordance with the
terms set forth herein with counsel selected by the Indemnitor that is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. The Indemnitor shall have thirty
(30) calendar days from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Claims
Notice to notify the Indemnitee in writing that the Indemnitor desires to
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting
therefrom. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, (i) the Indemnitee shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at
its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor and
(ii) the Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnitee advised of the status of such
Third Party Claim and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and
shall consider in good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnitee with
respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume control of a Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee shall
have the right to control such Third Party Claim at the Indemnitor's expense
(and the Indemnitor may participate in, but not control the defense of, such
Third Party Claim through counsel of its choosing at the Indemnitor's
expense): (i) to the extent that such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnitee; (ii) if the Indemnitee has
been advised by counsel that (A) there are one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to it with a reasonable prospect of success
which are not available to the Indemnitor or (B) there exists a reasonable
likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor; (iii) if the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, indictment, allegation or investigation of the
Indemnitee; (iv) if the Third Party Claim relates to regulation of the
Company or its business by a Governmental Authority or has been brought by
the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the FDIC or the Bureau of Financial
Institutions of the State of Maine or (v) if the Indemnitor elected to
control the defense of such Third Party Claim and then failed to conduct such
defense in an active and diligent manner or withdrew from the Third Party
Claim. The Indemnitor shall only be liable for the fees and expenses of one
counsel and, if necessary, one local counsel, employed by the Indemnitee for
any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof.

  



    

 | -69-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) If the Indemnitor has elected to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_, the Indemnitor may not
consent to entry of a judgment, pay, settle or compromise a Third Party Claim
without the written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the Indemnitee, unless such settlement:
(A) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim without any payment required to be made by
the Indemnitee; (B) does not subject the Indemnitee to any criminal liability
or injunctive relief or other equitable remedy; and (C) does not include a
statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf
of any Indemnitee.

  



  

(f) If the Indemnitee assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitee may not consent to entry of a judgment, pay, settle
or compromise a Third Party Claim without the written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the
Indemnitor.

  



  

(g) Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.5(d)_ and _Section
7.5(f)_, if the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt of the Claims Notice,
the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such defense, at the Indemnitor's
sole cost and expense upon delivery of written notice to such effect to the
Indemnitor at any time after such forty-five (45) calendar day period.

  



  

(h) The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall, and shall each cause
its controlled Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to the
other party in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial
activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in
respect of which an Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_, including, but not limited to, by providing the other party
with reasonable access to books, records, employees and officers (including as
witnesses) of such party and its Affiliates including, without limitation,
with respect to information that may have been subject to an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Indemnification Recovery_. (a) The indemnification
obligations of the Company Stockholders under  _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be
recoverable from the Escrow Fund (subject to any applicable Deductible). If,
and only to the extent that the Escrow Fund has been exhausted due to the
satisfaction of any indemnifiable Losses under _Section 8.4_ and this
_Article VII_ and/or the release of the Escrow Fund to the Exchange Agent

not jointly, based on each such Consenting Company Stockholder's
Indemnification Pro Rata Portion (with each Consenting Company Stockholder
being responsible for its Indemnification Pro Rata Portion of such Loss), for
any Losses actually suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnitee solely to
the extent arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Specified Representation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section
7.6(d)_, the maximum aggregate liability of the Consenting Company
Stockholders in respect of any indemnification obligations under this
Agreement (except obligations governed by _Section 8.4_) shall be
the proceeds actually received by the Consenting Company Stockholders, and
the maximum aggregate liability of any individual Consenting Company
Stockholder shall be the proceeds actually received by such Consenting Company
Stockholder.

(b) In the event of a breach by a Company Stockholder of any
covenant to be performed by such Company Stockholder following the Closing, a
Parent Indemnitee may, at its election (except as otherwise set forth in
_Section 8.4_ with respect to Tax matters), recover any Losses arising out
of or resulting from such breach pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ from either or

Affiliate of the Company of any covenant to be performed prior to the
Closing, a Parent Indemnitee may, at its election, recover any Losses arising
out of or resulting from such breach pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ from (i)
first, the Escrow Fund and (ii) second, as a condition to and in consideration
for Parent's payment of the Merger Consideration (as acknowledged by the
Consenting Company Stockholders in their respective Stockholder Support

sentence), shall indemnify and hold harmless each Parent Indemnitee for any
Losses actually suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnitee arising out of
or resulting from any Willful Misconduct of the Company (including any
employee of the Company), any Affiliate of the Company or any Company
Stockholder that occurs prior to the Closing. A Parent Indemnitee may recover
any Losses arising out of or resulting from such Willful Misconduct from
either or both of (i) the Escrow Fund and (ii) as a condition to and in
consideration for Parent's payment of the Merger Consideration
(as acknowledged by the Consenting Company Stockholders in their respective
Stockholder Support Agreements and Joinders) and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Consenting Company Stockholders
directly, severally and not jointly, based on each such Consenting Company
Stockholder's Indemnification Pro Rata Portion (with each Consenting Company
Stockholder being responsible for its Indemnification Pro Rata Portion of
such Loss); _provided_ , that any Parent Indemnitee suffering or incurring
Losses as a result of the Willful Misconduct of a Company Stockholder or an
employee or Affiliate thereof (such Company Stockholder, an " _At-Fault
Company Stockholder_ ") shall, before seeking indemnification directly from
the other Consenting Company Stockholders, seek indemnification for such
Losses first from the At-Fault Company Stockholder (without limitation to its
Indemnification Pro Rata Portion of such Losses), and, if and to the extent
that such Parent Indemnitee is unable, after exercising commercially
reasonable efforts, to recover the full amount of such Losses from the At-
Fault Company Stockholder, from the other Consenting Company Stockholders,
severally and not jointly, based on each such Consenting Company
Stockholder's Indemnification Pro Rata Portion of any such unrecovered
Losses; _provided_ , _further_ , that the maximum aggregate liability of the
Consenting Company Stockholders in respect of any indemnification obligations
under this Agreement (except obligations governed by _Section 8.4_) shall be
the proceeds actually received by the Consenting Company Stockholders and the
maximum aggregate liability of any individual Consenting Company Stockholder
shall be the proceeds actually received by such Consenting Company
Stockholder, except that the maximum aggregate liability of any At-Fault
Company Stockholder (and, accordingly, the maximum aggregate liability of the
Consenting Company Stockholders as a whole) shall be increased by the Losses
for which the At-Fault Company Stockholder provides indemnification under
this _Section 7.6(d)_.

(e) For a period of forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of a
Claims Notice in compliance with _Section 7.5(a)_, the Escrow Agent shall
make no payment unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Stockholders' Representative to make such payment.
After the expiration of such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute to Parent or a designee of Parent, out of the Escrow
Fund, an amount equal to all or a portion of the Losses set forth in such
Claims Notice to the extent the Stockholders' Representative has not objected
in a written statement to the applicable portion of any claim or claims made
in the Claims Notice, which written statement shall include in reasonable
detail the basis for such objection, and such written statement shall have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of
such forty-five (45)-calendar day period. Any such payments out of the Escrow
Fund shall be in the form of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in a
ratio of cash to shares of Parent Common Stock equal to fifty percent (50%)
cash and fifty percent (50%) shares (with the shares of Parent Common Stock
being valued at the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock, as
recorded on the NYSE, during the twenty (20) trading day period ending on the
trading day immediately preceding the date on which such distribution is made
by the Escrow Agent); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there shall remain in
the Escrow Fund an insufficient amount of either cash or shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary for the Escrow Agent to make the distribution in the
ratio set forth above, the ratio of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to
be distributed by the Escrow Agent shall be equitably adjusted as necessary to
pay the full amount of the relevant Losses (subject to the exhaustion of the
entire Escrow Fund). If the Stockholders' Representative objects in writing
to any portion of the claim or claims by a Parent Indemnitee made in any
Claims Notice within the forty-five (45)-calendar day period described above,
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith for
forty-five (45)-calendar days after Parent's receipt of such written
objection to resolve such objection. If the Parent Indemnitee and the
Stockholders' Representative shall so agree, a written notice setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties and delivered to
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
any such notice and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of
such notice. If no such agreement can be reached during the forty-five
(45)-calendar day period for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon
the expiration of such forty-five (45)-calendar day period, either Parent, any
Parent Indemnitee or the Stockholders' Representative may bring suit in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.8_ in respect of such claim. The
final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction (a "
_Final Order_ ") as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claims
Notice shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to act in accordance with the Final Order and the Escrow
Agent shall distribute cash and shares of Parent Common Stock from the
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
court may be entered in any other court having jurisdiction over the
applicable party.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Distribution of Escrow Fund_. Upon the Escrow
Termination Date, any amount remaining in the Escrow Fund shall promptly be
delivered to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company Stockholders,
subject to applicable withholding Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Escrow Fund shall not terminate with respect to any amount subject to any
unresolved claims for indemnifiable Losses for which any claims for
indemnification properly were made prior to the Cut-Off Date on or prior to
the Escrow Termination Date and in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article VII_, and no such amounts shall be distributed to the Exchange
Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity until the final resolution of such
claims has been determined. As soon as any such claim has been resolved, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion(s) of the Escrow Fund not
reasonably necessary to satisfy any remaining unresolved claims to the
Exchange Agent, subject to applicable withholding Taxes, for distribution to
the Company Stockholders. Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to its
Pro Rata Portion of any amount distributed from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
this _Section 7.7_ and the Escrow Agreement, with each cash amount rounded to
the nearest whole cent ($0.01) and each amount of Parent Common Stock rounded
to the nearest share of Parent Common Stock. Any amounts to remain in the
Escrow Fund to satisfy unresolved claims shall be in the form of cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock in a ratio of cash to shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to fifty percent (50%) cash and fifty percent (50%) shares (with
the shares of Parent Common Stock being valued at the volume weighted average
price of Parent Common Stock, as recorded on the NYSE, during the twenty (20)
trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date on
which the relevant distribution is made by the Escrow Agent); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if there shall remain in the Escrow Fund an insufficient
amount of either cash or shares of Parent Common Stock necessary for the
Escrow Agent to retain the amounts necessary to satisfy any unresolved
claims, the ratio of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock to remain in the
Escrow Fund shall be equitably adjusted as necessary to pay the full amount
of the relevant Losses (subject to the exhaustion of the entire Escrow Fund).

Section 7.8 _Stockholders ' Representative_. (a)
By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger,
each Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have approved the designation of,
and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each Company Stockholder for
all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto, in each case following the Closing, including to give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Parent Indemnitee from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Parent Indemnitee, to object
to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrations with respect to, any other
claim by any Parent Indemnitee against any Company Stockholder or by any such
Company Stockholder against any Parent Indemnitee or any dispute between any
Parent Indemnitee and any such Company Stockholder, in each case relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all
other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
(ii) permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the agreements ancillary
hereto. If the Stockholders' Representative shall resign or be removed by the
Company Stockholders, the Company Stockholders shall (by consent of those
Persons holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time), within ten (10) days
after such resignation or removal, appoint a successor to the Stockholders'
Representative. Any such successor shall succeed the former
Stockholders' Representative as the Stockholders' Representative hereunder.

  



  

(b) The Stockholders' Representative will incur no liability of any
kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Stockholders' Representative in connection with its services pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Stockholders' Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Stockholders will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Stockholders' Representative from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or
in connection with the Stockholders' Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholders' Representative, the Stockholders' Representative will reimburse
the Company Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to
the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Stockholders' Representative by the Company
Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Stockholders' Representative from (i) the Aggregate
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount and (ii) the amount of cash in
the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Company Stockholders; _provided_ , that while this
section allows the Stockholders' Representative to be paid from the Aggregate
Stockholders' Representative Expense Amount and the cash portion of the Escrow
Fund, this does not relieve the Company Stockholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders'
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company
Stockholders or otherwise. Any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnity of the Company Stockholders set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to
the Stockholders' Representative in this paragraph. The foregoing indemnities
will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholders'
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

Section 7.9 _Mitigation_. Nothing herein shall relieve any
Indemnified Party of its common law duty to mitigate Losses.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. In the event that the Closing shall
occur, except (i) as otherwise specifically set forth in _Section 8.4_ with
respect to Taxes or (ii) for a Party's right to specific performance as
set forth in _Section 9.14_, the Parties agree that the sole and exclusive
recourse for any and all claims or causes of action arising pursuant to this
Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, claims arising out of or
resulting from any Willful Misconduct, shall be the express indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_.

  



  

Section 7.11 _Approval by Company Stockholders_. By virtue of the
approval of this Agreement, and where applicable, the execution and delivery
of a Stockholder Support Agreement and Joinder by a Company Stockholder, such
Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have agreed to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including _Article II_, _Section 4.5_, 
_Section 4.8_, _Section 4.20_ (to the extent applicable), _Section 4.21_,
this _Article VII_,  _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ as such terms apply
to such Company Stockholder as if such Company Stockholder were a direct
party to this Agreement.

  



  

Article VIII 
  
 Tax Matters

  



  

Section 8.1 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company Stockholders, based on
their respective Pro Rata Portions, and the Parent will each pay fifty
percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes. The Company Stockholders and Parent shall
cooperate to timely prepare any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such
Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
imposition of any Transfer Taxes. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
Parent will file all Tax Returns or other filings with respect to Transfer
Taxes, and the Company Stockholders shall pay to Parent (based on their

Section 8.2 _Tax Returns_. (a) Parent shall prepare all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(other than any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes governed by Section
8.1) due after the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable
extensions) for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
(the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") and all Closing Date Tax Returns. All Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for
any Straddle Period shall be filed on the basis that the relevant taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date
Tax Returns_ "), unless the relevant Taxing Authority will not accept a
Closing Date Tax Return. Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative a draft of each Pre-Closing Tax Return and Closing Date Tax
Return at least forty (40) days before the due date of such Tax Return, and
Parent will make any revisions with respect to such Tax Return reasonably
requested by the Stockholders' Representative in writing at least ten (10)
days before the due date of such Tax Return, _provided_ that such revisions do
not materially adversely affect the Tax position of Parent, the Surviving
Entity or their Subsidiaries for any taxable period after the Closing. In the
event of a dispute, the matter shall be referred to a mutually agreed upon
nationally recognized firm (the " _Accounting Referee_ "), whose
determination shall be binding on both Parties. The costs of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne by the party that loses the dispute. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries shall, timely file with the relevant Taxing Authority
all Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Closing Date Tax Returns. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries shall, timely prepare and file all Straddle Period Tax
Returns that are not Closing Date Tax Returns with the relevant Taxing
Authority, _provided_ that Parent will deliver to the Stockholders'
Representative a draft of each such Straddle Period Tax Return including a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which the Company Stockholders
are responsible determined in accordance with _Section 8.3_ at least forty-
five (45) days before the due date, as such due date has been extended, for
such Tax Return that is an income Tax Return and as soon as practicable in
the case of any other such Tax Return. Parent will make any revisions with
respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return reasonably requested by the
Stockholders' Representative in writing at least ten (10) days before the due
date of such Tax Return, _provided_ that such revisions do not materially
adversely affect the Tax position of Parent, the Surviving Entity or their
Subsidiaries for any taxable period after the Closing. In the event of a
dispute, the matter shall be referred to the Accounting Referee, whose
determination shall be binding on both Parties. The costs of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne by the party that loses the dispute. Except to the
extent inconsistent with applicable Tax laws, all Pre-Closing Tax Returns,
Closing Date Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with past practice.

Date Tax Return or Straddle Period Tax Return (taking into account any
applicable extensions), the Company Stockholders will pay Parent, based on
their respective Pro Rata Portions (first from the Escrow Fund, to the extent
available) an amount equal to the Taxes of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries shown on such Pre-Closing Tax Return and Closing Date Tax Return
and an amount equal to the portion of the Taxes of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shown on such
Straddle Period Tax Return as determined in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

  



    

 | -76-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 8.3 _Straddle Period Taxes_. In any case where the
relevant Taxing Authority will not accept a Closing Date Tax Return with
respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period for any Straddle Period as follows: (i) in the case
of any Property Taxes, Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
equal the Property Taxes for such Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if the Straddle Period ended as
of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for
depreciation) shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Tax Indemnification_. (a) The Company Stockholders
hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnitees from and
against any Losses relating to: (i) Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company

including the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as
determined in _Section 8.3_; (ii) Taxes payable by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any
predecessor or successor thereof or any corresponding or similar provision
under state, local or foreign Law) as a result of membership in an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group on or before the
Closing Date; (iii) Taxes relating to the failure of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto with respect to Taxes to be true, correct and complete in all respects
or the failure of the Company Stockholders to perform any covenant contained
in this Agreement relating to Taxes; (iv) Transfer Taxes as determined in
_Section 8.1_; and (v) legal and accounting fees and expenses attributable
to any item in the foregoing clauses (together, the " _Excluded Taxes_ ");
_provided_ that the Company Stockholders shall be liable only to the extent
that such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes
(other than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) on the face of the balance sheet of
the Company included in the Unaudited Financial Statements (rather than in
any notes thereto), and that the Company Stockholders' indemnification
obligations for Losses relating to Excluded Taxes shall be recovered (i)
first, from the Escrow Fund, and (ii) second, as a condition to and in
consideration for Parent's payment of the Merger Consideration (as
acknowledged by the Consenting Company Stockholders in their respective
Stockholder Support Agreements and Joinders) and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from the Consenting
Company Stockholders directly, severally and not jointly, in accordance with
each such Consenting Company Stockholder's Indemnification Pro Rata Portion
(with each Consenting Company Stockholder being solely responsible for its
Indemnification Pro Rata Portion of such Loss). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement (including this _Section 8.4_ or _Article
VII_), (i) the Company Stockholders shall have no liability under this
Agreement (including via the Escrow Agreement) with respect to (and Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid) Taxes incurred as a result of actions outside
the ordinary course taken on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not
contemplated by this Agreement or are taken without the consent of the Company
Stockholders (or Stockholders' Representative), and (ii) the limitations set
forth in _Section 7.6_ shall not apply to the indemnification obligations
with respect to Excluded Taxes (as set forth in this _Section 8.4_ ).

  



    

 | -77-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any indemnification amount required to be paid in respect of
Losses relating to Excluded Taxes shall be paid within ten (10) calendar days
after the Parent Indemnitees make written demand upon the Company
Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company Stockholders' indemnification obligations for Losses relating to
Excluded Taxes (including all representations and warranties with respect to
Taxes) shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitations (taking into account all extensions
thereof), and shall be further limited as explicitly set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 7.6_ ).

  



  

(c) Any refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, overpayments
of estimated Taxes) of, or credits against, Taxes of, or with respect to, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries actually realized with respect to Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including the portion of any Straddle Period
allocated to Pre-Closing Tax Periods) will be for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders (net of any Tax liability arising as a result of the receipt or
realization of such refund or credit), excluding any refunds or credits that
are reflected on the face of the most recent balance sheet of the Company
(rather than in any notes thereto). The Parent or the Company will forward
the amount of any such refunds (whether received as a refund or as a credit
against or an offset of Taxes otherwise payable), together with any interest
thereon, as directed to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the
Company Stockholders within 10 days of receipt. All other refunds of, or
credits against, Taxes of, or with respect to, the Company (or the Surviving
Entity) or any of its Subsidiaries will be for the benefit of Parent.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Tax Claims_. If a claim is made by any Governmental
Authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity claim against
the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 8.4_ (" _Tax Claim_ "), Parent
shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Representative of such Tax Claim,
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to provide any such notice shall not
relieve any of the Company Stockholders of their indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent that any such Company Stockholder was actually
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall describe the asserted Tax Claim
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notices or other
documents received from any Taxing Authority in respect of any such asserted
Tax Claims. The Stockholders' Representative shall have the right to control
all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) Parent shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense of any such Tax Claim and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Stockholders' Representative, and
(ii) the Stockholders' Representative may not settle any such Tax Claim
without the written consent of Parent (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

Section 8.6 _Tax Cooperation and Elections_. Parent and the
Company Stockholders (and the Stockholders' Representative) agree to furnish
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as any of them
reasonably may request in connection with any Tax matters relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, which may include (but is not limited to)
information necessary for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns and
other Tax filings, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and
the defense of any claim or proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company Stockholders (or the Stockholders'
Representative) shall retain all records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or
the Company Stockholders (or the Stockholders' Representative), any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

allocation, sharing, indemnity or other similar agreement between the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Company Stockholder or its
Affiliate (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, will be terminated as of the Closing Date, and, after the Closing, none
of the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, any Company Stockholder or any of
their Affiliates will have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, unless (and then only to the
extent) otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 8.9 _Conflict_. To the extent that there is any conflict
between this _Article VIII_ and any other provision in this Agreement, this

(c) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include
the plural, and any plural term the singular. Whenever the words
"include," "includes," or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereby,"
"herein," "hereof" or "hereunder," and similar terms are to be deemed to
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, each of the Parties shall bear and pay all direct costs and expenses
incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder, whether or not such transactions are consummated,
including filing, registration, and application fees, printing fees, and fees
and expenses of its own financial or other consultants, investment bankers,
accountants, and counsel, except that Parent and the Company each shall pay
50% of all filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any additional
Antitrust Laws.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Parent Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits) constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder
and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect
thereto, written or oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall remain in effect. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit
of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance herewith without notice or
Liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, no
consent, approval, or agreement of any third party beneficiary will be
required to amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement. Except
for the obligation of the Company Stockholders to indemnify the Stockholders'
Representative in _Section 7.8(b)_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties or
their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_  that,
notwithstanding the foregoing clause, following the Effective Time only (but
not unless and until the Effective Time occurs), (i) the provisions of
_Section 4.18_ shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party described
therein, (ii) the provisions of _Article VII_ shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees described therein and (iii) each holder of Company Common Stock,
who properly surrenders his, her or its Company Common Stock in accordance
with _Article II_, shall have the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration (subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement) and such right shall be enforceable by such holder of Company
Common Stock.

Section 9.4 _Amendments_. Before the Effective Time, this
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits) may be
amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of the Parties, whether before
or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, except to the
extent that any such amendment would require the approval of the Company
Stockholders, unless such required approval is obtained. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any amendment to this Agreement requires the approval of the
Company Stockholders, the Parties may not so amend this Agreement with
respect to any particular Company Stockholder without the approval of such
Company Stockholder unless such amendment applies to all Company Stockholders
in the same fashion.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Waivers_. (a) Prior to or at the Effective Time,
either Party shall have the right to waive any Default in the performance of
any term of this Agreement by the other Party, to waive or extend the time
for the compliance or fulfillment by the other Party of any and all of such
other Party's obligations under this Agreement, and to waive any or all of
the conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, except any
condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law.
No waiver by a Party shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly
authorized officer of such Party.

  



  

(b) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right
of such Party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of
this Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term
contained in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a
waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Assignment_. Except as expressly contemplated hereby,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Notices_. All notices or other communications which
are required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if
delivered by hand, by facsimile or electronic transmission, by email, by
registered or certified mail, postage pre-paid, or by courier or
overnight carrier, to the Persons at the addresses set forth below (or at

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement and
all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles that would result in the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law,
exclusive jurisdiction over such matters is vested in the Federal courts, any
Federal court located in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Court of Chancery or,
to the extent required by Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, (A) any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such court, (B) any claim that such Party and such
Party's property is immune from any legal process issued by any such court
and (C) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.7_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange
of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or electronic
transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes. Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile or
electronic transmission shall be deemed to be their original signatures for
all purposes.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Captions_. The captions contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Interpretations_. Neither this Agreement nor any
uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or resolved against any
Party, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. No Party to this
Agreement shall be considered the draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that this Agreement has been reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all
Parties and their attorneys and shall be construed and interpreted according
to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of the Parties.

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of
such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it
has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect
and in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree
upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original
intent of the Parties. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to
be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING, LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED
ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN)
OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH
THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
PRESENT AS A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED
ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1_, the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity.
