rise to its determination to take such action, including the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third
party in any such Acquisition Proposal (including an unredacted copy of all proposed agreements and other documents with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal) or any amendment or modification thereof) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company takes into account in good faith any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in
good faith that it would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to fail to take such action.
During the four (4) Business Day notice period referred to in clause (i) above, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this <U>Section&nbsp;4.5(a)</U> and will require a new notice
period as referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.5(a)</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to convene the Company Stockholder Meeting within twenty (20) days following the date of this Agreement. Except with
the prior approval of Parent, no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting, other than a proposal for the Company Stockholder Approval and a proposal to adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the Company Stockholder
Meeting as reasonably requested by Parent.</P>

&ldquo;<U>Transfer Restriction Period</U>&rdquo;), they shall not, on any given trading day, Transfer a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock acquired pursuant to this Agreement that in the aggregate exceeds the Daily Limit. During the Transfer Restriction

of shares of Parent Common Stock acquired pursuant to this Agreement up to (and in no event in excess of) such Company Stockholder&rsquo;s
Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portion of the Daily Limit. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, one or more of the
Company Stockholders may agree to engage, in consultation with, and on terms reasonably acceptable to, Parent, a broker-dealer,
investment adviser or other intermediary to coordinate the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock by such Company Stockholders
during all or any portion of the Trading Restriction Period, in which case the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock by a Company
Stockholder participating in such arrangement may exceed such Company Stockholder&rsquo;s Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portion
on a given trading day but only if the aggregate sales on such trading day by all participating Company Stockholders do not exceed
the aggregate Transfer Restriction Pro Rata Portions of all such participants. The Company Stockholders that engage in such coordinated
activity shall cause (i) prior written notice to be given to Parent and Parent&rsquo;s transfer agent, identifying such intermediary
and the participating Company Stockholders and (ii) such intermediary to provide to Parent on each trading day a statement of
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sold on that trading day for each participating Company Stockholder. Nothing in this
<U>Section&nbsp;4.8(a)</U> shall prohibit one or more of the following Transfers by a Company Stockholder: (i) a Transfer to an
Affiliate of the Company Stockholder; (ii) a Transfer by will or by operation of law, in which case this <U>Section 4.8(a)</U>
shall bind the transferee; (iii) a Transfer in connection with estate or charitable planning purposes, including any Transfer
to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations; and (iv) such other Transfers as Parent may otherwise agree in writing in its
sole discretion; provided that as a condition to each permitted Transfer under (i)-(iii) above, each transferee shall deliver
a written instrument to Parent, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, agreeing to be bound by the restrictions set forth
in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.8</U>.</P>
