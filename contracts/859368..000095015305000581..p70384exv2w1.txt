iii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of March 20, 2005 (this "AGREEMENT"), by and among Medicis
Pharmaceutical Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Masterpiece
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Inamed Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders to consummate, the merger of the
Company with and into the Merger Sub (the "MERGER") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL");   WHEREAS, for federal
income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and that this
Agreement shall be, and hereby is, adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code; and   WHEREAS, certain capitalized
terms used herein are defined in Section 8.03;   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION").   Section 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"CLOSING") shall take place on the second Business Day after the satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article
VI (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent provided by
Law and this Agreement, waiver of those conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual date of the Closing
being referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE"). The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 650 Town Center Drive, 20th Floor, Costa
Mesa, California 92626, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of
merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") executed in accordance    with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings
or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   Section 1.03.
Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   Section
1.04. Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. The
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein, by the DGCL or by applicable Law, except that Article I of the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the
corporation shall be Inamed Corporation."   Section 1.05. Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. At and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until amended as provided therein, by
the DGCL or by applicable Law.   Section 1.06. Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation.   (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the
manner provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by Law.   (b) The officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the
Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by Law.   ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
OF  THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   Section 2.01.
Conversion of Securities.   (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any shares of common stock, par    2   value $0.01 per
share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") or any capital stock of Merger
Sub:   (i) Subject to this Article II, each share of Company Common  Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section  2.01(a)(ii) and Dissenting
Shares referred to in Section 2.03) shall  be converted into the right to
receive (A) 1.4205 (the "EXCHANGE  RATIO") shares of Class A common stock,
par value $0.014 per share  ("PARENT COMMON STOCK"), of Parent (the "STOCK
MERGER  CONSIDERATION") and (B) $30.00 in cash, without interest (the "CASH 
MERGER CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Stock Merger  Consideration, the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION"), payable upon the  surrender of the Certificates (as
defined in Section 2.04(b)). From  and after the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common  Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a  Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any  rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon 
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.04, the  Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(a), any cash in  lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and  any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is  entitled pursuant to Section
2.04(c), without interest.   (ii) All shares of Company Common Stock that
are (A) held by  the Company as treasury shares or (B) owned by Parent or
any  wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, in each case, immediately prior  to
the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and retired and shall  cease to exist,
and no cash, securities of Parent or other  consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.   (iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share,  of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and 
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of  the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Change in Shares. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for,
a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Cash Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and
the Option Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   (c)
Associated Rights. References in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock shall
include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated preference
share purchase rights ("PARENT RIGHTS") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement dated as of August 15, 1995 between Parent and American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent, as amended (the "PARENT
RIGHTS AGREEMENT"). References in this Agreement to    3   Company
Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise,
the associated preferred share purchase rights ("COMPANY RIGHTS") issued
pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of November
16, 1999 by and between the Company and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, as
Rights Agent, as amended prior to the Effective Time (the "COMPANY RIGHTS
AGREEMENT").   Section 2.02. Adjustment to Merger Consideration.   (a) If
the amount obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Parent Stock Value by (y)
the Closing Transaction Value is less than 0.4500, the following shall
occur:   (i) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to a number, rounded  to
the nearest fourth decimal place, equal to (x) the product of 0.4500  and the
Closing Transaction Value, divided by (y) the product of the  Aggregate
Company Share Number and the Closing Parent Stock Price; and   (ii) The Cash
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to an  amount, rounded to the nearest
cent, equal to the quotient obtained by  dividing (x) the amount obtained by
subtracting the Aggregate Dissenter\'s  Value from the product of 0.5500 and
the Closing Transaction Value, by (y)  the Aggregate Company Share
Number.   (b) In the event that the Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Merger Consideration are adjusted as provided for in this Section 2.02, all
references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" and the "Cash Merger
Consideration" shall refer to the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Merger
Consideration as adjusted in this Section 2.02 except as may be otherwise
specified herein.   (c) For purposes of this Section 2.02, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:   (i) "AGGREGATE DISSENTER\'S
VALUE" means the product of (x) the  aggregate number of Dissenting Shares
determined at Closing, and (y) the  sum of (1) the Cash Merger Consideration
(before any adjustment pursuant  to Section 2.02) and (2) the product of the
Exchange Ratio (before any  adjustment pursuant to Section 2.02) and the
Closing Parent Stock Price.   (ii) "AGGREGATE CASH AMOUNT" means the product
of (x) the Cash  Merger Consideration (before any adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.02) and  (y) the Aggregate Company Share Number.   (iii)
"AGGREGATE COMPANY SHARE NUMBER" means the number  obtained by subtracting
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company  Common Stock to be cancelled
in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii)  and (y) the aggregate number
of Dissenting Shares determined at Closing,  from (z) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock  outstanding on the Closing Date.   
4    (iv) "AGGREGATE PARENT SHARE NUMBER" means the product of (x)  the
Exchange Ratio (before any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.02) and  (y) the
Aggregate Company Share Number.   (v) "AGGREGATE PARENT STOCK VALUE" means
the product of (x)  the Aggregate Parent Share Number (before any adjustment
pursuant to  Section 2.02) and (y) the Closing Parent Stock Price.   (vi)
"CLOSING PARENT STOCK PRICE" means the mean between the  high and low selling
prices, regular way, of the Parent Common Stock on  the NYSE on the date of
the Effective Time.   (vii) "CLOSING TRANSACTION VALUE" means the sum of (x)
the  Aggregate Cash Amount, (y) the Aggregate Parent Stock Value and (z)
the  Aggregate Dissenters Value.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Section 2.02 shall have no force and effect,
if, prior to the Closing Date, final or temporary Treasury Regulations are
promulgated or other guidance is issued by the IRS upon which the parties to
this Agreement can rely, with an effective date prior to the Closing Date, in
substantially the same form or with substantially the same effect of Proposed
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(2) (REG-129706-04; August 10,
2004).   Section 2.03. Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder
thereof who shall not have voted to adopt this Agreement and who properly
exercises and perfects appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES") will not be converted as
described in Section 2.01(a) but shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, the right of such holder to such appraisal of its shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease and such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be deemed converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to which any such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which any such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(c). The Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the
Company and (b) the opportunity to direct in compliance with all applicable
Laws all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisals
under the DGCL; provided, that any definitive actions taken by the Company at
the direction of Parent in respect of any such negotiations and proceedings
may be conditioned upon occurrence of the Effective Time. The Company shall
not, except with prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii)
offer to settle, or settle, any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to
timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or
(iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.    5    Section 2.04. Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent
and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates
representing a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
held by holders of record other than Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, rounded down to the nearest whole number
and (ii) an amount of cash sufficient to deliver to holders of Company Common
Stock the Cash Merger Consideration. For purposes of such deposit, Parent
shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock. Parent further agrees to provide to the Exchange Agent, from time to
time as needed, immediately available funds sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Any cash and certificates
representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND." The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid per share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.01 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.04(c) and
2.04(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.   (b) Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate formerly representing Company Common
Stock (a "CERTIFICATE"), other than Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (i) a letter of transmittal that shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, which letter shall be in customary form and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(a)(i) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such holder), (B) the Cash Merger Consideration which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) in respect of the shares
represented by such Certificate and/or (C) a check in the amount equal to the
cash that such holder has the right to receive with respect to any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and dividends and
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(c), if any, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i), Section 2.04(c) or
Section 2.04(e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid with respect to such Company
Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares
of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
this Section 2.04(b), accompanied by all    6   documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.   (c) No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock, with a record date after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.04(e), unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.04(b). Subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect
to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) The Merger Consideration delivered
upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.04(c) or Section 2.04(e))
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.   (e) No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, or book-entry
credit of the same, shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent. For purposes of this Section 2.04(e),
all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall
be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to the fourth decimal point.
In lieu of any such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, each holder of
Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock will be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) an amount equal to the
average of the closing sale prices for Parent Common Stock on the NYSE, as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, Northeastern edition, for each of the
ten consecutive trading days ending with the second complete trading day
prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and, from
and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.    7    (g) Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.   (h) If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.04(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon.   (i) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.   (j) The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by
Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 2.04(f). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by
the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the
Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.   Section 2.05.
Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided
herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented
to the Exchange Agent or Parent, for any reason, in accordance with Section
2.04(b), shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.04(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(c), in each case,
without any interest thereon.    8    Section 2.06. Stock Options.  
(a) At the Effective Time and without any action on the part of the parties
hereto, each unexercised and unexpired stock option that is then outstanding
under the Company Stock Plans (other than options outstanding under the
Company\'s 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 OPTION PLAN") or the
Company\'s 2000 Stock Option Plan (the "2000 OPTION PLAN")), which options
shall be treated as set forth in Section 2.06(b), whether vested or unvested
(the "EXCHANGE OPTIONS"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the
terms (as in effect at the Effective Time) of the Company Stock Plans, the
stock option agreement by which such Exchange Option is evidenced (including
any amendments thereto) and this Agreement, and converted into an option to
purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.06(a). Each
Exchange Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including restrictions on vesting and
exercisability) as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and any
applicable agreement thereunder, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Exchange
Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Exchange
Option, whether or not exercisable, immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by 2.3674 (the "OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO"), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Exchange Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Exchange Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, (iii) the vesting requirements applicable to each Exchange Option which
is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and remains outstanding at
the Effective Time shall automatically lapse and such Exchange Option shall
become immediately vested and exercisable for all of the shares Parent Common
Stock at the time subject to such Exchange Option and may be exercised for
any or all of those shares as fully vested shares, (iv) all references in the
Company Stock Plan and the agreement evidencing the Exchange Option to the
Company shall be deemed to be references to Parent and (v) all references in
the Company Stock Plan and the agreement evidencing the Exchange Option to
Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be references to Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.06(a), the
conversion of any Company Stock Options (regardless of whether such options
qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code) into options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made in such a
manner as would not constitute a "modification" of such Company Stock Options
within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code.   (b) At the Effective Time
and without any action on the part of the parties hereto, each unexercised
and unexpired stock option that is then outstanding under the 1999 Option
Plan or the 2000 Option Plan, whether vested or unvested (the "CONVERSION
OPTIONS" and together with the Exchange Options, the "COMPANY STOCK
OPTIONS"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in
effect at the Effective Time) of the 1999 Option Plan or 2000 Option Plan, as
applicable, and the stock option agreement by which such Conversion Option is
evidenced (including any amendments thereto) and this Agreement and converted
into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock and an
amount of cash as determined in accordance with this Section 2.06(b). Each
Conversion Option so converted shall    9   continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including restrictions on vesting
and exercisability) as set forth in the 1999 Option Plan or 2000 Option Plan,
as applicable, and any applicable agreements thereunder, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective
Time, (i) each Conversion Option shall be exercisable for the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration the optionee would have been entitled to
receive in connection with the Merger in the event he or she exercised
the Conversion Option immediately prior to the Effective Time for the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Conversion Option, whether or not exercisable, (ii) the exercise price
per Unit shall be equal to the sum obtained by dividing the aggregate
exercise price payable for the Company Common Stock for which such Conversion
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the number
of Units subject to such Conversion Option immediately following the
Effective Time, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, (iii) the vesting
requirements applicable to each Conversion Option which is outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement and remains outstanding at the Effective Time
shall automatically lapse and such Conversion Option shall become immediately
vested and exercisable for all of the Units at the time subject to such
Conversion Option and may be exercised for any or all of such Units without
vesting restrictions, (iv) all references in the 1999 Option Plan and the
2000 Option Plan and the agreement evidencing the Conversion Option to the
Company shall be deemed to be references to Parent, and (v) all references in
the 1999 Option Plan and the 2000 Option Plan and the agreement evidencing
the Conversion Option to Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be
references to either Parent Common Stock or Units, as the context requires.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustments to be made to the Conversion
Options (regardless of whether such options qualify as "incentive stock
options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) shall be made in such
a manner as would not be intended to constitute a "modification" of
such Conversion Options within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. For
purposes of this Section 2.06, "UNIT" shall mean one share of Parent Common
Stock plus an amount of cash equal to the sum obtained by dividing (x) the
aggregate amount of cash for which the Conversion Option is exercisable
immediately following the Effective Time (as determined pursuant to (i)
above) by (y) the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Conversion Option immediately following the Effective Time
(as determined pursuant to (i) above), rounded down to the nearest whole
cent. In no event will a Conversion Option be exercisable for a fraction of a
Unit.   (c) Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable, and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the Parent
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Options, (ii) prior to such filing,
take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary to cover under such
registration statement (or on a Form S-3 or any other successor or other
appropriate form reasonably satisfactory to those persons whose shares are
not covered by the Form S-8) shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Company Stock Options held by those persons eligible under the Company\'s
registration statement on Form S-8 immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
(iii) maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement(s) (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus(es) contained in such
registration statement(s)) for so long as the Company Stock Options remain
outstanding.   Section 2.07. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall
take all requisite action with respect to the Company\'s 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended    10   (the "COMPANY ESPP"), to ensure that
(i) all Company Purchase Rights (as defined in Section 3.02) issued and
outstanding as of the date of the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in
Section 3.04) will be exercised on such date, (ii) no Company Purchase Rights
will be issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, (iii) conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company ESPP will be terminated no
later than the Effective Time, and (iv) the Company ESPP will be suspended as
of the date of the Company Stockholder Approval and no additional offering
periods shall commence on or after the date of the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall deliver to Parent prior to the Effective Time
sufficient evidence that the Company ESPP will be terminated no later than
the Effective Time. In addition, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the Company ESPP and the terms of any offering period(s) commencing
prior to the Effective Time) that are necessary to provide that, as of the
date of the Company Stockholder Approval, participants and former
participants in the Company ESPP shall cease to have any right or interest
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all actions taken and
all amendments made pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be taken or made
in compliance with Sections 423 and 424 of the Code and so as not to result
in a "modification" under such Sections. All shares of Company Common Stock
issued in connection with the exercise of the Company Purchase Rights shall
be, at the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with, and pursuant to, the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.   Section 2.08. Restricted Stock. All outstanding rights
of the Company which it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to
acquire unvested shares of the Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the
Company Restricted Stock Plan (the "REPURCHASE RIGHTS") shall lapse at the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Repurchase Rights which
the Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to acquire
unvested shares of the Company Common Stock issued after March 20, 2005 (the
"ASSIGNED REPURCHASE RIGHTS") shall be assigned to Parent at the Effective
Time and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
the Assigned Repurchase Rights shall be adjusted to apply to the Merger
Consideration received in exchange for the unvested shares of the Company
Common Stock subject to the Assigned Repurchase Rights and (ii) the
repurchase price to be paid (if any) for the Merger Consideration received in
exchange for a share of Company Restricted Stock shall be an amount
determined by dividing the repurchase price per share of Company Restricted
Stock, as determined immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole cent. In the event that the
exercise of an Assigned Repurchase Right would result in the return of Cash
Merger Consideration to Parent, Parent shall be entitled to offset the Cash
Merger Consideration to be returned against the repurchase price (if any) to
be paid.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
The Company represents and warrants to Parent that except as set forth in the
disclosure letter dated as of the date hereof delivered by the Company to
Parent (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER"):    11    Section 3.01.
Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, license and operate
its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company is qualified to transact business and,
where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned, leased, licensed or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except as would

Company Material Adverse Effect. True, accurate and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, in each case, as
amended and in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto,
have heretofore been filed with the SEC or delivered to Parent.   Section
3.02. Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"). As

Common Stock authorized and reserved for future issuance upon exercise of
Company Stock Options issued and outstanding) and the Company ESPP and (vi)
25,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock were designated as Series A Junior
Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and were reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the Company Rights issued pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a complete
and correct copy of the Company Rights Agreement as in effect on the date
hereof. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Company is,
and each share of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance as specified
above will be, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which it is issuable, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.
Since March 10, 2005 through the date hereof, except as permitted by this
Agreement, (i) no shares of Company Common Stock have been issued, except in
connection with the exercise of purchase rights issued in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP ("COMPANY PURCHASE RIGHTS") or Company Stock
Options issued and outstanding and (ii) no options, warrants, securities
convertible into, or commitments with respect to the issuance of, shares of
capital stock of the Company have been issued, granted or made, except
Company Rights in accordance with the terms of the Company Rights
Agreement.   (b) Except for Company Rights, Company Purchase Rights and
Company Stock Options issued and outstanding, as of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, calls, contracts,
commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements, rights or warrants,
including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or other agreement and also including any rights plan or other
anti-takeover agreement, obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to issue, deliver or sell, or    12   cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of Company Common Stock or obligating
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any such agreement or commitment. As of the date hereof, there are
no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the Company to (i) repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or the capital
stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii)
provide material funds to, or make any material investment in (in the form of
a loan, capital contribution or otherwise), or provide any guarantee with
respect to the obligations of, any Person other than a Subsidiary. There are
no outstanding stock appreciation rights or similar derivative securities or
rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. There
are no voting trusts, irrevocable proxies or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a
party or is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of Company Common
Stock. The Company\'s Board of Directors has taken all action such that, for
so long as this Agreement is in full force and effect, (i) none of Merger Sub
or Parent and its Subsidiaries shall become an "Acquiring Person" and no
"Shares Acquisition Date" shall occur as a result of the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) no
"Distribution Date" shall occur as a result of the announcement of or the
execution of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (iii) the Company Rights Agreement shall terminate immediately prior to
the Effective Time. As used in this Section 3.02(b), the terms "Acquiring
Person," "Distribution Date" and "Shares Acquisition Date" shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Company Rights Agreement. The Company
has not agreed to register any securities under the Securities Act or under
any state securities law or granted registration rights to any Person (except
rights which have terminated or expired). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any outstanding obligations in respect of prior acquisitions
of businesses to pay, in the form of securities, cash or other property, any
portion of the consideration payable to the seller or sellers in such
transaction.   (c) The Company has previously made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of each Company Stock Plan and the Company ESPP.
Section 3.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list as of March 18, 2005, of (i) all holders of outstanding Company
Stock Options, whether or not granted under the Company Stock Plans,
including the date of grant, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
originally granted subject to each such option, the exercise price per share,
the exercise and vesting schedule, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock remaining subject to each such option, and the maximum term of each
such option, (ii) all holders of outstanding shares of Company Restricted
Stock, including the number and kind of shares subject to the Repurchase
Rights, the grant date of such shares, the purchase price per share at which
the Company may repurchase the Company Restricted Stock, and the period
during which each Repurchase Right may be exercised, and (iii) the number of

Company ESPP have been provided to Parent by the Company.    13   
Section 3.03. Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized,
validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to
own, lease, license and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and each Subsidiary of the Company is
qualified to transact business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
in which the properties owned, leased, licensed or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except in all cases as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
each Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights and are owned directly or indirectly by the
Company. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants, voting trusts,
proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements
relating to the issuance, sale, voting or transfer of any shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company, including
any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement. The Company has no material investment in any entity
other than its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.04. Authority; Non-Contravention;
Approvals.   (a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and,
subject to obtaining necessary stockholder approval in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the affirmative votes of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors generally and the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to vote at a duly
called and held meeting of the Company\'s stockholders is the only vote of
the holders of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve and adopt
this Agreement and the Merger (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL").   (b)
At a meeting duly called and held on March 20, 2005, the Board of Directors
of the Company unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and the Company\'s stockholders,
(ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend   
14   approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company\'s stockholders. The actions taken by the Board of Directors of the
Company constitute approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the Board of Directors of the Company
under the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL such that the restrictions on
"business combinations" as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. No other takeover
statute or other similar statute or regulation relating to the Company is
applicable to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without giving effect to the execution of this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any affiliate or associate of the Company is, or has been during the last
three years, an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) of Parent.   (c) The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate, conflict with,
give rise to the right to modify or result in a breach of any provision of,
or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination
or acceleration under, or require any offer to purchase or any prepayment of
any debt, or result in the creation of any Lien, security interest or
encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) the
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar governing
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ,
permit or license of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, subject
in the case of consummation, to obtaining the Company Required Statutory
Approvals and the Company Stockholder Approval, or (iii) any Company Permit
or Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, other than, in the case of
(ii) and (iii) above, such violations, conflicts, rights to modify, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or creations of Liens, security
interests or encumbrances that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d)
Except for (i) the filings by the Company required by the HSR Act, (ii) the
filings by the Company required by Antitrust Laws of foreign jurisdictions,
(iii) the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (iv) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger and (v) any required filings under the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ National Market (the filings and approvals referred
to in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the "COMPANY REQUIRED STATUTORY
APPROVALS"), no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary
for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, other than such declarations, filings,
registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not
made or obtained, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.    15    Section 3.05. Reports and Financial Statements.   (a)
Since January 1, 2001, the Company has filed with the SEC all material forms,
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules and documents
(including all exhibits, post-effective amendments and supplements thereto)
(the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS") required to be filed by it under each of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, all of which, as amended if
applicable, complied in all material respects as to form with all applicable
requirements of the appropriate Act, SOX and the rules and regulations
thereunder. As of their respective dates (taking into account any amendments
or supplements filed prior to the date hereof), the Company SEC Documents did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former
principal executive officer of the Company and each former principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and
906 of SOX and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and to the knowledge of the
Company, the statements contained in such certifications are true and
correct. For purposes of this Section 3.05(b), "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in SOX. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or
has arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or
executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.   (c) The
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or 8-K or the applicable rules of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not
material). The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements.   (d) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
contract or arrangement (including any contract or arrangement relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or    16   material Liabilities of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company\'s or such Subsidiary\'s published
financial statements or other of the Company SEC Documents.   (e) The
Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.   (f) The Company has in place the "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) required in order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company to engage in the review and evaluation process
mandated by the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. The
Company\'s "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\'s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.   (g) Since December 31, 2000, the Company has not received from

against, which relate to or affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, decree,

Company Material Adverse Effect. There has not, within the last four years,

Parent with the SEC to register the shares of Parent Common Stock to be

Company\'s    18   stockholders in connection with the meeting of the
Company\'s stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING") to be called
to consider this Agreement and to Parent\'s stockholders in connection with
the meeting of Parent\'s stockholders (the "PARENT STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING")
to be called to consider the Share Issuance and (c) any other documents to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will, at the respective times such documents are filed and at the time such
documents become effective or at the time any amendment or supplement thereto
becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit
to state any material fact required or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading; and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it
becomes effective or at the time any amendment or supplement thereto becomes
effective, will cause the Registration Statement or such supplement
or amendment to contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or which is necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of
the Joint Proxy Statement, when first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and the stockholders of Parent, or in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting or the time of the Parent Stockholders\'

The Company, its Subsidiaries and their employees hold all authorizations,
permits, licenses, certificates, easements, concessions, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations, approvals and
clearances of all Governmental Entities (including, without limitation,
all those that may be required by the FDA or any other Governmental Entity
engaged in the regulation of the Company\'s products) which are required for
the Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease, license and operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on their respective business in the
manner described in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof
and as they are being conducted as of the date hereof (the "COMPANY
PERMITS"), and all the Company Permits are valid, and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any such
Company Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The Company and
its Subsidiaries are, and have been at all times since January 1, 2001, in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits and all applicable Laws
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
assets or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits or such applicable Law would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Company Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notification from any Governmental Entity
(i) asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in
material compliance with, or at any time since such    19   date has
failed to materially comply with, applicable Law or (ii) threatening
to revoke any material Company Permit. As of the date hereof, no
material investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, has been threatened against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.11. Company Material Contracts;
Defaults.   (a) As of the date hereof and except as filed as exhibits to
the Company\'s SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to, and none of their respective assets, businesses or operations
is bound by, any Contract (whether written or oral) that (i) is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(a)(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act), (ii) relates to any indebtedness in
excess of $500,000, (iii) provides for aggregate payments from it or any of
its Subsidiaries in excess of $500,000, has an unexpired term exceeding six
months, cannot be terminated without penalty upon not more than sixty (60)
days\' prior written notice, and which has yet-to-be performed executory
obligations, (iv) materially limits its freedom or the freedom of any of its
Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any Person or in any
geographical area or which would so materially limit its freedom or the
freedom of any of its Subsidiaries so to compete after the Effective Time,
(v) relates to the research, development, distribution, supply, license, co-
promotion or manufacturing by other Persons of Company Key Products which
Contract, if terminated or non-renewed, would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on any Company Key Product; (vi) that relates to a
Company Key Product and purports to prohibit the Company or any Subsidiary
from contesting the validity or ownership of any other Person\'s patent or
from challenging the inventorship of any other Person\'s invention; (vii)
which relates to a Company Key Product and where, in settlement of an actual
or threatened action for patent infringement, trade secrets misappropriation
or similar intellectual property action, the Company or any Subsidiary
purports to acknowledge or agree that certain acts infringe or misappropriate
the rights of another Person; (viii) where, in settlement of an actual or
threatened action for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation or
similar intellectual property action, another Person agrees in writing not to
contest the validity or ownership of Company Owned Intellectual Property
which relates to a Company Key Product; (ix) relating to the right of the
Company or any Subsidiary to use the name "McGhan"; or (x) to the extent not
included within the foregoing, each Company Material License (collectively,
the "COMPANY MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). Except for Company Material Contracts
which have expired pursuant to their terms after the date hereof, each of the
Company Material Contracts is valid and binding on the Company or
its Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Company\'s knowledge, each other
Person thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable against the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms
(except as enforcement may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights or by
general equity principles and (ii) to the extent applicable, securities laws
limitations on the enforceability of provisions regarding indemnification in
connection with the sale or issuance of securities).   (b) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation, breach or default under
any of the Company Material Contracts, and there has not occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a violation, breach or default, except for such breaches or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,   
20   reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.
No other Person has alleged or claimed that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge, any sublicensee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, is in violation, breach or default under any
Company Material Contract, except for such breaches or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.12. Taxes.   (a) Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly and timely filed with the
appropriate Tax authority all Tax Returns required to be filed by it through
the date hereof, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all respects and (ii) paid all Taxes due and owing (whether or not shown due
on any Tax Returns), except in each case where the failure to pay such Taxes
or the failure of such Tax Returns to be true, correct or complete in
all respects would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever been
made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where the Company and its
Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.   (b)
The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the date
of the financial statements contained in the most recent Company SEC Filings,
exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any
notes thereto) contained in such financial statements. Since the date of the
financial statements in the most recent Company SEC Filings, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes
outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with past
custom and practice, except for any liability for Taxes which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any
property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, except for Liens
(i) for Taxes contested in good faith and reserved against in accordance with
GAAP and reflected in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof
or (ii) that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) No deficiencies
for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
set forth or claimed in writing, or proposed or assessed by a Tax authority.
There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, proposed or
threatened audits, investigations, disputes or claims or other actions for or
relating to any Liability for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and there are no matters under discussion with any Tax
authority, or known to the Company, with respect to Taxes that are likely to
result in a material additional Liability for Taxes with respect to any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. No issues relating to Taxes of the Company
or its Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in
any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be   
21   expected to recur with a Company Material Adverse Effect on Taxes in a
later taxable period. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
true and complete copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2002, 2003 and promptly upon their availability,
2004, and true and complete copies of all examination reports and statements
of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any predecessor, with respect to Taxes. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, or has made any request in writing
for any such extension or waiver.   (e) Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party, and all
Tax Returns (including without limitation all IRS Forms W-2 and 1099)
required with respect thereto have been properly completed and timely filed
in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
classified any individual as an "independent contractor" or similar non-
employee status who, according to any Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law,
should have been classified as an employee.   (f) There are no Tax sharing
agreements or similar arrangements (including indemnity arrangements) with
respect to or involving any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, after
the Closing Date, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be bound by
any such Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements or have any Liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing
Date.   (g) Except for the affiliated group of which the Company is
the common parent, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not and has
never been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning
of Section 1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has Liability for the Taxes of any Person (including an
individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, labor union
or other entity or Governmental Entity) other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor,
(iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.   (h) The Company has not constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) that includes the Merger.   (i) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.    22    (j) None of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (i) has consented at any time under former Section
341(f)(1) of the Code to have the provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of
the Code apply to any disposition of the assets of the Company (or under any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law); (ii) has agreed, or is or
was required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by
reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise (or by reason of any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law); (iii) has ever been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code; (iv) has been a stockholder of a "controlled foreign
corporation" as defined in Section 957 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), (v) has ever made an election under Section
338 of the Code (or under any similar provisions of state, local or foreign
Law), (vi) has been a "personal holding company" as defined in Section 542 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law); (vii) has
had a material Liability with respect to Taxes as a result of being
a stockholder of a "passive foreign investment company" within the meaning
of Section 1297 of the Code; or (viii) has engaged in a trade or business,
had a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable Tax
treaty) or has otherwise become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a country
other than the country of its formation.   (k) Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been a party to a "reportable transaction," as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) or to a
transaction that is or is substantially similar to a "listed transaction," as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2), or any
other transaction requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state,
local or foreign Tax law. The Company has disclosed on its federal income Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code Section
6662.   Section 3.13. Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.   (a) Section 3.13(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter includes a complete list, as of the date
hereof, of each material employee benefit plan, program or policy providing
benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent thereof
that is sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated
to contribute, or with respect to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has or may have any Liability or obligations, including
any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
or any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) and any material
bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock
option, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit or
similar arrangement, agreement, plan, program or policy (collectively, the
"COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS"). The Company has made available to Parent a copy of
each of the Company Benefit Plans, including any amendments thereto, and
where applicable, any related trust agreement, annuity or insurance contract,
the most recent actuarial valuation, the most recent summary plan
description, the most recent prospectus, the most recent IRS determination
letter, and the most recent annual report (Form 5500) and audited financial
statements.   (b) Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect:
(i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have    23   complied, and are now
in compliance, with all provisions of all laws and regulations applicable to
Company Benefit Plans and each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in
accordance with its terms, including the making of all required contributions
and the reflection by the Company of all required accruals on its financial
statements; (ii) no event or condition exists which would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Liability in
connection with the Company Benefit Plans or any plan, program, or policy
sponsored or contributed to by any of their respective ERISA Affiliates other
than the provision of benefits thereunder in the ordinary course; and (iii)
there are no pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened Actions
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) relating to Company
Benefit Plans which have been asserted or instituted and which would
reasonably be expected to result in any Liability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.   (c) In no event will the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any other related agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the stockholder approval of
the Merger (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
exercisability, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of,
any material payment or benefit to any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof or result in a limitation on the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust.   (d) Section
3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each Company Benefit Plan
that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code or is intended to be similarly qualified or registered
under applicable foreign law (collectively, the "COMPANY QUALIFIED PLANS").
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the IRS (or other relevant foreign
regulatory agency) has issued a favorable determination letter (or similar
approval under foreign law) with respect to each Company Qualified Plan and
the related trust that has not been revoked, and the Company knows of
no existing circumstances or events that have occurred that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified
Plan or the related trust, which cannot be cured without a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (e) No Company Benefit Plan or Company ERISA Affiliate
Plan is, or has ever been, subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code.   (f) No Company Benefit Plan or Company
ERISA Affiliate Plan is, or has ever been, a Multiemployer Plan.   (g)
There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, including but not limited to the
provisions of this Agreement, that, individually or collectively, could give
rise to the payment of any material amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.   (h) No amount that could be
received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other   
24   related agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or the stockholder approval of the Merger (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment), by
any employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan or
otherwise could be characterized as a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code). The Company has made available to Parent all
necessary information to determine, as of the date hereof, the estimated
maximum amount that could be paid to each disqualified individual in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under all
employment, severance and termination agreements, other compensation
arrangements and Company Benefit Plans currently in effect, assuming that the
individual\'s employment with the Company is terminated immediately after the
Effective Time. The Company has also provided to Parent (i) the grant dates,
exercise prices and vesting schedules applicable to each Company Option
granted to the individual; (ii) the grant dates and vesting schedules
applicable to each grant of Company Restricted Stock, (iii) the "base amount"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(e) of the Code) for each such individual as of
the date of this Agreement and (iv) the maximum additional amount that the
Company has an obligation to pay to each disqualified individual to reimburse
the disqualified individual for any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of
the Code with respect to the disqualified individual\'s excess parachute
payments (including any taxes, interest or penalties imposed with respect to
the excise tax).   Section 3.14. Labor and Other Employment Matters(a) .  
(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) no work stoppage,
slowdown, lockout, labor strike, material arbitration or other material labor
dispute against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by employees is
pending or threatened, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is delinquent in payments to any of its employees for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed
for it or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees, (iii) the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices,
terms and conditions of employment, workers\' compensation, occupational
safety, plant closings, and wage and hours, (iv) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has withheld all amounts required by Law or by agreement to be
withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees and is not
liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to
comply with any of the foregoing, (v) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any
Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits,
social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than
routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice), (vi) there are no material pending claims against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any workers\' compensation plan or
policy or for long term disability and (vii) there are no material
controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former employees, which controversies have or could reasonably be
expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or
investigation before any Governmental Entity. To the Company\'s knowledge, as
of the date hereof, no employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are in any material respect in violation of any term of any employment
Contract,    25   non-disclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement, or
any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any
such employee to be employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted by the Company or such Subsidiary or to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others. As of the date hereof, no employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at the officer level or above, has given
notice to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that any such employee
intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining Contract with a
labor union or labor organization, nor is any such Contract presently being
negotiated. From January 1, 2001 to the date hereof, there has not been a
representation question respecting any of the employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
campaigns being conducted to solicit cards from employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to authorize representation by any labor
organization.   (c) The Company has identified in Section 3.14(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of (i) all severance and employment agreements with directors,
officers or employees of or consultants to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) all severance programs and policies of each of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees, and (iii) all
plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of each of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its directors, officers,
employees or consultants which contain change in control provisions. In no
event will the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other related
agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or the stockholder approval of the Merger (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment) (x)
result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Company Benefit
Plan or otherwise, (y) significantly increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, or (z) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits.   (d) Each
current and, to the best of Company\'s knowledge, former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is or was engaged in the invention of
products or development of technology or authoring of computer software or
other copyrighted materials for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
executed a written contract obligating such Person to assign to the Company
or such Subsidiary all of his or her right, title and interest in any such
invention, technology or work of authorship, except where the failure to have
executed such a written contract would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a material adverse effect on a Company Key Product.   Section 3.15.

Stock or the capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of
Parent or (ii) provide material funds to, or make any material investment in
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise), or provide any
guarantee with respect to the obligations of, any Person other than a
Subsidiary. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights or similar
derivative securities or rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There
are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote.
There are no voting trusts, irrevocable proxies or other agreements or
understandings to which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is a party or is
bound with respect to the voting of any shares of Parent Common Stock. None
of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall become an "Acquiring Person" and no
"Shares Acquisition Date" shall occur as a result of the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, and no
"Distribution Date" shall occur as a result of the announcement of or the
execution of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
As used in this Section 4.02(b), the terms "Acquiring Person," "Distribution
Date" and "Shares Acquisition Date" shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Parent Rights Agreement. Parent has not agreed to register any
securities under the Securities Act or under any state securities law or
granted registration rights to any Person (except rights which have
terminated or expired). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any outstanding obligations in respect of prior acquisitions of businesses to
pay, in the form of securities, cash or other property, any portion of
the consideration payable to the seller or sellers in such transaction.   
36   (c) Parent has previously made available to the Company complete
and correct copies of each Parent Stock Plan. Section 4.02(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list as of March
18, 2005, of all holders of outstanding Parent Stock Options, whether or not
granted under the Parent Stock Plans, including the date of grant, the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock originally granted subject to each such
option, the exercise price per share, the exercise and vesting schedule, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock remaining subject to each such
option, and the maximum term of each such option. Complete and correct copies
of the relevant forms of written agreements, including forms of amendments
thereto, evidencing the grant of Parent Stock Options have been provided to
the Company by Parent.   Section 4.03. Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary of
Parent is duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease, license and operate its assets
and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and
each Subsidiary of Parent is qualified to transact business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased,
licensed or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification necessary, except in all cases as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of each Subsidiary of Parent are validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned directly or
indirectly by Parent. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants,
voting trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions
or arrangements relating to the issuance, sale, voting or transfer of any
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of
Parent, including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding
security, instrument or agreement. Parent has no material investment in any
entity other than its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.04. Authority; Non-
Contravention; Approvals.   (a) Parent has all necessary power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder
and, subject to obtaining necessary stockholder approval in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent of this Agreement, and the consummation by Parent of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the approval of the
Share Issuance by Parent\'s stockholders and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and approval of this
Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which approval of
Parent shall be obtained promptly after the date hereof)). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Parent enforceable against Parent in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and the effect
of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at    37  law). The
affirmative vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock representing
a majority of the votes cast on the proposal relating to the Share
Issuance, provided that the total vote cast on the proposal represents over
50% in interest of all shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote on the
proposal, is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of Parent
necessary to approve the Share Issuance (the "PARENT STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL").   (b) At a meeting duly called and held on March 20, 2005, the
Board of Directors of Parent (i) determined that this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Share Issuance, are
advisable and in the best interests of Parent and Parent\'s stockholders,
(ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Share Issuance, and (iii) resolved to recommend
approval of the Share Issuance by Parent\'s stockholders. No takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation relating to Parent is applicable to the
Merger or to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without giving
effect to the execution of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any affiliate
or associate of Parent is, or has been during the last three years, an
"interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the
Company.   (c) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the transactions contemplated by the Financing
Commitment Letter) do not and will not violate, conflict with, give rise to
the right to modify or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute
a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or require any offer to purchase or any prepayment of any
debt, or result in the creation of any Lien, security interest or encumbrance
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) the respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar governing documents of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of
any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, subject in the case of
consummation, to obtaining the Parent Required Statutory Approvals and the
Parent Stockholder Approval, or (iii) any Parent Permit or Contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
or affected, other than, in the case of (ii) and (iii) above, such
violations, conflicts, rights to modify, breaches, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or creations of Liens, security interests or encumbrances that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Except for (i) the filings by Parent
required by the HSR Act, (ii) the filings by Parent required by Antitrust
Laws of foreign jurisdictions, (iii) the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, (iv) the filing of the Certificate of Merger and (v) any
required filings under the rules and regulations of NYSE (the filings and
approvals referred to in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the "PARENT
REQUIRED STATUTORY APPROVALS"), no declaration, filing or registration with,
or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent or the consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, other than such declarations, filings,   
38  registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if
not made or obtained, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.05. Reports and Financial Statements.   (a) Since
January 1, 2001, Parent has filed with the SEC all material forms,
registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules and
documents (including all exhibits, post-effective amendments and supplements
thereto) (the "PARENT SEC DOCUMENTS") required to be filed by it under each
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, all of which, as amended if
applicable, complied in all material respects as to form with all applicable
requirements of the appropriate Act, SOX and the rules and regulations
thereunder. As of their respective dates (taking into account any amendments
or supplements filed prior to the date hereof), the Parent SEC Documents did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the principal executive officer of
Parent and the principal financial officer of Parent (or each former
principal executive officer of Parent and each former principal financial
officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect
to the Parent SEC Documents, and to the knowledge of Parent, the statements
contained in such certifications are true and correct. For purposes of this
Section 4.05(b), "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.   (c) The consolidated financial statements of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q or
8-K or the applicable rules of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments which are not material). The books and records of Parent
and its Subsidiaries are maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements.   (d)
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any
contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between
or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item    39  303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract
or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material Liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parent\'s or
such Subsidiary\'s published financial statements or other the Parent SEC
Documents.   (e) Parent maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorizations;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.   (f) Parent has in place the "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
required in order for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
of Parent to engage in the review and evaluation process mandated by the
Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Parent\'s "disclosure
controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parent\'s management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.   (g) Since December
31, 2000, Parent has not received from its independent auditors any oral or
written notification of a (x) "reportable condition" or (y) "material
weakness" in Parent\'s internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on
the date hereof.   Section 4.06. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except
as disclosed in the audited financial statements included in Parent\'s Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2004 (the "PARENT 10-K") or the unaudited
financial statements included in Parent\'s Form 10-Q for the period ended
December 31, 2004 (the "PARENT 10-Q"), neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has as of the date hereof any Liabilities or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except
Liabilities, obligations or contingencies (a) which are accrued or reserved
against in the financial statements in the Parent 10-K or Parent 10-Q or
reflected in the notes thereto, (b) which were incurred in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices, (c) which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or (d) which are of a nature not required to
be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Parent and
its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.  
Section 4.07. Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents
prior to the date hereof, as of the date hereof, there are no
Actions pending, or, to the knowledge of    40  Parent, threatened in
writing against, which relate to or affect Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
before any court or other Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator which would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
There has not, within the last four years, been nor, as of the date hereof,
are there any internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by Parent,
the Board of Directors of Parent (or any committee thereof) or any
other Person at the request of any of the foregoing concerning any
financial, accounting, Tax, conflict of interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or
deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance issues.   Section
4.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events.   (a) Except as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Documents prior to the date hereof, since June 30, 2004 through
the date hereof:   (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
business only  in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;   (ii)
there has not been any split, combination or reclassification  of any of
Parent\'s capital stock or any declaration, setting aside or  payment of any
dividend on, or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or  property) in
respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for, shares of  Parent\'s capital
stock;   (iii) except as required by a change in GAAP, there has not been
any  change in accounting methods, principles or practices by Parent
materially  affecting the consolidated financial position or results of
operations of  Parent;   (iv) Parent and its Subsidiaries have not made any
material Tax  election or settled or compromised any material Tax liability
or refund,  other than Tax elections required by Law, or changed any annual
Tax  accounting period or method of Tax accounting, filed any material
amendment  to a Tax Return, entered into any closing agreement relating to
any material  Tax, surrendered any right to claim a material Tax refund, or
consented to  any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations period
applicable to  any material Tax claim or assessment; and   (v) no action
has been taken by Parent or its Subsidiaries to amend  or waive any
performance or vesting criteria or accelerate vesting,  exercisability or
funding under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Stock  Option.   (b) Since
June 30, 2004, there has not occurred any circumstance or event, or series of
circumstances or events, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 4.09. Registration Statement, Etc. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(a) the Registration Statement, (b) the Joint Proxy Statement and (c)
any other documents to be filed with the SEC in    41  connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby will, at the respective times such
documents are filed and at the time such documents become effective or at the
time any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material
fact required or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; and, in the
case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective or at the time
any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective, will cause the
Registration Statement or such supplement or amendment to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or which is necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading, or, in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement, when
first mailed to the stockholders of Parent and the stockholders of the
Company, or in the case of the Joint Proxy Statement or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto, at the time of the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting or
the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto to contain any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is made
by Parent with respect to statements made in any such documents based
on information supplied by the Company or with respect to information
concerning the Company which is incorporated by reference in such
documents.   Section 4.10. Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits.   (a)
Parent, its Subsidiaries and their employees hold all authorizations,
permits, licenses, certificates, easements, concessions, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations, approvals and
clearances of all Governmental Entities (including, without limitation,
all those that may be required by the FDA or any other Governmental Entity
engaged in the regulation of Parent\'s products) which are required for
Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease, license and operate its properties
and other assets and to carry on their respective business in the manner
described in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as
they are being conducted as of the date hereof (the "PARENT PERMITS"), and
all Parent Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to be
valid or in full force and effect of, any such Parent Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and have
been at all times since January 1, 2001, in compliance with the terms of the
Parent Permits and all applicable Laws relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or properties, except
where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits or
such applicable Law would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2001,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notification from
any Governmental Entity (i) asserting that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
is not in material compliance with, or at any time since such date has failed
to materially comply with, applicable Law or (ii) threatening to revoke any
material Parent Permit. As of the date hereof, no material investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
has been threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.    42  
Section 4.11. Parent Material Contracts; Defaults.   (a) As of the date
hereof and except as filed as exhibits to Parent\'s SEC Documents, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their
respective assets, businesses or operations is bound by, any Contract
(whether written or oral) that (i) is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(a)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act), (ii) relates to any indebtedness in excess of $500,000, (iii) provides
for aggregate payments from it or any of its Subsidiaries in excess
of $500,000, has an unexpired term exceeding six months, cannot be
terminated without penalty upon not more than sixty (60) days\' prior written
notice, and which has yet-to-be performed executory obligations, (iv)
materially limits its freedom or the freedom of any of its Subsidiaries to
compete in any line of business or with any Person or in any geographical
area or which would so materially limit its freedom or the freedom of any of
its Subsidiaries so to compete after the Effective Time, (v) relates to the
research, development, distribution, supply, license, co-promotion or
manufacturing by other Persons of Parent Key Products which Contract, if
terminated or non-renewed, would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on any Parent Key Product; (vi) that relates to a Parent Key
Product and purports to prohibit Parent or any Subsidiary from contesting the
validity or ownership of any other Person\'s patent or from challenging the
inventorship of any other Person\'s invention; (vii) which relates to a
Parent Key Product and where, in settlement of an actual or threatened action
for patent infringement, trade secrets misappropriation or similar
intellectual property action, Parent or any Subsidiary purports to
acknowledge or agree that certain acts infringe or misappropriate the rights
of another Person; (viii) where, in settlement of an actual or threatened
action for patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation or similar
intellectual property action, another Person agrees in writing not to contest
the validity or ownership of Parent Owned Intellectual Property which relates
to a Parent Key Product; or (ix) to the extent not included within the
foregoing, each Parent Material License (collectively, the "PARENT MATERIAL
CONTRACTS"). Except for Parent Material Contracts which have expired pursuant
to their terms after the date hereof, each of the Parent Material Contracts
is valid and binding on Parent or its Subsidiary party thereto and, to
Parent\'s knowledge, each other Person thereto, and is in full force and
effect and enforceable against Parent or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
in accordance with its terms (except as enforcement may be limited by (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors\' rights or by general equity principles and (ii) to the
extent applicable, securities laws limitations on the enforceability of
provisions regarding indemnification in connection with the sale or issuance
of securities).   (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation, breach or default under any of the Parent Material Contracts, and
there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both, would constitute such a violation, breach or default,
except for such breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. No other Person has alleged or claimed that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Parent\'s knowledge, any sublicensee of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, is in violation, breach or default under any Parent
Material Contract, except for such breaches or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.    43   Section 4.12. Taxes.   (a) Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly and timely filed with the
appropriate Tax authority all Tax Returns required to be filed by it through
the date hereof, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
all respects and (ii) paid all Taxes due and owing (whether or not shown
due on any Tax Returns), except in each case where the failure to pay such
Taxes or the failure of such Tax Returns to be true, correct or complete in
all respects would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever been made by
a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
file Tax Returns that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction.   (b) The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its
Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the financial statements contained in
the most recent Parent SEC Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial
statements. Since the date of the financial statements in the most recent
Parent SEC Filings, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice, except for any liability for
Taxes which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (c) There are no Liens
for Taxes upon any property or asset of Parent or any Subsidiary thereof,
except for Liens (i) for Taxes contested in good faith and reserved against
in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior
to the date hereof or (ii) that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (d) No
deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of Parent and its Subsidiaries
have been set forth or claimed in writing, or proposed or assessed by a Tax
authority. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, proposed or
threatened audits, investigations, disputes or claims or other actions for or
relating to any Liability for Taxes with respect to any of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and there are no matters under discussion with any
Tax authority, or known to Parent, with respect to Taxes that are likely to
result in a material additional Liability for Taxes with respect to any of
Parent and its Subsidiaries. No issues relating to Taxes of Parent or its
Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit
or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur with a Parent
Material Adverse Effect on Taxes in a later taxable period. Parent has
delivered or made available to the Company true and complete copies of
federal, state and local income Tax Returns of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2002,
2003 and promptly upon their availability, 2004, and true and complete copies
of all examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by any of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor, with
respect to Taxes. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, or has made
any request in writing for any such extension or waiver.    44   (e) Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other
third party, and all Tax Returns (including without limitation all IRS Forms
W-2 and 1099) required with respect thereto have been properly completed and
timely filed in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has classified any individual as an "independent contractor" or
similar non-employee status who, according to any Parent Benefit Plan or
applicable Law, should have been classified as an employee.   (f) There are
no Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including indemnity
arrangements) with respect to or involving any of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and, after the Closing Date, none of Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements or have any Liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.   (g) Except for the
affiliated group of which Parent is the common parent, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is not and has never been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or any group that
has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has Liability for the Taxes of any Person (including
an individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, labor union
or other entity or Governmental Entity) other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor,
(iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.   (h) Parent has not constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
the Code (i) in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement, or
(ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) that includes the Merger.   (i) Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (j) None of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (i) has consented at any time under former Section 341(f)(1) of
the Code to have the provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply
to any disposition of the assets of Parent (or under any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law); (ii) has agreed, or is or was required, to make

delivery of this Agreement or any other related agreement, the consummation

have or could reasonably be expected to result in an action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any Governmental
Entity. To Parent\'s knowledge, as of the date hereof, no employees of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries are in any material respect in violation of any
term of any employment Contract, non-disclosure agreement, noncompetition

right of any such employee to be employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or presently
proposed to be conducted by Parent or such Subsidiary or to the use of trade
secrets or proprietary information of others. As of the date hereof, no
employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, at the officer level or above,
has given notice to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that any such employee
intends to terminate his or her employment with Parent or any of its

Agreement or any other related agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the stockholder approval of
the Merger (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) (x) result in any payment (including, without

Affiliates under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise, (y) significantly

obligating such Person to assign to Parent or such Subsidiary all of his or
her right, title and interest in any such invention, technology or work of

operation of law, and all of its employees have assigned to Parent or such
Subsidiary the rights to such contributions that Parent or such Subsidiary

adverse effect on a Parent Key Product. All employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with access to material confidential information of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, which information relates to a Parent Key Product,
are parties to written agreements under which, among other things, each such
employee is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of confidential
information of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the absence of
such written agreements would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on any Parent Key Product. To the knowledge of Parent as of
the date hereof, no employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are in
violation thereof.   (o) The execution, delivery and performance of this

rent under such Parent Lease; (iv) the other party to such Parent Lease is
not an Affiliate of, and otherwise does not have any economic interest in,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) neither Parent nor any of its

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) All material
reports, documents, claims and notices required to be filed, maintained, or
furnished to the FDA or any Governmental Entity by Parent, its Subsidiaries,

aware of any facts which are reasonably likely to cause (1) the recall,
market withdrawal or replacement of any product sold or intended to be sold
by Parent or its Subsidiaries; (2) a change in the marketing classification
or a material change in labeling of any such products, or (3) a termination
or suspension of marketing of any such products.   (h) Parent and its
Subsidiaries are and at all times have been in material compliance with
federal or state criminal or civil laws (including without limitation the
federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b)), Stark Law (42
U.S.C. Section 1395nn), False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. Section 3729 et seq.),

104-191), and any comparable state laws), or the regulations promulgated
pursuant to such Laws, or which are cause for civil penalties or mandatory or
permissive exclusion from any Program. There is no civil,
criminal, administrative or other action, suit, demand, claim, hearing,
investigation, proceeding, notice or demand pending, received or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
which could reasonably result in its exclusion from participation in any
Program or other third party payment programs in which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries participates.   (i) To Parent\'s knowledge, Parent and each
Subsidiary are and have been in substantial compliance with all applicable
Laws and regulations related to 21 C.F.R. Part 11 compliance. Parent and each

ensure compliance with all requirements of 21 C.F.R. Part 11, including those

and failures associated with the use of electronic records and electronic
signatures; and (iii) to train and educate its new and current employees as

material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to which Parent or
its Subsidiaries is a party or is a beneficiary or named insured. Parent and
its Subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurers in such
amounts and covering such risks as are appropriate and reasonable,
considering Parent\'s and its Subsidiaries\' properties, business and
operations.   (b) Excluding insurance policies that have expired and been
replaced in the ordinary course of business, as of the date of this
Agreement, to Parent\'s knowledge, no threat in writing has been made to
cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any such
insurance policy of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent during the period of
one year prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, to Parent\'s
knowledge, no event has occurred, including the failure by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent to give any notice or information or by giving any
inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or
impairs the rights of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent under any such
excess Liability or protection and indemnity insurance policies.   Section

Bank Securities, Inc. and Thomas Weisel Partners LLC (the "PARENT FINANCIAL

view, to Parent.   Section 4.21. Brokers and Finders. Parent and its
Subsidiaries have not entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding
with any Person or firm which may result in the obligation of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to pay any investment banking fees, finder\'s fees, or
brokerage commissions in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than fees payable to the Parent Financial Advisors. Parent has
delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the engagement letter
between Parent and the Parent Financial Advisors.   Section 4.22. Foreign
Corrupt Practices and International Trade Sanctions. To Parent\'s knowledge,
neither Parent, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees or any other Persons acting on their
behalf has, in connection with the operation of their respective businesses,
(i) used any corporate or other funds for unlawful contributions, payments,
gifts or entertainment, or made any unlawful expenditures relating to

financing commitment letter, dated March 20, 2005, from Deutsche Bank
Securities, Inc. and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas to Parent, as in
effect on the date hereof (the "FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER"), has been

or negotiations with the  Company Potential Acquiror with respect to such
Company Acquisition  Proposal.   (c) As promptly as practicable (and, in
any event, within 48 hours) after receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide
Parent with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the
Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
and a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such Company
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. After receipt of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company shall promptly keep
Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments) of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent
a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in connection with such
Company Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.   (d) For a period of not
less than five (5) Business Days after Parent\'s receipt of each Company
Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the
Company Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Company Superior Proposal no
longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal (a "FORMER COMPANY SUPERIOR
PROPOSAL"). The terms and conditions of this Section 5.03 shall again apply
to any inquiry or proposal made by any Person who withdraws or materially
amends a Company Superior Proposal or who made a Former Company Superior
Proposal (after withdrawal or after such time as their proposal is a Former
Company Superior Proposal).   (e) Neither the Company\'s Board of Directors
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the
Company\'s Board of Directors of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
similar Contract relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve

Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company\'s Board of Directors or any committee thereof
may take any or all of the actions described in (i) and (iii) above (in each
case, a "COMPANY CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION") if, prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval:   (w) The Company\'s Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;   (x) The
Company\'s Board of Directors has notified Parent in writing of the
determination described in clause (w) above; and   (y) in the case of any
such actions taken in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal, at
least five (5) Business Days following receipt by Parent of the notice
required pursuant to clause (x) above, and taking into account any revised
proposal made    65  by Parent since receipt of such notice, the
Company\'s Board of Directors maintains its determination described in clause
(w) above.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of a Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the
Company Superior Proposal) or by a Company Change of Recommendation. The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders a Company
Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so, prior to termination of this
Agreement.   (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the
Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall not effect a Company Change of Recommendation unless
specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 5.03(e).   Section
5.04. No Solicitation by Parent.   (a) After the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers, directors or employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Parent Acquisition Proposal (except to disclose the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.04), or (iii) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any Contract (whether binding or not) contemplating or
otherwise relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent and its
Subsidiaries and their officers, directors and employees will immediately
cease, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to cease, any and all existing discussions or negotiations
with a Person with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall as
soon as practicable demand that each Person which has within the 12 months
prior to the date of this Agreement executed a confidentiality agreement with
Parent or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives with respect to such Person\'s consideration of a possible
Parent Acquisition Transaction to immediately return or destroy (which
destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to Parent) all
confidential information heretofore furnished by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to such
Person or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.04(a),
Parent may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Parent
Acquisition Proposal from a Person (a "PARENT POTENTIAL ACQUIROR") which
Parent\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with a nationally recognized, independent financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Parent
Superior Proposal, take the    66  following actions; provided, that (x)
Parent has first given the Company written notice that states that Parent has
received such Parent Acquisition Proposal and otherwise includes the
information required by Section 5.04(c) (a "PARENT SUPERIOR PROPOSAL
NOTICE"), and (y) such Parent Acquisition Proposal was not solicited after
the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 5.04:   (i) furnish information to the Parent
Potential Acquiror; provided  that (A) prior to furnishing any such
information, Parent receives from the  Parent Potential Acquiror a Competing
Confidentiality Agreement; provided,  however, that such Competing
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be required  to contain standstill
provisions; provided, further, that if any Competing  Confidentiality
Agreement does not contain a standstill provision or  contains a standstill
provision that is more favorable to the other party  thereto than the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality  Agreement shall
automatically, and without any further action of the  parties, be amended to
delete (in the case where the Competing  Confidentiality Agreement does not
contain a standstill provision) or  amended to restate (in the case where the
Competing Confidentiality  Agreement contains a standstill agreement with
terms more favorable to the  other party thereto than the standstill
provisions set forth in the  Confidentiality Agreement) the standstill
provision in the Confidentiality  Agreement to make the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement relating to the  standstill consistent with the
more favorable terms of the Competing  Confidentiality Agreement, and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any  such nonpublic information to the
Parent Potential Acquiror, Parent  furnishes such nonpublic information to
the Company (or, with respect to any  such nonpublic information that has
previously been furnished to the Company  or its Representatives, a list
identifying such nonpublic information  delivered to the Company and its
Representatives); and   (ii) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with the  Parent Potential Acquiror with respect to the Parent
Acquisition Proposal.   (c) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) after receipt of a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
request for nonpublic information or inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent shall provide the
Company with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the
Person or group making such Parent Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
and a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. After receipt of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, Parent shall promptly keep the
Company informed in all material respects of the status and details
(including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to
the Company a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in
connection with such Parent Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.   (d)
For a period of not less than five (5) Business Days after the Company\'s
receipt of each Parent Superior Proposal Notice, Parent shall, if requested
by the Company, negotiate in good faith with the Company to revise this
Agreement so that the Parent Acquisition Proposal that constituted a
Parent Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Parent Superior   
67  Proposal (a "FORMER PARENT SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"). The terms and conditions
of this Section 5.04 shall again apply to any inquiry or proposal made by any
Person who withdraws or materially amends a Parent Superior Proposal or who
made a Former Parent Superior Proposal (after withdrawal or after such time
as their proposal is a Former Parent Superior Proposal).   (e) Neither
Parent\'s Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company or Merger Sub, or publicly propose
to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company or Merger Sub, the
approval or recommendation by Parent\'s Board of Directors of the Share
Issuance, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar Contract relating to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent\'s Board of Directors or
any committee thereof may take any or all of the actions described in (i) and
(iii) above (in each case, a "PARENT CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION") if, prior to
receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval:   (w) Parent\'s Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;   (x) Parent\'s Board of Directors has notified the Company in
writing of the determination described in clause (w) above; and   (y) in
the case of any such actions taken in connection with a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, at least five (5) Business Days following receipt by Company of the
notice required pursuant to clause (x) above, and taking into account any
revised proposal made by the Company since receipt of such notice, Parent\'s
Board of Directors maintains its determination described in clause
(w) above.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of
a Parent Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Parent Superior Proposal) or
by a Parent Change of Recommendation. Parent shall not submit to the vote of
its stockholders a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so, prior
to termination of this Agreement.   (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
Parent\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall not effect a Parent Change of Recommendation unless specifically
permitted pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(e).   Section 5.05. Access
to Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall each
afford to the other and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time to their respective officers, employees, Representatives,
properties, books,    68  contracts, commitments, files and records and,
during such period, shall furnish promptly such information concerning its
businesses, properties and personnel as the other party shall reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall
be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may
not provide to the other party by reason of Contractual or legal
restrictions, including applicable Laws, or which it believes is
competitively sensitive information, but shall use its best efforts to obtain
a consent to disclosure of such information. In addition, each party may
designate any competitively sensitive information provided to the other under
this Agreement as "outside counsel only." Such information shall be
given only to outside counsel of the recipient. Each party will use
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the
other party and its Subsidiaries which may result from the requests for
access, data and information hereunder.   (b) Each of Parent and the
Company also will consult with the other party regarding its business in a
prompt manner and on a regular basis. The Company and its officers and
employees shall notify Parent of, and keep Parent informed of all material
information regarding, any meeting or discussion with the FDA regarding
product approvals of the Company. Parent and its officers and employees shall
notify the Company of, and keep the Company informed of all material
information regarding, any meeting or discussion with the FDA
regarding product approvals of Parent.   (c) All nonpublic information
provided to, or obtained by, a party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be "Proprietary Information" for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated November 17, 2004 between Parent and the
Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of which shall continue
in force until the Effective Time; provided that Parent and the Company may
disclose such information as may be necessary in connection with seeking the
Parent Required Statutory Approvals, the Company Required Statutory
Approvals, the Company Stockholder Approval and the Parent
Stockholder Approval.   (d) In addition, without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, provide Parent
with sufficient advance notice of intended written or electronic
communications with the SEC regarding the investigation referred to in "Other
Matters--Government Inquiry" under Item 3 of the Company 10-K (the
"INVESTIGATION") to allow Parent to review and comment upon such
communications, (ii) promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any
communications (written or oral) from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff for additional information related to
the Investigation, and, with respect to the Investigation, shall supply
Parent with (A) full, complete and accurate copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC or its staff,
and all information provided by the Company to the SEC or its staff, and (B)
a full, accurate and complete description of all oral communications between
the Company or any of its Representatives and the SEC or its staff, (iii)
furnish Parent with all non-privileged information, files and records
concerning and related to the Investigation as Parent may reasonably request,
(iv) afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
Company\'s officers, employees and Representatives concerning the
Investigation, and (v) keep Parent fully informed of all material information
and developments regarding the Investigation. The Company shall consider in
good faith the views and comments of Parent and its Representatives with
respect to all communications and disclosure made to the SEC or its staff and
other actions taken relating to    69  the Investigation. The Company may
designate any competitively sensitive information provided to Parent under
this Agreement as "outside counsel only."   Section 5.06. Employee
Benefits.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Company Benefit Plans in
effect as of the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect
to employees of the Company (or their Subsidiaries), covered by such plans at
the Effective Time until such time as Parent shall, subject to applicable
Law, the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such plans, adopt new
benefit plans with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "NEW BENEFIT PLANS"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing Company
Benefit Plans with a view towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans
for the employees covered thereby. At such time as any New Benefit Plans are
implemented, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, with respect to
all New Benefit Plans, (i) provide each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with service or other credit for all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries under any New Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan
that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, to the extent that such employee would receive credit for
such conditions under the corresponding welfare plan in which any such
employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan that
such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, (iii)
provide each employee with credit for all service for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for benefit accruals under
any defined benefit pension plan) with the Company and its Subsidiaries,
under each employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which such employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, and (iv) provide benefits under medical, dental, vision and
similar health and welfare plans that are in the aggregate no less favorable
than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that in no event shall the employees be
entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 5.06, Parent shall have no obligation to
provide any credit for service, co-payments, deductibles paid, or for any
purpose, unless and until Parent has received such supporting documentation
as Parent may reasonably deem to be necessary in order to verify the
appropriate credit to be provided.   (b) If requested by Parent at least
seven (7) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any
and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code, effective not later than the last business day immediately preceding
the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k)
plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the
Company\'s Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time.    70   (c) The foregoing notwithstanding,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with
their terms all benefits accrued through the Effective Time under Company
Benefit Plans or under other contracts, arrangements, commitments, or
understandings described in the Company Disclosure Letter.   (d) Unless
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, the Company shall terminate the
Company ESPP in accordance with Section 2.07.   (e) Nothing in this Section
5.06 shall be interpreted as preventing Parent from amending, modifying or
terminating any of the Company Benefit Plans, or other contracts,
arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with their terms
and applicable Law.   Section 5.07. Registration Statement; Joint Proxy
Statement; Stockholder Meetings; Listing of Shares.   (a) As soon as is
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC proxy materials which shall
constitute the Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Registration Statement (in which the Joint Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent shall take all
commercially reasonable actions required to be taken under any applicable
state blue sky or securities Laws in connection with the Share Issuance. Each
party hereto shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of
its capital stock as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with such actions. The parties shall notify each other promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information, and
shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence between such or any
of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement or the Merger.   (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Parent Stockholder Approval or the Company Stockholder Approval, any event
occurs with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any change
occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, which
is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and, as required by
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to Parent\'s or the Company\'s stockholders.    71   (c) If,
at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval or the
Company Stockholder Approval, any event occurs with respect to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment
of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such event, and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and, as required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to Parent\'s or the
Company\'s stockholders.   (d) The Company will, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, duly take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, which
meeting shall be a special meeting of the Company\'s stockholders. In
connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company will (i) subject to the fiduciary duties of
its Board of Directors, use its commercially reasonable best efforts
(including postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders\' Meeting to
solicit additional proxies) to obtain the necessary approvals by its
stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. Subject to Section 5.03(e),
the Joint Proxy Statement shall contain the unqualified recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors that its stockholders vote in favor of
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.   (e) Parent
will, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval. In connection with the Parent Stockholders\'
Meeting and the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent will (i) subject to
the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts (including postponing or adjourning the
Parent Stockholders\' Meeting to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the
necessary approvals by its stockholders of the Share Issuance and (ii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting. Subject to Section 5.04(e), the Joint Proxy Statement
shall contain the unqualified recommendation of Parent\'s Board of Directors
that its stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance.   (f) Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of converted Company
Stock Options to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance.   Section 5.08. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the
Effective Time: (i) Parent\'s Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee
of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer

unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that each of Parent and
the Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions
by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not

withdrawn, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent 
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) as 
a result of a breach of a covenant or other affirmative obligation, and 
(iii) within 12 months after the date of termination of this Agreement, the 
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company 
Acquisition    73   Transaction or consummates a Company Acquisition
Transaction, then the  Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer of same-
day funds $90,000,000  (the "COMPANY TERMINATION FEE"), less any amount paid
by the Company to  Parent pursuant to Section 5.10(b)(i) at the earlier of
the date the Company  enters into a definitive agreement providing for a
Company Acquisition  Transaction and the date of consummation of such the
Company Acquisition  Transaction. Solely for the purposes of this Section
5.10(b)(ii), the term  "Company Acquisition Transaction" shall have the

pursuant to Section 7.01(d),  then Parent shall pay the Company $10,000,000
within two (2) Business Days  following termination by wire transfer of same-

pay the Company  $16,500,000 within two (2) Business Days following
termination by wire  transfer of same-day funds to an account specified in
writing by the  Company.   (ii) If (i) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Parent  Stockholders\' Meeting, any Person publicly announces a
Parent Acquisition  Proposal which has not been expressly and bona fide
publicly withdrawn, (ii)  this Agreement is terminated by either the Company
or Parent pursuant to  Section 7.01(b)(iv) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(d) as a  result of a breach of a covenant or other affirmative
obligation, and (iii)  within 12 months after the date of termination of this
Agreement, Parent  enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Parent Acquisition  Transaction or consummates a Parent Acquisition
Transaction, then Parent  shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of same-

by Parent to the Company  pursuant to Section 5.10(c)(i) or 5.10(c)(iv), at
the earlier of the date  Parent enters into a definitive agreement providing

conditions to consummation of the  Merger are satisfied or capable of then
being satisfied and the sole reason  that the Merger has not been consummated
on or prior to the date of such  termination is that one or more conditions
set forth in Section 6.01(b) or  Section 6.01(c) has not been satisfied due
to the failure to obtain the  necessary consents and approvals under
Antitrust Laws or a judgment,  injunction, order or decree of a Governmental
Entity of competent  jurisdiction shall be in effect (including the effects
of any such failure  or acts) and such judgment, injunction, order or decree
was issued under  Antitrust Laws, then Parent shall pay the Company
$10,000,000 within two (2)  Business Days following termination by wire
transfer of same-day funds to an  account specified in writing by the
Company; provided, however, that the  Company shall not be entitled to such
fee if, prior to or at the time of  termination, (A) Parent is entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 7.01(c) (excluding the notice
provisions contained therein) or (B)  the Company is in breach of its
obligations set forth in Section 5.11 with  respect to Antitrust Laws.  
(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be obligated to  pay the
Company a fee under both Section 5.10(c)(i) and Section 5.10(c)(iv).   (d)
Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Sections 5.10(b) and 5.10(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party (the
"DEFAULTING PARTY") fails promptly to pay the termination fee, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Defaulting Party for the termination fee, the Defaulting
Party shall pay to the other party interest on the termination fee from and
including the date payment of the termination fee was originally due to but
excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate of Bank of
America, National Association in effect on the date such payment was
originally required to be made. If applicable, the termination fee shall not
be payable by a party more than once pursuant to this Section 5.10.  
Section 5.11. Agreement to Cooperate.   (a) The Company and Parent shall
each use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary and
proper under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entity or any other third Person any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained
or made by the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby including,
without limitation, the Merger, and (iii) as promptly as practicable, make
all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or
state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request
thereunder, and (C) any other applicable Law. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings,
including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and
its    75  advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.
Subject to Section 5.05, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) The Company and Parent agree, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for the
Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal,
state or foreign Law or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively "ANTITRUST LAWS"), to obtain the expiration of any applicable
waiting period under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any government requests
for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any
action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Parent
shall have the right to determine and direct the strategy and process by
which the parties will seek required approvals under Antitrust Laws; provided
that Parent will consult with and consider in good faith the views of the
Company in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.11, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to (i) license, divest, dispose of or hold separate any material
assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits in
any material respect its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) agree to or effect any
license, divestiture, disposition or hold separate any business or take any
other action or agree to any limitation that is not conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger. The Company (x) shall not take or agree to take
any action identified in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence without the prior written consent of Parent and (y) if so requested
by Parent, shall use reasonable best efforts to effect any license,
divestiture, disposition or hold separate of any of the Company\'s assets or
businesses necessary to obtain clearances or approvals required for the
Closing under the Antitrust Laws, provided that such action is conditioned on
the consummation of the Merger.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall
give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to
third Persons, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
reasonable efforts to obtain any third Person consents related to or required
in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the Parent Disclosure Letter or the Company Disclosure Letter, as the case
may be, or (iii) required to prevent a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the
Effective Time. If any party shall fail to obtain any consent from a third
Person described in this subsection (c), such party will use its reasonable
efforts, and will take any such actions reasonably requested by the other
party hereto, to limit the adverse affect upon the Company and Parent, their
respective    76  Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses
resulting, or that could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective
Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.   (d) Parent and the Company
shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) advise the other orally
and in writing of any state of facts, event, change, effect, development,
condition or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect, respectively. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate
in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so
qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.  
Section 5.12. Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification.   (a) Parent
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor all of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
obligations to indemnify the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any person who becomes an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for acts or omissions by
such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, whether
pursuant to the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s Certification
of Incorporation, bylaws, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and
such obligations shall survive the Merger. For a period of six years
following the Effective Time, the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall contain, and
Parent shall cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to contain, provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification and exculpation of such
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company\'s and its
Subsidiary\'s Certification of Incorporation and bylaws.   (b) For a period
of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company; provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or
events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
200% amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"); provided, further, if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium; provided, further, if Parent
in its sole discretion elects, by giving written notice to the Company at
least thirty days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing
insurance,    77  effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff"
insurance program for a period of six years after the Effective Time with
respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at
or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate
coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount at least equal to
the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Company\'s existing directors
and officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be with
reputable and financially sound carriers and no less advantageous on the
whole to such existing coverage). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section
5.12(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect. Company represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is as set
forth in Section 5.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (c) In the
event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.12 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.12 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 5.12 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.12).   Section 5.13. Rule 145. The Company shall, promptly after the
date hereof and prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, deliver to
Parent a list setting forth the names of all Persons the Company expects to
be, at the time of the Company\'s Stockholders\' Meeting, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall
furnish such information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for
the purpose of reviewing the list and shall supplement such list to reflect
any Person that later becomes an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an affiliate in the list
furnished or supplemented pursuant to this Section 5.13 to execute a written
agreement, promptly following the date hereof, in substantially the form of
Exhibit A hereto.   Section 5.14. Tax Free Merger.   (a) Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts not to, and not to permit or cause any of its Subsidiaries to, take
any action (including any action otherwise permitted by Section 5.01 in the
case of the Company or Section 5.02 in the case of Parent) that could
reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   
78   (b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable efforts in order for Parent to obtain the
opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP described in Section 6.01(f) and for the
Company to obtain the opinion of Morrison and Foerster LLP described in Section
6.01(g). In connection therewith, both Parent (together with Merger Sub) and
the Company shall deliver to Latham and Watkins LLP and Morrison and Foerster LLP
representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of such opinions,
in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibits B and C,
respectively.   Section 5.15. Stockholder Litigation.   (a) In the event a
stockholder litigation related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby is brought, or threatened, against the Company and/or the
members of the Company\'s Board of Directors, the Company shall have the
right to control the defense of such litigation; provided, however, that the
Company shall engage Morrison and Foerster LLP or such other counsel that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any such stockholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the Company
and/or the members of the Company\'s Board of Directors and shall provide
Parent with updates and such information as Parent shall reasonably request
with respect to the status of the litigation and discussions between
the parties thereto (unless the provision of such updates and information
could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense of and settlement discussions with respect to such litigation and
shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such litigation unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment or settlement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (b) In the event a stockholder litigation related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby is brought, or
threatened, against Parent and/or the members of Parent\'s Board of
Directors, Parent shall have the right to control the defense of such
litigation; provided, however, that Parent shall engage Latham and Watkins LLP
or such other counsel that is reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent
shall promptly notify the Company of any such stockholder litigation brought,
or threatened, against Parent and/or the members of Parent\' Board of
Directors and shall provide the Company with updates and such information as
the Company shall reasonably request with respect to the status of the
litigation and discussions between the parties thereto (unless the provision
of such updates and information could reasonably be expected to result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege). Parent shall give the Company
the opportunity to participate in the defense of and settlement discussions
with respect to such litigation and shall not make any payment or settlement
offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such litigation unless
the Company shall have consented in writing in such payment or settlement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   Section 5.16. Control
of Other Party\'s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of any other party prior to the consummation of the   
79  Merger. Prior to the consummation of the Merger, each party shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.   Section 5.17.
Rights Agreements.   (a) The Company covenants and agrees that it will not

terms are defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) is, by virtue of this
Agreement or any action contemplated by this Agreement, an "Acquiring Person"
(as such term is defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) for purposes of the
Parent Rights Agreement. Parent shall not adopt a new stockholder rights plan
or "poison pill."   Section 5.18. Board of Directors. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall take all action
necessary so that, effective immediately following the Effective Time, (i)
Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D., Nicholas L. Teti, Joy A. Amundson (or, in the
event that Ms. Amundson is unable to serve as a director, such other current

serve as a director, such other current director of the Company selected by
the nominating committee of Parent\'s Board of Directors). Certain management
designations anticipated by the parties to be effected at the Effective Time
are set forth on Schedule 5.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter.   Section
5.19. Financing.   (a) Without limiting Sections 5.05 or 5.11, the Company
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Subsidiaries of the Company and the
respective officers, employees and independent auditors of the Company and
the subsidiaries of the Company to provide, cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of any financing to be consummated in order to fund the Cash
Merger Consideration to be paid    80  pursuant to this Agreement (each,
a "FINANCING"), including without limitation, reasonable participation in
meetings and road shows; the provision of information relating to the
Financing reasonably requested by Parent; and reasonable assistance in the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses
and similar documents of Parent. Notwithstanding this Section 5.19(a), the
Company shall not be required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide to another party by reason of Contractual or
legal restrictions, including applicable Laws, or which it believes is
competitively sensitive information, but shall use its best efforts to obtain
a consent to disclosure of such information. In addition, the Company may
designate any competitively sensitive information provided to the other under
this Section 5.19(a) as "outside counsel only." Such information shall be
given only to outside counsel of the recipient. Parent will use reasonable
best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries which may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder.   (b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall obtain all
financing required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
Financing shall, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, be on reasonable
terms. Parent acknowledges that, notwithstanding any conditions stated in the
Financing Commitment Letter, Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations to have
sufficient funds and sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Parent
Common Stock to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not conditioned upon the consummation of any
Financing.   (c) Without limiting Section 5.05, Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of any contemplated or proposed
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (i)

Financing Commitment Letter or any other commitment letter or definitive
agreements entered into in relation to a Financing has not been satisfied or
cannot be satisfied at the time such condition is required to be satisfied,
and (iv) discuss with the Company at the Company\'s reasonable request the
status of any contemplated or proposed Financing.   Section 5.20. Further

Agreement by the stockholders of the Company and/or Parent):   (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b) by either Parent or
the Company:   (i) if the Merger has not been consummated on or before
December 19, 2005 (such date, as it may be extended under clause (A) of this

obtain funds on terms satisfactory to Parent sufficient to pay the full
amount of the Cash Merger Consideration or (z) all other conditions to
consummation of the Merger are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied
and the sole reason that the Merger has not been consummated by such date is
that one or more conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b), Section 6.01(c) or
Section 6.01(d) has not been satisfied due to the failure to obtain the
necessary consents and approvals under Antitrust Laws or a
judgment, injunction, order or decree of a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall be in effect, and Parent or the Company are still
attempting to obtain such necessary consents and approvals under Antitrust
Laws or are contesting the refusal of the relevant Governmental Entity to
give such consents or approvals or the entry of any such judgment,
injunction, order or decree by a Governmental Entity or through other
applicable proceedings, and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose

Section 2.06(b)   Section 8.04. Interpretation. The headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement,
unless a contrary intention appears, (i) the words "herein," "hereof" and
"hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision, and
(ii) reference to any Article or Section means such Article or Section
hereof. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed
against any party hereto solely because such party or its legal
representative drafted such provision. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."   Section 8.05.
Miscellaneous. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise.
The parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (c) agrees that it    98  will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and each of
the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury, (d) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
and (e) each of the parties irrevocably consents to service of process by
first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the
address at which such party is to receive notice. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE
PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW
PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.   Section 8.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may
be executed in two or more counterparts, and by facsimile, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement.   Section 8.07. Amendments; Extensions.   (a) This
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the
Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been
obtained; provided that, after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further
approval by stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders and, after the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by
stockholders of Parent without the further approval of such stockholders.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   (b) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein (except as specifically provided in Sections
6.01(f) and 6.01(g)); provided that after the Company Stockholder Approval
has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by law requires further
approval by stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders and after the Parent Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by law requires further approval
by stockholders of Parent without the further approval of such stockholders.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. The failure or delay of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.   Section 8.08. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter), the letter
agreement (with respect to paragraphs 8 and 9 only) dated as of March 18,
2005 by and among Q-Med AB, Parent and the Company, and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties   
99  with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and oral, between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. No
representation, inducement, promise, understanding, condition or warranty not
set forth herein has been made or relied upon by either party hereto. Neither
this Agreement nor any provision hereof is intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder except for the
provisions of Section 5.12, which are intended for the benefit of the
Company\'s former and present officers and directors and Article I
hereof.   Section 8.09. Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party.   Section 8.10. Specific
Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedies at
law or in equity.   Section 8.11. Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any
section of a party\'s Disclosure Letter shall be considered disclosed for
other sections of such Disclosure Letter, but only to the extent such matter
on its face would reasonably be expected to be pertinent to a particular
section of a party\'s Disclosure Letter in light of the disclosure made in
such section. The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for
disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of
materiality hereunder.   [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]    100   IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by
their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above
written.    MEDICIS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION     By: /s/ Jonah
