-iv-  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of January 16, 2011, by and among Comerica Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (" _Target_ "), a Texas
corporation, and, from and after its accession to this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.11, Sub (as defined herein).

_Preamble_

The respective Boards of Directors of Target, Sub and Buyer are of the opinion
that the transactions described herein are in the best interests of the
Parties to this Agreement and their respective shareholders. This Agreement
provides for the acquisition of Target by Buyer pursuant to the merger of Sub
with and into Target with Target as the surviving corporation. At the
effective time of such Merger, the outstanding shares of the capital stock of
Target shall be converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock
of Buyer (except as provided herein). As a result, shareholders of Target
shall become shareholders of Buyer and Target shall continue to conduct its
business and operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer. The
transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approvals of the
shareholders of Target, applicable regulatory authorities and the satisfaction
of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It is the intention
of the Parties to this Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax
purposes shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 10.1
of this Agreement.

accordance with the TBOC (the " _Effective Time_ "). Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall cause the Effective Time
to occur on the fifth business day following satisfaction or waiver (subject

satisfied or waived at the Closing).

ARTICLE 2

 

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES



     | 2.1 | Conversion of Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 

Subject to the provisions of this Article 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Target, Sub or the
shareholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:

(a) Each share of capital stock of Buyer issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after
the Effective Time.

 

(b) Each share of Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) Each share of Target Common Stock (excluding shares held by any Target
Entity or any Buyer Entity, in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or
as a result of debts previously contracted) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 0.2365 of a
share of Buyer Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), plus cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Buyer Common Stock.



     | 2.2 | Anti-Dilution Provisions. 
---|---|--- 
 

In the event Buyer changes the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with

 



-6-   respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock
dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or
similar recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be
prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately
adjusted.



     | 2.3 | Shares Held by Target or Buyer. 
---|---|--- 

Each of the shares of Target Common Stock held directly by Target, Buyer or
Sub, in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time
and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.



     | 2.4 | Fractional Shares. 
---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Target Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock
(after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the
market value of one share of Buyer Common Stock at the Effective Time. The
market value of one share of Buyer Common Stock at the Effective Time shall be
the closing price of such common stock on the NYSE (as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source
reasonably selected by Buyer) on the last trading day preceding the Effective
Time. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any
other rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.



     | 2.5 | Treatment of Target Stock Awards. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding stock option award granted
under a Target Stock Plan (a " _Target Option_ ") shall be assumed by Buyer
and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock (an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of
Target Common Stock subject to such Target Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; and the per share
exercise price for Target Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of
Target Common Stock at which such Target Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the parties shall effect such conversion (A) with respect to
any Target Option to which Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, in a manner
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (B) in all
events, in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Assumed
Stock Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
expiration date and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the
corresponding Target Options immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including (but not limited to) vesting in full at the Effective Time.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding phantom stock
unit award granted under a Target Stock Plan (" _Target Phantom Unit_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by Buyer and converted into the number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock) determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Target Common Stock underlying or subject to the Target
Phantom Unit, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each share of Buyer
Common Stock delivered under this provision shall be fully vested at the
Effective Time.

 



-7-  (c) Except as otherwise agreed between Buyer and an individual award holder,
with respect to Phantom Unit Awards issued pursuant to TargetÂ’s 2007 Long-
Term Incentive Stock Performance Program, each such award shall be payable at
100% of "target" (as defined in the applicable agreements for such awards),
and settled pursuant to Section (b) above.

(d) The board of directors of Target or a committee of Non-Employee Directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the disposition by the officers and directors of Target of
Target Common Stock, Target Options or other equity securities of Target
pursuant to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act. The board of directors of Buyer or a committee of Non-
Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by the Target Insiders of Buyer
Common Stock or other equity securities of Buyer pursuant to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. For purposes of
this Section 2.5(d), the term " _Target Insiders_ " means those officers and
directors of Target who will become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as insiders of Buyer in conjunction with the
Merger.

 

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deliver to
the participants in each Target Stock Plan an appropriate notice setting
forth such participantÂ’s rights pursuant thereto and the grants subject to
such Target Stock Plan shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 2.5(a) after
giving effect to the Merger), and Buyer shall comply with the terms of each
Target Stock Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and except as set
forth in and subject to the provisions of, such Target Stock Plan, that Target
Options which qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options as of immediately after
the Effective Time, other than as a result of disqualification due to failure
to comply with the limitations related to vesting and exercisability set
forth in Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise of Target Options assumed by it in accordance with this
Section 2.5. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer shall file
a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Buyer
Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements (and maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for
so long as such options remain outstanding.

(f) Target shall terminate its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Target shall, promptly after the date
hereof, take all actions that are necessary to give effect to this Section
2.5(f) such that no options remain outstanding under the ESPP as of the
Effective Time, including terminating the pending offering in progress
promptly after the date hereof and returning all funds contributed to the ESPP
that have not been used to purchase Target Common Stock to the participants
as soon as administratively feasible.



     | 2.6 | Warrants. 
---|---|--- 

The warrants issued by Target (the " _Warrants_ ") pursuant to the Warrant
Agreement, dated June 9, 2010, between Target and American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, LLC shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent warrants to purchase
Target Common Stock and will be converted automatically into warrants to
purchase Buyer Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional share as
provided in the Warrants, and Buyer will assume such Warrants subject to
their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time:

 



-8-  (a) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of
each Warrant will equal the product of (A) the number of shares of Target
Common Stock that were purchasable under such Warrant immediately before the
effective time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-
hundredth (1/100th) of a share; and

(b) the per share exercise price for each Warrant will equal the quotient of
(i) the per share exercise price of such Warrant in effect immediately before
the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-
tenth (1/10th) of a cent.

ARTICLE 3

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 



     | 3.1 | Exchange Procedures. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available to BuyerÂ’s
transfer agent or another exchange agent selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to Target (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for exchange in accordance
with this Section 3.1 the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable and the
aggregate amount of any cash payable for fractional shares pursuant to this
Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer and Target shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (or in the case of the Depository Trust Company on
behalf of "Street" holders, deliver) to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which represented shares of Target Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry Shares
appropriate transmittal materials and instructions (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent). The Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares of Target Common Stock so delivered shall be duly endorsed as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Target Common Stock represented by Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Target,
the consideration provided in Section 2.1 may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such shares are delivered
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such
transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of
that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, mislaid,
stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as Buyer and the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other documents necessary
to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent
shall issue to such holder the consideration into which the shares
represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have
been converted. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and
customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties as it may
deem appropriate. Buyer shall pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the distribution of the
consideration provided in Section 2.1.

 

(b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Target Common Stock
(other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.3) issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing such shares to the Exchange Agent and shall promptly
upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the consideration
provided in Section 2.1, together with all undelivered dividends or
distributions in respect of such shares (without interest thereon) as provided
for herein. Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which
any former holder of Target Common Stock is entitled as a result of the
Merger until such holder surrenders such holderÂ’s Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 3.1.

 

(c) Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of

 



-9-   shares of Target Common Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that any amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the shares of Target Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(d) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of
Target Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



     | 3.2 | Rights of Former Target Shareholders. 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be closed as
to holders of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and
no transfer of Target Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be
made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.1, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share theretofore
representing shares of Target Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 2.3) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in Sections
2.1 and 2.5 in exchange therefor, subject, however, to the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been
declared or made by Target in respect of such shares of Target Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Buyer
on the Buyer Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of
record of Buyer Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share until

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
BuyerÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each Buyer Entity (i) did not, as of the most recent

related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Internal

Entity to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease and desist order,
injunction, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum of
understanding, or to adopt any board resolution or similar undertaking, which
restricts materially the conduct of its business.

Each Buyer Entity complies with all Laws applicable to it or its Assets and to
the operation of its business.



     | 5.10 | Material Contracts.

and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (x) operate its business only in
the usual, regular, and ordinary course, and (y) use its reasonable best
efforts to preserve intact its business organization and Assets and maintain
its rights and franchises; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent
any Buyer Entity from discontinuing or disposing of any of its Assets or
business if such action is, in the judgment of Buyer, desirable in the
conduct of the business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Buyer further covenants
and agrees that it will not do or agree or commit to do, or permit any of its
Subsidiaries to do or agree or commit to do, any of the following without the
prior written consent of Target, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned: (a) amend the Articles of Incorporation,

obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, except as required by applicable Law or this Agreement.

 



     | 6.4 | Reports. 
---|---|--- 

Each Party and its Subsidiaries shall file all reports required to be filed
by it with Regulatory Authorities between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time and shall deliver to the other Party copies of all such reports
promptly after the same are filed. If financial statements are contained in
any such reports filed with the SEC, such financial statements will fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the entity filing such

operations, changes in shareholdersÂ’ equity, and cash flows for the periods
then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial
statements to normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not material).



     | 6.5 | Takeover Laws.

The Parties and their respective boards of directors shall (i) use reasonable
best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

 



-29-   contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

constituting a part thereof (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related
documents) as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30
days from the date of this Agreement. Buyer and Target agree to cooperate,
and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other and
its counsel and its accountants in the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement. Each of Buyer and Target agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing thereof. Buyer also agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Buyer and Target agrees to furnish to the other party all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Buyer, Target or their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Target shall have the right to review and
consult with Buyer regarding the form of, and any characterization of such
information included in, the Registration Statement prior to its being filed
with the SEC. Buyer will advise Target, promptly after Buyer receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of Buyer Common Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement
of the Registration Statement or for additional information.

 

(b) Target shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a ShareholdersÂ’
Meeting, to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the purpose of voting upon

not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Target of any Acquisition Proposal or Change in the Target
Recommendation. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2, Target shall,
through its board of directors, recommend to its shareholders the approval and
adoption of this Agreement (the " _Target Recommendation_ ") and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Target Shareholder Approval.
Notwithstanding any Change in the Target Recommendation, this Agreement shall
be submitted to the shareholders of Target at the ShareholdersÂ’ Meeting for
the purpose of obtaining the Target Shareholder Approval and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Target of such
obligation.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.2, neither the board of directors of
Target nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the
Target Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement,
filing or release inconsistent with the Target Recommendation (any of the
foregoing being a " _Change in the Target Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, Target may not effect a Change in the Target
Recommendation unless it has complied in all material respects with the
provisions of Section 7.2(d).

 



-30-       | 7.2 | Acquisition Proposals. 
---|---|--- 

(a) No Target Entity shall, and each Target Entity shall cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, knowingly facilitate (including by way of providing information)
or induce any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the making or
completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person or "Group" (as such term is defined in
Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) any confidential or nonpublic
information with respect to or in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement
related thereto (other than any confidentiality agreement required by Section
7.2(b)), (v) enter into any agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to
any Acquisition Transaction (other than any confidentiality agreement required
by Section 7.2(b)), or (vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.2(a), if Target or
any of its Representatives receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by any Person or "Group" (as such term is defined in
Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) at any time prior to the Shareholders
Meeting that the board of directors of Target has determined, in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with TargetÂ’s financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) to constitute or to be reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, Target and its Representatives may take any
action described in Section 7.2(a)(ii) above to the extent that the board of
directors of Target has determined, in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with TargetÂ’s outside legal counsel), that the failure to take
such action would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that, prior to providing (or causing to be provided) any
confidential or nonpublic information or data permitted to be provided
pursuant to this sentence, Target has obtained from such Person or "Group" an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to
Target than, the terms of the Target Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, Target shall advise Buyer in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, shall promptly provide to Buyer a
written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry (including the identity of the Person or "Group" (as such term
is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) making the Acquisition
Proposal and shall keep Buyer promptly apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations (including providing Parent with a copy of all
material documentation and correspondence relating thereto) on a current
basis. Target agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Buyer any
confidential or nonpublic information concerning Target that may be provided
(pursuant to Section 7.2(b)) to any other Person or "Group" in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to Buyer.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
ShareholdersÂ’ Meeting, if Target has received a Superior Proposal (after
giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 7.2(d)), the board of directors of Target may, in connection with such
Superior Proposal, make a Change in the Target Recommendation, if and only to
the extent that the board of directors of Target has determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



-31-    _provided_ , that the board of directors of Target may not effect a Change
in the Target Recommendation unless:

 

(i) Target shall have received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal and the board of directors of Target shall have concluded in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, after taking into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement agreed to by Buyer;

 

(ii) Target shall have provided prior written notice to Buyer at least three
(3) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Buyer that the board of directors of Target has
received a Superior Proposal, specify the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or "Group" (as
such term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) making the
Superior Proposal);

(iii) during the Notice Period, Target shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Buyer in good faith (to the
extent Buyer desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(iv) the board of directors of Target shall have concluded in good faith that,
after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications offered or agreed to by Buyer, if any,
that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and such revisions are material, Target shall deliver a new written notice to
Buyer and shall comply with the requirements of this Section 7.2(d) with
respect to such new written notice, except that the new Notice Period shall
be two (2) calendar days. In the event the board of directors of Target does
not make the determination referred to in clause (iv) of this paragraph and
thereafter seeks to effect a Change in the Target Recommendation, the
procedures referred to above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any
subsequent Change in the Target Recommendation.

(e) Target and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith; and (iii) not terminate, waive, amend,
release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal to which it or any Target Entity or
Representative is a party, and enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Target or its board of
directors from issuing as "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from
making any disclosure to Target shareholders if TargetÂ’s board of directors
(after consultation with outside counsel) concludes that its failure to do so
would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.



     | 7.3 | Exchange Listing. 
---|---|--- 

Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of Buyer

-32-   Target Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Buyer shall give all notices
and make all filings with the NYSE required in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein.

 



     | 7.4 | Consents of Regulatory Authorities. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Buyer and Target and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of Regulatory Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with
respect to the Merger under any applicable Law, regulation or decree,
including agreeing to divest any assets, deposits, lines of business or
branches. Each of Buyer and Target shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to, all material written information submitted to any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Regulatory
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party will keep the other Party apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including advising the other Party upon receiving any
communication from a Regulatory Authority the consent or approval of which is
required for the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or approval from
a Governmental Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such
consent or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory Communication_
"). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the scope
of the foregoing paragraphs, each Party shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law (i) promptly advise the other Party of the receipt of any
substantive communication from a Regulatory Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any response
thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission or
communication prior to the filing or submission thereof, and (iii) provide the
other Party with the opportunity to participate in any meetings or
substantive telephone conversations that such Party or its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives may have from time to time with any
Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.



     | 7.5 | Investigation and Confidentiality. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall permit the other Party to
make or cause to be made such investigation of the business and properties of
it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and legal
conditions as the other Party reasonably requests, provided that such
investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal operations.
No investigation by a Party shall affect the ability of such Party to rely on
the representations and warranties of the other Party.

 



-33-  (b) All information obtained by the Parties pursuant to this Section shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements.



     | 7.6 | Press Releases. 
---|---|--- 

Target and Buyer agree that no press release or other public disclosure
related to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby shall
be issued by either Party (or its Affiliates) without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , that nothing in this Section shall be
deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other public
disclosure required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States
or non United States securities exchange, in which case the Party required to
make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in
advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a
joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.



     | 7.7 | Tax Treatment. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and to take
no action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from so
qualifying. The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order to obtain the Tax opinions of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz,
counsel to Buyer, and DLA Piper LLP (US), counsel to Target, described in
Sections 8.2(d) and 8.3(d), respectively. The Parties adopt this Agreement as
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

 

(b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of Buyer, Sub and
Target shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any
inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.



     | 7.8 | Employee Benefits and Contracts. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer shall provide generally to officers and employees of the Target Entities
as of the Effective Time (" _Affected Employees_ ") employee benefits under
employee benefit and welfare plans (other than any frozen or grandfathered
plans, which includes the Buyer EntitiesÂ’ defined benefit pension plans and
retiree medical plans), on terms and conditions which when taken as a whole
are substantially similar to those currently provided by the Buyer Entities to
their similarly situated officers and employees; _provided_ , that until such
time as Buyer shall cause Affected Employees to participate in the applicable
benefit plans of the Buyer Entities, an Affected EmployeeÂ’s continued
participation in the benefit plans of the Target Entities shall be deemed to
satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood
that participation in the Buyer plans may commence at different times with
respect to each Buyer plan); _provided_ , further, that, for a period of 12
months after the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide generally to Affected
Employees (other than any such officers or employees who are party to an
individual agreement that provides for severance benefits) severance benefits
in accordance with the severance policy of Target as disclosed in Section 7.8
of its Disclosure Memorandum. For purposes of participation, vesting and
benefit accrual under BuyerÂ’s employee benefit plans, the service of the
Affected Employees prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service
with a Buyer Entity participating in such employee benefit plans to the same
extent each such Affected Employee was entitled to service credit under a
similar Target Benefit Plan; _provided_ that such service credit shall not be
provided (x) under any defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical plans
or programs of Buyer

 



-34-   and its Affiliates or with respect to the level of allocations to any
retirement plans of Buyer and its Affiliates, (y) if it would result in a
duplication of benefits or (z) with respect to any frozen or grandfathered
Employee Benefit Plan of Buyer or its Affiliates or newly established Employee
Benefit Plans of Buyer or its Affiliates that do not provide credit for past
service to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliates.

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor
the obligations of Target and its Subsidiaries under all employment,
severance, consulting, retirement and other compensation Contracts disclosed
in Section 7.8(b) of its Disclosure Memorandum between any Target Entity and
any current or former director, officer or employee thereof, and all
provisions for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or accrued
through the Effective Time under the Target Benefit Plans, in accordance with
their terms; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining the "highest
annual bonus amount" (or other term, provision or concept of similar import)
during the relevant look back period in such Contracts, Buyer agrees that it
shall take into account all bonuses paid by Target or its Subsidiaries to the
relevant officer or employee since January 1, 2008 when making such
determination. Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Merger shall constitute a
"change in control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance with the
provisions of the employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other
compensation Contracts of Target and the other Target Benefit Plans. Except as
set forth in this Section 7.8, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, after consummation of the Merger to, pay all amounts provided
under such Target Benefit Plans and Contracts as a result of a change in
control of Target, as applicable, in accordance with their respective terms,
and to honor all rights and privileges under any such Target Benefit Plans
which become effective as a result of such change in control.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Buyer in writing in advance
of the Effective Time, Target shall take all necessary action, including the
adoption of resolutions and/or plan amendments, to terminate the Target
401(k) Plan effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Buyer makes
such a request to terminate the Target 401(k) Plan, Target shall provide Buyer
with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing that the
Target 401(k) Plan has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.8, the provisions of this
Section 7.8 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and no
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor or any
other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an amendment to any Target Benefit Plan or other Employee Benefit
Plan for any purpose. No provision of this Agreement shall create any right
in any employee or officer of a Target Entity to continued employment by any
Buyer Entity, including Surviving Corporation, or preclude the ability of any
Buyer Entity, including Surviving Corporation, to terminate the employment of
any employee or officer for any reason.



     | 7.9 | Indemnification. 
---|---|--- 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Target
Entities (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising
out of actions or omissions arising out of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s service or
services as directors, officers, employees or agents of Target or, at
TargetÂ’s request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted
under state Law and by TargetÂ’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation, and whether or not any 

 



-35-   Buyer Entity is insured against any such matter. Without limiting the
foregoing, in any case in which approval by the Surviving Corporation is
required to effectuate any indemnification, the Surviving Corporation shall
direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of
any such approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between Buyer and the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its
reasonable best efforts (and Target shall cooperate prior to the Effective
Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect for a period of six years after
the Effective Time TargetÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy (provided that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous
or (ii) with the consent of Target given prior to the Effective Time, any
other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently
covered by such insurance; _provided_ , that neither Buyer nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments for
such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such
policy) which exceed, for the portion related to TargetÂ’s directors and
officers, 350% of the annual premium payments on TargetÂ’s current policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the
amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to
the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Buyer, or Target with the prior

(a) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the
plural, and any plural term the singular. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereby,"
"herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any specific Section.

 



     | 10.3 | Expenses and Fees. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3, each of the Parties
shall bear and pay all direct costs and expenses incurred by it or on its
behalf in connection with the transactions 

 



-49-   contemplated hereunder, including filing, registration and application fees,

printing costs incurred in connection with the printing of the

     | (b) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, if: 
---|---|--- 

(i) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), then Target
shall pay to Buyer in same-day funds immediately upon delivery of the written
notice of termination required by Section 9.1 an amount equal to $40,000,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ "); or

(ii) either Target or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(c) (without the Target shareholders having adopted and approved this
Agreement) or Section 9.1(g), or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(f) (as a result of a volitional breach by Target), and, in any
case, prior to such termination, there has been publicly announced an
Acquisition Proposal, then Target shall pay to Buyer in same-day funds
immediately upon delivery of the written notice of termination required by
Section 9.1 an amount equal to BuyerÂ’s Expenses, not to exceed $3,000,000. If
within twelve months of such termination Target shall either (A) consummate an
Acquisition Transaction or (B) enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Transaction, whether or not such Acquisition
Transaction is subsequently consummated (but changing, in the case of (A) and
(B), the references to the 20% and 80% amounts in the definition
of Acquisition Transaction to 50%), then Target shall pay to Buyer in same-
day funds on or prior to the earlier of the date of consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction or the date of execution of an Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Transaction an amount equal to the
Termination Fee less any amounts previously paid to Buyer by Target pursuant
to this Section 10.3(b)(ii).

The payment by Target of the Termination Fee and/or BuyerÂ’s Expenses pursuant
to this Section 10.3(b) shall be the sole monetary remedy of Buyer in the
event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the bases specified in
this Section 10.3(b) not resulting from a knowing breach of this Agreement by
Target.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in paragraph (b) of
this Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if Target fails to pay promptly any fee payable
by it pursuant to this Section 10.3, then Target shall pay to Buyer, its costs
and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with collecting such
fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was due under this Agreement until
the date of payment.

 



     | 10.4 | Brokers and Finders 
---|---|--- 
 

Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated as to Target and except for
Sandler OÂ’Neill and Partners, L.P. as to Buyer, each of the Parties represents

Affiliates has employed any broker or finder or incurred any Liability for any
financial advisory fees, investment bankersÂ’ fees, brokerage fees,
commissions, or findersÂ’ fees in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event of a claim by any broker or
finder based upon such brokerÂ’s representing or being retained by
or allegedly representing or being retained by Target or by Buyer, each of
Target and Buyer, as the case may be, agrees to indemnify and hold the other
Party harmless of and from any Liability in respect of any such claim.

 



-50-       | 10.5 | Entire Agreement. 
---|---|---

documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder
and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereto,
written or oral (except, as to Section 7.5(b), for the Confidentiality
Agreements). Nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person, other than the Parties or their respective
successors, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than as provided in Sections 7.8 and 7.9.

 



     | 10.6 | Amendments. 
---|---|--- 

To the extent permitted by Law, this Agreement may be amended by a subsequent
writing signed by each of the Parties upon the approval of each of the
Parties, whether before or after shareholder approval of this Agreement has
been obtained; _provided_ , that after any such approval by the holders of
Target Common Stock, there shall be made no amendment that requires further
approval by such shareholders.



     | 10.7 | Waivers. 
---|---|--- 
 

(a) Prior to or at the Effective Time, Buyer, acting through its board of
directors, chief executive officer or other authorized officer, shall have
the right to waive any Default in the performance of any term of this
Agreement by Target, to waive or extend the time for the compliance or
fulfillment by Target of any and all of its obligations under this
Agreement, and to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, except any condition which, if not
satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law. No such waiver shall be
effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of Buyer.

(b) Prior to or at the Effective Time, Target, acting through its board of
directors, chief executive officer or other authorized officer, shall have the
right to waive any Default in the performance of any term of this Agreement by
Buyer or Sub, to waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment
by Buyer or Sub of any and all of its obligations under this Agreement, and
to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Target
under this Agreement, except any condition which, if not satisfied, would
result in the violation of any Law. No such waiver shall be effective unless
in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of Target.

 

(c) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No
waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this
Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.



     | 10.8 | Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. 
---|---|--- 

Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party; _provided_ that, no assignment will be permitted
if such assignment could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in Section

 



-51-   7.9, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in
this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement.
