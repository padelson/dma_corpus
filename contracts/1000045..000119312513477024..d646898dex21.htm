USCo and/or the Purchaser), the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco
hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as
follows, and acknowledge that the Company is relying upon such

securities of the entities identified in Parents Form 10-Q for the period

Portfolio Companies and, as of such date, did not own any securities of any
other entity. Each of the Parent,  

---|---|--- 
 



23 entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent
such concept is legally recognized) under the Applicable Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has full corporate or
other power and authority to own, operate and lease the properties owned or
used by it and to carry on its business as and where such is now being
conducted. Each of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco is duly
licensed or qualified to do business, and is in good standing (to the extent
such concept is legally recognized), in each jurisdiction wherein the
character of the properties owned or leased by it, or the nature of its
business, makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to (i) have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser or US New Opco or
(ii) prevent or materially delay or impede the ability of the Parent, USCo,
the Purchaser and/or US New Opco to perform their or its obligations under
this Agreement or consummate the Arrangement. Each of USCo, the Purchaser and
US New Opco has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the

with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parent owns, directly or
indirectly, all outstanding voting securities and equity securities (or
equivalents) of each of USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco free and clear of

delivered any agreements pursuant to which it made the investments in the
Portfolio Companies (each a "Portfolio Company Agreement"). Except as
otherwise disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents, each Portfolio Company is
current with all its obligations under the applicable Portfolio Company
Agreements, no event of default (or a default which with the giving of notice
or the passage of time would become an event of default) has occurred under
such agreements, except to the extent that any such failure to be current in
its obligations and any such default would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change.  
---|--- 



     | (b) |

_Authority_. Each of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco has all
necessary power, authority and capacity to enter into, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to complete the transactions and
fulfill its obligations contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the completion by the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US
New Opco of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Parent, USCo, the

executed and delivered by each of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New
Opco and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the
Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco enforceable against the Parent,
USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco, as the case may be, in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium and other Applicable Laws relating to or affecting the
availability of equitable remedies and the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity and public policy and to the
qualification that equitable remedies such as specific performance and
injunctive relief may be granted only in the discretion of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

     | (c) | _Capitalization_. The Parent is authorized to issue
500,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock. As of the close of business on

Documents, including any financial statements, schedules or exhibits included
or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such
amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), contained any

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
US GAAP. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Parent has implemented and maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the

it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Parents
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Parent required under the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as defined below) with respect to such reports. To
the knowledge of the Parent, it has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of
this Agreement, to the Parents auditors and the audit committee of the
Parents board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Parents ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Parents internal control over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"
and "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has
arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under
the Exchange Act) of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

for the respective periods set forth therein, subject, in the case of any

balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably
likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on their combined
financial condition, other than those which originate from the Investment

---|---|--- 



     | (i) | which was not solicited after the date of this Agreement;

Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and
the Company is permitted pursuant to this _Section 4.2(d)_ to consider and
participate, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with,
or provide information to, or permit any visit to the properties or
facilities of the Company subject to the execution by such Person of the

---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve the
Company from its obligation to proceed to call and hold the Company Meeting
and to hold a vote of the Shareholders and holders of Options on the
Arrangement Resolution (provided that the Company shall be relieved from its
obligations to actively solicit proxies in favor of the Arrangement
Resolution, if the Company Board determines, in good faith, that soliciting
proxies in favor of the Arrangement Resolution is not consistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws), except in circumstances where this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof prior to the date
of the Company Meeting. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | The Company shall ensure that each of the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (including, without
limitation, the Companys Financial Advisor) retained by any of them are aware
of the provisions of this _Section 4.2_, and it shall be responsible for any
breach of this _Section 4.2_ by such Representatives. 
---|---|--- 



   4.3 | Right to Accept a Superior Proposal 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

If the Company has complied with _Section 4.2_ of this Agreement, the Company
Board may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal and may
withdraw or refrain from affirming the Company Board Recommendation prior to 

---|---|--- 
 



67 only if (with the exception of a confidentiality agreement which complies with
_Section 4.2(d)_, the execution of which shall not be subject to the
conditions of this _Section 4.3_): 
---|--- 



     | (i) | the Company has provided the Purchaser with a copy of the
document containing the Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | ten (10) Business Days have elapsed from the later of: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the date the Purchaser received written notice (a "Superior
Proposal Notice") advising the Purchaser that the Company Board has resolved,
subject to compliance with this _Section 4.3_, to accept, approve, recommend
or enter into an agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the
Person making such Superior Proposal and specifying in detail the basis for
such resolutions; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the date the Purchaser received a copy of the document
containing such Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | a majority of the members of the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Financial Advisor and
outside legal counsel) that failing to take such action would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | taking into account any revised proposal made by the
Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco since receipt of the Superior
Proposal Notice, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the
Company Board has again made the determinations referred to in this _Section
4.3(a)_. 
---|---|--- 

In the event that the Company provides the Purchaser with a Superior Proposal
Notice on a date that is less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Company
Meeting, the Company shall adjourn the Company Meeting to a date that is not
less than five (5) Business Days and not more than fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the Superior Proposal Notice.



     | (b) |

During the ten (10) Business Day period referred to in _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_
above, the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this Agreement,
including the Plan of Arrangement. The Company Board will review any proposal
by the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco to amend the terms of
this Agreement, including the Plan of Arrangement, in good faith in order to
determine whether the amended proposal upon acceptance by the Company would
result in such Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the
Company Board so determines, the Company shall negotiate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into an amended agreement with the Parent, USCo,
the Purchaser and US 

---|---|--- 
 



68  New Opco reflecting the amended proposal. If the Company Board continues to
believe, in good faith and after consultation with the Financial Advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal and therefore rejects the Parents amended proposal, (i) the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and enter into an
agreement regarding the Superior Proposal and/or (ii) the Company Board may
recommend the Superior Proposal and withdraw the Company Board Recommendation.



     | (c) | The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
successive material modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute
a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of _Section 4.2_ and the
requirement under _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_ to initiate an additional five (5)
Business Day notice period. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If the Information Circular has been sent to the
Shareholders prior to the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period set
forth in _Section 4.3(a)(ii)_ and, during such period, the
Purchaser reasonably requests in writing that the Company Meeting proceed,
unless otherwise ordered by the Court, the Company shall continue to take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to hold the Company Meeting and to
cause the Arrangement to be voted on at the Company Meeting.

   7.2 | Effect of Termination 
---|--- 



     | (a) | A Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ above shall deliver written notice of such termination to each
other Party or Parties hereto specifying with particularity the reason
for such termination, and such termination, if valid, will be effective
immediately upon delivery of such written notice. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_ above, it (other than as set forth in
_Section 4.9_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article 8_ , which provisions shall
survive such termination) will become void and of no further force and effect,
with no liability on the part of any Party to this Agreement (or any
Representative of such Party), except that (i) if applicable, the Parent will
be entitled to the Company Termination Fee described in _Section 7.2(b)_
below, and (ii) if applicable, the Company will be entitled to the Purchaser
Termination Fee described in _Section 7.2(c)_ below. 
---|---|--- 
 



83 pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_,
the Company will pay to the Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event, within three (3) Business Days following such termination) by wire
transfer of same day funds the Company Termination Fee, or (B) by the Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or by either Party (as applicable) under 
_Section 7.1(e)_, _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ and, in any of the
foregoing circumstances, if prior to the eighteen month anniversary of such
termination, the Company consummates a transaction contemplated by
an Acquisition Proposal that was received by the Company prior to the
termination of this Agreement, the Company will pay to the Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
following the consummation of such transaction) by wire transfer of same day
funds the Company Termination Fee, and (ii) by the Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, the Company will pay to the Parent as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days following such termination)
by wire transfer of same day funds the Company Termination Fee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than the next
succeeding sentence, the Parents, USCos and the Purchasers right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ above and receive payment
of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco
or any of their Affiliates for monetary damages against the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives, for any and all damages, liabilities, losses,
costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be suffered based upon,
resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with this _Section 7.2(b)_, none of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, shall have any further liability or obligation relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any of the agreements, certificates, or
documents contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the agreements, certificates, or documents contemplated
hereby. In no event shall the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser or US New Opco seek
any money damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, other than the Company
Termination Fee, but the foregoing will not eliminate or limit the right of
the Parent, USCo and Purchaser to seek equitable relief pursuant to the terms
of _Section 7.6(a)_ of this Agreement or seek damages for fraud or willful
breach. In no event will more than one Company Termination Fee be due and
owing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

In the event of termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_, the
Parent will pay to the Company as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days following such termination) by wire
transfer of same day funds the Purchaser Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than the next
succeeding sentence, the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(f)_ above and receive payment of the Purchaser Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c) _  

---|---|--- 
 



84 of its Affiliates against the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser or US New Opco, or
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, for any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be suffered based upon, resulting
from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such termination, and
upon payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee in accordance with this
_Section 7.2(c)_, none of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser or US New Opco, or
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives,
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any of the agreements, certificates, or documents
contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of the agreements, certificates, or documents contemplated hereby. In no
event shall the Company seek any money damages or any other recovery,
judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, other than the Purchaser Termination Fee;  _ _provided__ ,
__however__ , that, subject to _Section 7.6_, the foregoing shall not
eliminate or limit the right of the Company to seek and obtain equitable
relief of any kind or seek damages for fraud or willful breach. In no event
will more than one Purchaser Termination Fee be due and owing. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Termination Fee"
will mean an amount equal to US $6,000,000 and "Purchaser Termination Fee"
will mean an amount equal to US $6,000,000. In the event any Company
Termination Fee, Purchaser Termination Fee or Purchaser Fee is not paid when
due, the Party obligated to pay such amount will additionally pay interest
from such due date at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate"
(as published by the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Each Party acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee and
Purchaser Termination Fee amounts set forth in _Section 7.2(b) and Section
7.2(c)_ above will constitute payment of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Party in question will suffer or
incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant
termination of this Agreement, and is not a penalty. Each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such liquidated
damages are excessive or punitive. 
---|---|--- 



   7.3 | Termination Deadline 
---|--- 

If the Effective Date does not occur on or before the Termination Deadline,
this Agreement will terminate on notice by a Party hereto to the other Parties
hereto. The right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.3_ shall
not be available to any Party hereto whose action or failure to act has been
a substantial cause of or resulted in the failure of the Effective Date to
occur on or before the Termination Deadline and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this
Agreement has not previously been validly terminated in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 7.3_, any Party shall have the right, in their
sole discretion, upon written notice to the other Parties in advance of the 

 



85  Termination Deadline to extend the Termination Deadline for a period of ten
(10) days beyond the Termination Deadline (the "Revised Termination Deadline")
and the other Parties shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 7.3_ until the expiration of such Revised Termination Deadline.



   7.4 | Amendment 
---|--- 

This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time and from time
to time before or after the holding of the Company Meeting but not later than
the Effective Time, be amended by mutual written agreement of all of the
Parties hereto (and not by an email or series of emails, and in the case of
the Parent signed in blue ink by John F. Barry III as Chief Executive Officer
of the Parent or M. Grier Eliasek as Chief Operating Officer of the Parent, or
the successor of either of them, and in the case of the Company signed in blue
ink by Peter L. Vosotas as President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company or Ralph T. Finkenbrink as Senior Vice President  Finance and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, or the successor of either of them), and any
such amendment may, subject to the Interim Order and the Final Order and
Applicable Laws, without limitation:



     | (a) | change the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any of the Parties hereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | waive any inaccuracies or modify any representations or
warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants herein

of the Parties hereto; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | waive compliance with or modify any mutual conditions
precedent herein contained. 
---|---|--- 



   7.5 | Waiver 
---|--- 

At any time prior to the Effective Date, subject to _Section 8.10_, any
Party hereto may:



     | (a) | extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties hereto; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of
the other Parties hereto or with any conditions to its own obligations, but in
each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions
are intended for its benefit. 
---|---|--- 



   7.6 | Remedies 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

The Parties acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages is not
available for certain breaches of this Agreement by the Company or
its Representatives and that such breaches may cause the Parent, USCo, the
Purchaser and US New Opco irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Company 

---|---|--- 
 



86 terminated in accordance with the terms of _Sections 7.1_ or _7.3_ hereof, the
Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco will be entitled to specific
performance by the Company of any affirmative covenant or obligation of the
Company, or an injunction prohibiting any actual or threatened breach by the
Company of any negative or prohibitory covenant or obligation of the Company
(i) under _Section 4.2_ or _Section 4.3_ of this Agreement, or (ii) which
non-performance or breach would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Arrangement pursuant to
this Agreement. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | In the event that the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New
Opco are entitled to specific performance or an injunction pursuant to
_Section 7.6(a)_ of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the Parent, USCo,
the Purchaser and US New Opco have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance or injunction is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Except as set forth in _Section 7.6(a)_ and the preceding
sentence of this _Section 7.6(b)_, the Parties agree that the Parent, USCo,
the Purchaser and US New Opco shall not be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the terms hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Notwithstanding _Section 7.6(a)_, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
Purchasers obligation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to cause the
Purchaser to consummate the Arrangement, only in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in
_Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.3_ (other than those conditions that, by their
terms, are to be satisfied at the Effective Time or the failure of which to be
satisfied, is caused by a material breach by the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser
or US New Opco of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), and (ii) the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US
New Opco fail to complete the Arrangement in accordance with _Article II._
Under no circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the Arrangement being
consummated and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

(d) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the use of electronic
transmission in general, and email in particular, is not necessarily secure
and that there are risks associated with the use thereof, including risks of
interception, disclosure and abuse, and each indicates it assumes and accepts
such risks by hereby authorizing the use of electronic transmission.



   8.2 | Binding Effect 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



   8.3 | No Assignment 
---|--- 

This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other Parties hereto.



   8.4 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement (including the schedules, documents and instruments referred
to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement) constitutes the entire
agreement between the Parties hereto and supersedes all other prior
agreements, negotiations, discussions, understandings and undertakings, both
written and oral, between the Parties hereto relating to the subject matter
hereof. There are no unwritten or oral agreements between the Parties.

 



89 ---|--- 

If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is determined
for any reason and to any extent to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons and
circumstances shall remain in full force and effect, provided that the legal
or economic substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not thereby
affected in a manner adverse to any of the Parties hereto. Should any part of
this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
invalid or unenforceable portion or portions shall be removed (and no more)
only in that jurisdiction, and the remainder shall be enforced as fully as
possible (removing the minimum amount possible) in that jurisdiction. In lieu
of such invalid or unenforceable provision, the Parties hereto will negotiate
in good faith to add automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

 



   8.6 | Counterpart Executions and Facsimile Transmissions 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
when delivered (whether in originally executed form or by facsimile

shall constitute one and the same document.

 



   8.7 | Fees and Expenses

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, and whether or not the
Arrangement is consummated, each Party hereto shall be responsible for its own
fees and expenses relating to the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated herein (including, without limitation, fees of professional
advisers, including legal counsel and auditors), except that the filing fee
in connection with any filing made under the HSR Act and all other applicable
Regulatory Laws shall be paid equally by the Parent and the Company.

 



   8.8 | Investigation 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Any investigation by a Party hereto and its advisers shall
not mitigate, diminish or affect the representations and warranties of the
other Parties hereto contained in this Agreement or any document or
certificate given pursuant thereto. The Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US
New Opco acknowledge the receipt of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the
Company acknowledges the receipt of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Each of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco acknowledges that,
except for the matters that are expressly covered by the provisions of
this Agreement, it is relying on its own investigation and analysis in
entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Arrangement. Each of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and
US New Opco is an informed and sophisticated participant in the transactions
contemplated hereby and has undertaken such investigation, and has been
provided with and has evaluated such documents and information, as it deemed
necessary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. In connection with the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New
Opcos investigation of the 

---|---|--- 
 



90 Purchaser and US New Opco received certain projections, including (without
limitation) projected statements of operating revenues and income from
operations of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries business and certain
business plan information. The Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Parent, USCo,
the Purchaser and US New Opco are familiar with such uncertainties and that
the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it,
including, without limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, the
Parent, USCo, the Purchaser and US New Opco hereby acknowledge that the
Company is making no representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, including,
without limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts. Nothing contained in this _Section
8.8(b)_ will be construed as a waiver by the Parent, USCo or Purchaser of
claims for fraud.  
---|--- 



   8.9 | Further Assurances 
---|--- 

The Parties hereto will do all such farther acts and things and will execute
such farther documents and agreements as may be necessary to give effect to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



   8.10 | Waiver 
---|--- 

Any waiver or release of any of the provisions of this Agreement, to
be effective, must be a formal written instrument signed (and not by an email
or series of emails) by the Party against whom such waiver is sought;
__provided__ , that in the case of the Parent, USCo, the Purchaser or US New
Opco, such waiver must be signed in blue ink by John F. Barry III as Chief
Executive Officer of the Parent or M. Grier Eliasek as Chief Operating Officer
of the Parent, or the successor of either of them, and in the case of the
Company signed in blue ink by Peter L. Vosotas as President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company or Ralph T. Finkenbrink as Senior Vice
President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, or the
successor of either of them. A Partys failure to insist at any time upon
strict compliance with this agreement or with any of the terms of the
agreement or any continued course of such conduct on its part will not
constitute or be considered a waiver by such Party of any of its rights or
privileges. A waiver or consent, express or implied, of or to any breach or
default by any Party in the performance by that Party of its obligations with
respect to the agreement is not a waiver or consent of or to any other breach
or default in the performance by that party of the same or any other
obligations of that Party.

 



91 ---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of the State of Delaware (U.S.A.), except to the extent
that the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the laws of
Canada are mandatorily applicable. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware (U.S.A.) and the Province of British Columbia, Canada.



   8.12 | Parties in Interest 
---|--- 

Except with respect to _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ (which are intended to be for
the benefit of the Persons identified therein, and may be enforced by such
Persons), this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

RIGHTS OF DISSENT



   4.1 | Rights of Dissent 
---|--- 

Each Shareholder and Optionholder may exercise rights of dissent ("Dissent
Rights") pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Section 242 of the BCBCA,

connection with the Arrangement; __provided that__ , notwithstanding Section

referred to in Section 242(3) of the BCBCA must be received by the Company not
later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the last business day preceding the
Meeting Date. Shareholders and Optionholders who duly exercise such Dissent
Rights and who:



     | (a) | are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid in cash
the fair value by the Purchaser for the Shares or Options, as applicable, in
respect of which they have validly exercised Dissent Rights will be deemed to
have irrevocably transferred such Shares or Options (as noted in Section
3.1(b) above, to the extent necessary to effect the transfer of such Options
by a Dissenting Optionholder to the Purchaser, the Company Stock Option Plans
and the options agreements with respect to such Options shall be amended to
permit such transfer to the Purchaser without the need for any further act or
formality), as applicable, to the Purchaser (free and clear of any Liens),
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) as of the Effective Time; or 
---|---|--- fair value by the Purchaser for the Shares or Options or if such fair value is
equal to the Option Consideration, as applicable, in respect of which they
have exercised Dissent Rights will be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the basis set forth in Section 3.1(a) or 3.1(d), as applicable,
on the same basis as the Shareholders or Optionholders who did not exercise
Dissent Rights and will be deemed to have irrevocably transferred such Shares
to the Purchaser (free and clear of any Liens) and to have such Options
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a), or (e), as applicable, as of the
Effective Time; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | but in no case will the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent
or USCo, or any other person, including the Depositary, be required to
recognize any Dissenting Shareholder or Dissenting Optionholder as a holder of
Shares or Options, as applicable, after the Effective Time, and the names of
each Dissenting Shareholder and Dissenting Optionholder will be removed from
the securities register of the Company at the Effective Time. For greater
certainty, and in addition to any other restriction under Section 242 of the
BCBCA, neither (i) Optionholders who vote, or who have instructed a
proxyholder to vote, in favor of the Arrangement Resolution, shall be entitled
to exercise Dissent Rights; nor (ii) Shareholders who vote, or who have
instructed a proxyholder to vote, in favor of the Arrangement Resolution,
shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights. 
---|---|--- 
 

ARTICLE 5

DELIVERY OF SHARES AND OPTIONS



   5.1 | Delivery of Consideration 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

At or before the Effective Time, the Company, the Purchaser, the Parent, USCo
and US New Opco shall enter into an agreement with the Depositary,
which agreement shall provide that the Purchaser, the Parent, USCo and US New
Opco shall deposit with the Depositary at or before the Effective Time, (i)
for the sole benefit of the Optionholders, cash required with respect to the
Option Consideration in an aggregate amount sufficient to satisfy the payment
of the obligations contemplated by Section 3.1(a) hereof (calculated without
reference to whether any Optionholders have exercised Dissent Rights); and
(ii) for the sole benefit of the Shareholders, Parent Shares required with
respect to the Share Consideration in an aggregate number sufficient to
satisfy the obligations contemplated by Section 3.1(d) hereof (calculated
without reference to whether any Shareholders have exercised Dissent Rights).
Such cash, in the case of Optionholders, and Parent Shares, in the case of
Shareholders, will be held solely for the purpose of satisfying, as
applicable, payment of the Option Consideration to Optionholders and the
obligation of the Share Consideration to Shareholders. The Depositary shall
invest the cash deposited with it for the Option Consideration as directed by
the Parent on a daily basis; __provided_ ,_  _ _however_ ,_ that 

---|---|--- obligations directly guaranteed by, the United States or money market funds
invested solely in the foregoing. No such gain or loss on the cash deposited
with the Depositary for the Option Consideration shall affect the amount of
Option Consideration payable to Option Holders pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
hereof. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of, and shall promptly be paid to, the Purchaser. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, such that
the cash deposited with the Depositary for the Option Consideration is less
than the amount required to make prompt payments of the aggregate Option
Consideration owing pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof, the Parent, the
Purchaser, USCo and US New Opco shall promptly advance immediately available
funds so as to ensure that such cash is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Parent, the Purchaser, USCo and US New Opco shall cause the Depositary to
mail to each Shareholder of record of a stock certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares that were
transferred pursuant to the Arrangement (i) a Letter of Transmittal, (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates in
exchange for Share Consideration as provided herein, and (iii) such additional
documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require. As soon as
practicable following the later of the Effective Time and the delivery to the
Depositary by or on behalf of a former holder of Shares of a duly completed
Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require including a stock certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the outstanding Shares
that were transferred under Section 3.1(d), and such other documents and
instruments as would have been required to effect such transfer under
the BCBCA and the articles and other organizational documents of the Company
after giving effect to Section 3.1(d), the former holder of such Shares will
be entitled to receive the Parent Shares which such former holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d), less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.4. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 5.1, each
stock certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares will be deemed after the time described in Section 3.1(d) to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Parent Shares
pursuant to Section 3.1(d) or, in the case of Dissenting Shareholders who are
ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value by the Purchaser
for the Shares in respect of which they have validly exercised Dissent
Rights, the fair value of their Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.4. 
---|---|--- USCo will cause the Depositary, as soon as practicable following the later of
the Effective Time and the date of deposit by any former holder of Shares of
the documentation required pursuant to Section 5.1(b), to: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail
(postage prepaid) to such former holder of Shares at the address specified in
the Letter of Transmittal; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | if requested by such former holder of Shares in the Letter
of Transmittal, make available at the offices of the Depositary specified in
the Letter of Transmittal for pick-up by such former holder of Shares; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | if the Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address
as described in Section 5.1(d)(i) nor contains a request as described in
Section 5.1(d)(ii), forward or cause to be forwarded by first class
mail (postage prepaid) to such former holder of Shares at the address of such
former holder as shown on the securities register of the Company maintained by
or on behalf of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 
 

in each case under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Parent Shares to which
such former holder of Shares is entitled in accordance with the provisions
hereof.



     | (e) | As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective
Time and the delivery to the Depositary of the articles and other
organizational documents of the Company after giving effect to Section 3.1(a),
the former holder of such Options will be entitled to receive the Option
Consideration which such former holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.4. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | From and after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will thereafter be deemed to represent
only the right to receive a cash payment equal to the Option Consideration,
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(a), or, in
the case of Dissenting Optionholders who are ultimately determined to be
entitled to be paid fair value by the Purchaser for the Options in respect of
which they have validly exercised Dissent Rights, the fair value of their
Options, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.4. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Parent, the Purchaser, USCo and US New Opco shall cause the Depositary
to deposit with the Company the aggregate amount of Option Consideration. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter forward or cause to be
forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid) a check to such former holder
of Options at the last known address on file with the Company, or with
respect to each former holder of Options who is an employee of the Company,
deposit to the account specified by such employee for the deposit of
paychecks, in an amount equal to the net cash payment to which such former
holder of Options is entitled in accordance with the provisions hereof, less
any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.4. 
---|---|--- this Agreement, no fractional Parent Shares will be issued pursuant to this
Plan of Arrangement. A fractional interest in a Parent Share shall be
satisfied by a cash payment (without interest) determined by multiplying such
fraction by an amount equal to the VWAP of a Parent Share for the twenty (20)
Trading Days prior to and ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.  
---|---|--- 



   5.2 | Lost Certificates 
---|--- 

If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
one or more the outstanding Shares that were acquired by the Purchaser in
accordance with Section 3.1(d) has been lost, stolen or destroyed prior to
surrender to the Depositary, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the former holder of Shares claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Depositary shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Parent Shares which such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d). When authorizing such delivery in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the former holder of
Shares to whom such Parent Shares are to be delivered shall, as a condition
precedent to the delivery of such Parent Shares, indemnify the Company, the
Purchaser and the Depositary, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser and the Depositary, against any claim that may be made against the
Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



   5.3 | Extinguishment of Rights 
---|--- 

If any former holder of Shares exchanged pursuant to Section 3.1(d) has not
have complied with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 on or before
the date which is six years after the Effective Date, the Parent Shares, net
of any applicable withholding or other taxes, held by the Depositary on
behalf of such former holder of Shares, will be delivered to the Purchaser and
the interest of the former holder of Shares in such Parent Shares will be
deemed to have been donated and surrendered to the Purchaser, for no
consideration as of such date. Any certificate representing the outstanding
Shares which has not been deposited with the Depositary in accordance with
Section 5.1 on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall,
as of such date, cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature
whatsoever against the Company or the Purchaser.



   5.4 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 

The Purchaser, the Depositary and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration payable to any former holder of Shares or
Options such amounts as the Purchaser, the Depositary or the Company is
required, entitled or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada), as amended, including the
regulations thereunder, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local
or   foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the former holder of Shares or Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amount is
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
