2. THE MERGER.

2.1. Effects of the Merger. At and upon the Effective Time:

(a) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger;

(b) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in their entirety to read as set forth in the Certificate of Merger,
until thereafter amended as provided by the applicable provisions of the KGCC
or other applicable law;

(c) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in their entirety
to read as the Bylaws of Merger Sub, until thereafter amended as provided by
the applicable provisions of the KGCC or other applicable law;

(d) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be appointed as the sole officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly appointed;

(e) the members of the Board of Directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be appointed as the sole members of the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified;
and

(f) the Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time, have all of the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the KGCC
and other applicable law.

2.2. Conversion of Shares.

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the
need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
Common Stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of
the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are
so converted shall be the only shares of Company Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

* * *





(b) Conversion of Company Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into and represent the right to receive an amount
of cash, without interest, equal to the Closing Cash Amount Per Share, which
shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.2(a) and the amount of the
Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments payable in respect of such share of
Company Stock, which shall be paid in accordance with Section 3.3. The
preceding provisions of this Section 2.2(b) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.2(c) (regarding rights of holders of Dissenting Shares). The amount
of cash each holder of Company Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Section 2.2(b) for the Company Stock held by such
holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The provisions of this Section
2.2(b) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Company Stockholders.

(c) Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Stock
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action, cease to exist, and
all such securities shall be converted into the right to receive from Acquiror
the cash amount to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(b). If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company Stock are
entitled to appraisal or dissenters' rights pursuant to the KGCC, any
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive cash as
provided in Section 2.2(b), but shall be converted into the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to the KGCC. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the KGCC, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the KGCC (but only
after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to such law). In the event that any Company Stockholder fails to make
an effective demand for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal or
dissenters' rights as to its shares of Company Stock or any Dissenting Shares
shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares
shall immediately be converted into the right to receive the consideration
issuable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) in respect of such shares had such shares
never been Dissenting Shares, and at Closing (or promptly thereafter) Acquiror
shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof the cash, without interest
thereon, to which such Company Stockholder would have been entitled under
Section 2.2(b) with respect to such shares. The Company shall give Acquiror
prompt notice (and in no event more than two (2) Business Days after receipt
thereof) of any demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company Stock
or notice of exercise of a Company Stockholder's appraisal or dissenters'
rights, and Acquiror shall have the right to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company agrees that, except
with Acquiror's prior written consent, it shall not voluntarily make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal or dissenters'
rights.

(d) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock. Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b), each
share of Company Stock held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

(e) Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, all
references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or
series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon
numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, shall be equitably

WA 4941984.13 

 





WCSR 32390522v12

* * *





adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

(f) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or with
its transfer agent of any Company Stock that was outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Company Certificates
or Affidavits are presented for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.

2.3. Withholding. Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from, or in respect of, payments made
in connection with the Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Legal Requirements relating to Taxes. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority by Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the applicable Company Stockholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

2.4. Certain Duties and Responsibilities in connection with the Merger.
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.4 and Article 11, the Litigation Side
Letter and the Special Indemnity Side Letter, Acquiror (or its designee) shall
be responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with
representing the Company and the Surviving Corporation following the Closing
with respect to complying with all applicable Legal Requirements. Any Closing
Cash Amount Per Share payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) remaining unclaimed
as of a date which is six (6) months following the Closing Date or any
Subsequent Merger Consideration Payments remaining unclaimed as of the date
which is six (6) months after the date such payment is determined in
accordance with this Agreement ("Unclaimed Amounts") shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall
thereafter remain solely liable for the payment of any Unclaimed Amounts
without interest to any holder of Company Stock after delivery of the items
required by Section 3.2.

2.5. Escrow.

(a) At the Closing, Acquiror shall pay to the Escrow Agent, to be held as
provided in this Agreement, the Litigation Side Letter, the Special Indemnity
Side Letter and the escrow agreement among the Acquiror, the Representative
and the Escrow Agent in the form of Exhibit E (the "Escrow Agreement"), to an
escrow account (the "Indemnity Escrow Fund") designated by the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to $9,375,000.00 (the "Indemnity Escrow Amount"), which will be
available solely to pay the valid indemnity claims of the Acquiror Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 11.2 and the Special Indemnity Side Letter and the
Litigation Side Letter and the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.9(e).
The Unclaimed Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be released in full to the
Representative on the Survival Termination Date, which shall be first used to
pay any Representative Expenses in excess of the Holdback Amount as set forth
in Section 2.7 and then paid to the Company Stockholders in proportion to
their Pro Rata Shares. Any remaining Unclaimed Indemnity Escrow Amount that
the Company Stockholders thereafter become entitled to receive under the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall thereafter be first used to
pay any Representative Expenses in excess of the Holdback Amount as set forth
in Section 2.7 and then paid to the Company Stockholders in proportion to
their Pro Rata Shares.

(b) At the Closing, Acquiror shall pay to the Escrow Agent to be held as
provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to an escrow account (the
"Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund") designated by the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to $1,000,000.00 (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount"),
which will be available solely to pay any amount by which the Adjustment
Amount is a negative number.

(c) At the Closing, Acquiror shall pay to the Escrow Agent to be held as
provided in this Agreement, the Special Indemnity Side Letter and the Escrow
Agreement to an escrow account (the "Special Escrow Fund" and together with
the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the
"Escrow Fund") designated by the Escrow Agent an amount equal to $3,800,000.00
(the "Special Escrow Amount" and together with the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Amount"), which will
be available solely to pay such amounts as set forth in the Special Indemnity
Side Letter, and will be released on such terms as set forth in the Special
Indemnity Side Letter.

(d) Any fees owed to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall
be paid by the Acquiror.

(e) The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to
any Lien of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Special Indemnity Side Letter, the Litigation Side Letter and the Escrow
Agreement.

2.6. Holdback. The Holdback Amount shall be paid to and held by the
Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, to satisfy potential
future obligations of the Company Stockholders to the Representative,
including expenses of the Representative arising from the defense or
enforcement of claims pursuant to Section 2.7. The Holdback Amount shall be
retained in whole or in part by the Representative for such time as the
Representative shall determine in its sole discretion in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any remaining
portion of the Holdback Amount available for distribution to the Company
Stockholders, if any, shall be paid by the Representative to the Company
Stockholders no later than five (5) years after the Effective Time. Any
amounts distributed from the Holdback Amount to the Company Stockholders shall
be distributed to them by the Representative in proportion to their Pro Rata
Shares. Neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation or responsibility with respect to the distribution of funds from
the Holdback Amount, or interest in or claim to the Holdback Amount.

2.7. Appointment of Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement or
participating in the conversion of Company Stock, each Company Stockholder
approves the designation of and designates the Representative as the
representative of the Company Stockholder and as the attorney-in-fact and
agent for and on behalf of the Company Stockholder with respect to the taking
by the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to: (i) give and receive notices and
communications to or from Acquiror and object to, negotiate and resolve any
calculation of Net Working Capital set forth in Section 2.9; (ii) give and
receive notices and communications to or from Acquiror and object to,
negotiate and resolve any indemnity claims set forth in Article 11, including

the judgment of the

* * *





Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Company
Stockholders shall be bound by all actions and decisions taken and consents
and instructions given by the Representative in connection with this
Agreement, and Acquiror shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement (including Section
11) and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on (without further evidence of
any kind whatsoever), and shall be relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with, any such action, decision,
consent or instruction of the Representative on behalf of any Company
Stockholder as being fully binding upon such Person. Any decision or action by
the Representative hereunder, including any agreement between the
Representative and Acquiror relating to the defense, payment or settlement of
any claims for indemnification hereunder, shall constitute a decision or
action of all Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon each such Person. No Company Stockholder shall have the right to object
to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of
this Section 2.7, including the power of attorney granted hereby, are
independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and
shall not be terminated by any act of any Person or by operation of law,
whether by death or other event. Notices or communications to or from the
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Stockholders. The Person serving as the Representative may be replaced from
time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Pro Rata Shares
upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Acquiror, which
notice shall specify the Person replacing the Representative, the effective
date of such replacement and other information reasonably requested by
Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Representative, and the
Representative shall receive no compensation for his, her or its services. The
Representative shall elect a manager to act on behalf on the Representative
authorized to act on behalf of the Representative pursuant to its
Organizational Documents and shall not change the manager or authorize
additional officers to act on behalf of the Representative without prior
notice to Acquiror and delivery of a new Representative Certificate. Acquiror
shall be permitted to conclusively rely solely on the actions of the manager
of the Representative as set forth in the most recently delivered
Representative Certificate.

(b) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the
Representative shall not be liable to any Company Stockholder in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representative.
Each Company Stockholder shall severally (based on their Pro Rata Shares), and
not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Representative from and against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his, her or its duties
hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and
other legal costs reasonably incurred by the Representative (the
"Representative Expenses"). If in excess of the Holdback Amount or otherwise
not paid directly to the Representative by the Company Stockholders, the
Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Representative from the Escrow
Fund otherwise distributable to the Company Stockholders at the time such
amounts are otherwise to be paid from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms
hereof, and such recovery will be made from the Company Stockholders according
to their respective Pro Rata Shares. Neither Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have any liability for the Representative Expenses.

2.8. Estimated Closing Statement.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Acquiror a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth, in accordance with GAAP to the extent applicable (except as set
forth on Schedule 4.15(a)):

WA 4941984.13 

 





WCSR 32390522v12

* * *





(i) the Company's good faith estimate of the balance sheet of Company as of
the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet");

(ii) the Company's good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital");

(iii) the names and addresses of all the Company Stockholders;

(iv) the number and kind of shares of Company Stock held of record by each
Company Stockholder;

(v) the calculation of the Fully-Diluted Company Stock;

(vi) the Pro Rata Share of each Company Stockholder;

(vii) the Company Debt not paid by the Company prior to the Closing;

(viii) the Company Bonuses not paid by the Company prior to the Closing;

(ix) the Company Merger Expenses not paid by the Company prior to the Closing;

(x) the Closing Cash Amount Per Share; and

(xi) the amount of cash payable to each Company Stockholder under Section
3.2(a) (and the amount of cash required to be deducted and withheld from such
Persons for Taxes, if any).

(b) The Parties agree that Acquiror and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely
on the calculations of the Closing Cash Amount Per Share and the amount of
cash payable to each Company Stockholder under Section 3.2(a) as set forth on
the Estimated Closing Statement and shall not be responsible for such
calculations. As promptly as practicable, Acquiror shall identify any
adjustments that Acquiror believes are required to the Estimated Closing
Statement delivered by the Company. If the Company disputes any such
adjustments, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such
dispute, after which the Company shall re-deliver to Acquiror the Estimated
Closing Statement with such adjustments as the Parties have agreed are
appropriate. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the
payments made pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be based on (i) the Company's
version of the Estimated Closing Statement if the difference in the aggregate
Closing Cash Amount Per Share in the Company's and Acquiror's Estimated
Closing Statement is less than $250,000; or (ii) if the difference in the
aggregate Closing Cash Amount Per Share is $250,000 or more, either (A) at
Acquiror's election, the Company's version of the Estimated Closing Statement
or (B) either Acquiror's version of the Estimated Closing Statement or the
Company's version of the Estimated Closing Statement, as determined by the
Independent Accountant within ten (10) Business Days after Acquiror requests
such a determination. Nothing in this Section 2.8(b) shall waive any rights or
procedures set forth in Section 2.9.

2.9. Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall deliver to
the Representative, acting on behalf of the Company Stockholders as set forth
in this Agreement, a final

WA 4941984.13 

 





WCSR 32390522v12

* * *





calculation (the "Final Report"), showing in reasonable detail Acquiror's good
faith calculation of the Net Working Capital. If the Representative does not
respond within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final Report, or agrees
to the Final Report, the Final Report shall be deemed final and binding upon
all parties to this Agreement and not subject to dispute or judicial review
and the date that is the thirtieth (30th) day after Acquiror delivers the
Final Report shall be the "Final Determination Date"). If the Representative
disputes any matter or item set forth in the Final Report, the Representative
may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Final Report, provide to
Acquiror a written statement of such disputes. The Representative and Acquiror
shall use good faith efforts to jointly resolve such disputes within thirty
(30) days after Acquiror's receipt of the Representative's written statement,
which resolution, if achieved, shall be binding upon all parties to this
Agreement and not subject to dispute or judicial review and the date of such
resolution shall be the Final Determination Date. If the Representative and
Acquiror cannot resolve such disputes to their mutual satisfaction within such
thirty (30)-day period, the Representative and Acquiror shall, within the
following ten (10) days, jointly engage the Independent Accountant to review
the Final Report together with the Representative's statement of disputes and
any other relevant documents. The Independent Accountant shall calculate the
Net Working Capital and the other adjustments using the items included in the
Final Report which are not disputed by Acquiror and the Representative and
shall make its own determination of any item which is disputed by Acquiror and
the Representative, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement; provided, however, in no event shall any such determination by the
Independent Accountant be higher or lower than the respective amount therefor
proposed by Acquiror and the Representative. The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Independent Accountant that its determination was prepared in accordance with
this Agreement with respect to such dispute. The Independent Accountant shall
report its conclusions as to such disputes and its determination of Net
Working Capital based thereon pursuant to this Section 2.9 no later than
thirty (30) days after it is engaged by the Representative and Acquiror, which
determination shall be conclusive on all parties to this Agreement and not
subject to further dispute or judicial review and the date the Independent
Account reports its conclusions shall be the Final Determination Date.

(b) One-half (1/2) of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be paid by the Acquiror and the other one-half (1/2) of such fees and
expenses shall be paid by the Representative on behalf of the Company
Stockholders (pro rata in accordance with each Company Stockholder's Pro Rata
Share).

(c) If the Adjustment Amount equals zero, the Parties shall promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days after the Final Determination Date)
cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Company Stockholders, by wire
transfer of immediately available United States funds to one or more accounts
designated in writing by the Representative, or in such other manner as
Representative may direct, all funds remaining in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account, as set forth more fully in the Escrow Agreement.

may direct, as set forth more fully in the Escrow Agreement.

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Parties shall promptly
(but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Final Determination

the extent of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account the absolute value
of such Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available United
States funds to one or more accounts designated by the Acquiror to the

the shortfall may, at Acquiror's sole election, be paid from the Indemnity
Escrow Account, to the extent funds are available therein, and (ii) distribute
to the Company Stockholders, pro rata in accordance with each Company

operations.

Company). No claim has been made relative to any particular Tax, since January
1, 2004 by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file
Tax Returns for such a Tax, that the Company is or may be subject to such Tax
in that jurisdiction. The Company does not have a "permanent establishment" in
any foreign country, as such term is defined in any applicable Tax treaty or
convention between the United States and such foreign country, nor has it

does it have any liability for the Taxes of any Person as a transferee or
successor, by Contract, or otherwise.

Code by virtue of it being a small business corporation. The Company has not
entered into any Contract, plan or arrangement covering any employee,
independent contractor or other provider of services to the Company that,
individually or collectively, could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
payment after Closing, in the event of a change in control of the Company

assets of the Company after Closing, that would not be deductible by the
Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

(h) The Company has made a valid election under Section 1361 et seq. of the
Code to be an "S corporation" (Subchapter S corporation) for federal income

federal income Tax purposes, and for state income Tax purposes in all states
that permit comparable flow-through income Tax treatment for state purposes
(whether or not the state requires a separate state election), since January
1, 2007 and will be an "S corporation" in such jurisdictions up to and
including the Closing Date. No actions or omissions have been committed by the
Company, the Company Stockholders or otherwise to cause the Company to cease
to so qualify as an "S corporation." The Company Stockholders are (i) eligible
to join Acquiror in making a Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the
Company and the purchase and sale of the Company Stock resulting from the
Merger, and (ii) all of the "S corporation shareholders" who must consent to

part, by reference to the Tax basis of the acquired assets in the hands of the
transferor.

with respect to the Company that have been audited or examined by a Taxing
authority since December 31, 2008. The Company has delivered to or made
available to Acquiror correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns filed by

provide to each of the Continuing Employees annual base salary and base wages
and target bonus opportunities that are at least as favorable as such annual
base salary and base wages and target bonus opportunities provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Until December 31,
2014, or such longer period of time as is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, Acquiror will cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to
maintain employee benefits for each of the Continuing Employees which are at
least as favorable as those employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and

the Company or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee
benefit plans during such period.

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Acquiror will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit service rendered by the
Continuing Employees prior to the Closing for all purposes (including for

Corporation from and after the Closing to the same extent as such service was
taken into account under corresponding plans of the Company for such purposes.
Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide that the Continuing Employees will (and with respect to
insurance arrangements with third parties, Acquiror will provide, or cause any
third party insurance provider to provide, that the Continuing Employees will)
not be subject to any pre-existing condition or other limitation under any
health or welfare plans of the Surviving Corporation for any condition for
which such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of the Company in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing, all to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, Acquiror will cause such

the Parties, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person, any right, benefit or remedy of any

amend, modify or terminate any of the Employee Plans or any other benefit or

consolidation, business combination, share exchange, sale of substantial

tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any of the foregoing inquiries or
proposals being referred to herein as a "Transaction Proposal"), (b) engage in
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information
to any Person relating to, any Transaction Proposal, or (c) agree to approve

or has made, a Transaction Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company's officers, directors, employees, representatives, Affiliates or
agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing

6.11. Updated Schedules. Not less than five (5) days prior to Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Acquiror an update to the Schedules to this Agreement

purposes of evaluating whether the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) has
been satisfied. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless Acquiror is permitted to and provides the Company with a
termination notice (which notice may only be delivered if Acquiror is entitled
to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)), at the Effective Time
the Schedules shall be deemed to be updated by the Schedules Update for

promptly notify the other Parties in writing (a) if it becomes aware of any
fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any

reasonably be expected to have, individually

or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (c) of receipt of any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (d) of any actions commenced or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.10 or that relates to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Acquiror's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by the Company in this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to amend or supplement the Schedules to this Agreement unless also
delivered pursuant to Section 6.11.

6.13. Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, Acquiror shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to the exculpation from personal liability and
indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, directors, officers,
employees and agents than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Company as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that if any claim
or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the protections of
such provisions within such six (6)−year period, such provisions shall not be
modified in a manner adverse to such individual until the final disposition of
any such claims. Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify,
and advance expenses to, each present and former director, officer, employee,
agent or employee benefit plan fiduciary (a "Surviving Corporation Indemnified
Person") of the Company (including rights relating to advancement of expenses
and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they are
serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of another entity at the
request of the Company) in respect of actions, omissions or events through the
Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in the Organizational Documents
of the Company, any indemnification agreement set forth on Schedule 6.13(a) or
under applicable Legal Requirements, in each case, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that any determination required to be made
with respect to whether a Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person's conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the applicable Legal Requirements,
the Organizational Documents of the Company, or any such agreement, as the
case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel jointly selected by
such Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person and Acquiror. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Surviving Corporation
Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit,
claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 6.13(a) after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, promptly advance to such Surviving Corporation
Indemnified Person his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to the providing by such Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person of an
undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a
non−appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto under the
KGCC or other applicable Legal Requirements with respect to such proceeding.

settlement entered into by a Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person without

in a final and non−appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements. Any Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.13(a), upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation of such claim and the relevant
facts and circumstances with respect thereto; provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of Acquiror
and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices their ability to defend such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

(b) At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail"
insurance policies naming the Company's officers and directors as direct
beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing
Date in an amount and scope customary for companies similar in size and nature
of operations to the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Surviving Corporation Indemnified Person,
his or her heirs, executors or similar representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Acquiror, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to
the Surviving Corporation Indemnified Persons (including their successors,
assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Surviving Corporation
Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. This Section 6.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time.

6.14. Further Actions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each of the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth
in Section 8 and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including providing assistance to Acquiror in obtaining access to
and contacting the Company's customers, vendors and Employees upon request and
pursuant to Section 6.2.

6.15. Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, the Representative shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its employees, officers, managers, members and beneficiaries
to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral,
concerning the Company or the Surviving Corporation, except to the extent that
the Representative can show that such information (a) is generally available
to and known by the public through no fault of the Representative or any of
its Affiliates, employees, officers, managers, members and beneficiaries; or
(b) is lawfully acquired by the Representative or any of its Affiliates,
employees, officers, managers, members, and beneficiaries from and after the
Closing from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information
by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If the Representative or any
of its Affiliates, employees, officers, managers, members and beneficiaries is
compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or
by other Legal Requirements, such Person shall promptly notify Acquiror and
the Surviving Corporation in writing and shall disclose only that portion of
such information that such Person is advised by its counsel in writing is
legally required to be disclosed; provided, that the Representative shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

7.1. S Corporation Status. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
not permit any of the Company Stockholders to revoke the Company's election to
be Taxed as an "S corporation," or take or allow any action or fail to take
any action that would result in the termination of the Company's status as a
validly electing "S corporation" within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362
of the Code.

7.2. Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(a) The Company Stockholders and Acquiror shall make a timely, irrevocable and
effective election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar
election under any applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law
(collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the Merger.

(b) To facilitate the Section 338(h)(10) Election, Acquiror shall deliver to
the Representative promptly following the date of this Agreement and at least
ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, copies of IRS Form 8023 and any
similar forms under applicable state, local and foreign income Tax law
(collectively, the "Election Forms") properly completed to the extent
pertaining to Acquiror and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Representative shall cause the Election Forms to be properly completed by the
Company Stockholders to the extent pertaining to the Company Stockholders and
duly executed by each of the Company Stockholders at the Closing. Acquiror
shall duly and timely file the Election Forms as prescribed by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding provisions of
applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in any event within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall provide to the
Representative a complete IRS Form 8883. Such Form 8883 shall include the
allocation of the "aggregate deemed sales price" among all of the assets of
the Company and shall be prepared (i) in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, and (ii) otherwise as determined by Acquiror's
independent accountants acting in their capacity as outside auditors based
upon an appraisal performed in a customary and reasonable manner of the
relative fair market value of each of the assets (or categories of assets) of
the Company (the "Final Merger Consideration Allocation"), which Final Merger
Consideration Allocation shall be final and binding on the Parties for all
purposes of this Agreement (the "Binding Form 8883"). The Final Merger
Consideration Allocation shall also be consistent with the methodology set
forth on Schedule 7.2(c) for allocating the "aggregate deemed sales price"
among all of the assets of the Company, which methodology the Parties hereby
agree is consistent with the requirements of Section 338 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Parties further agree that
any adjustment to the Closing Cash Amount Per Share pursuant to Section 2.9(f)
and any other adjustment pursuant to this Agreement to the aggregate
consideration paid by Acquiror for the Company Stock shall be allocated to
goodwill. Each of Acquiror, the Company, the Representative and the Company
Stockholders shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns consistent with,
and shall not take any income Tax position inconsistent with, the Final Merger
Consideration Allocation unless otherwise required to do so by applicable
Legal Requirement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall attach a copy
of the Binding Form 8883 to its final Form 1120S (and corresponding final
state S corporation income Tax Returns) filed for the taxable period beginning
on January 1, 2014 and ending at the close of the day on the Closing Date.

7.3. Calculation of Tax Liabilities. For purposes of calculating the Net
Working Capital under Section 2.9 and for purposes of allocating
responsibility for Taxes of the Company between the Company

WCSR 32390522v12

Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, all Taxes
of the Company (including, without limitation, any liability of the Company
for Taxes as a member of any affiliated, unitary or combined group, as a
transferee or successor, or pursuant to any contractual obligation)
attributable to any taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
the portion through the end of the day on the Closing Date for any Straddle
Period (as defined below) (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") shall be the
responsibility of the Company Stockholders to the extent not included as
Current Liabilities. With respect to any Taxable Period commencing before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
Taxes of the Company attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be (a)
in the case of a Tax that is not based on net income, gross income, margin,
sales, use, premiums or gross receipts, the total amount of such Tax for the
period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of a Tax
that is based on any of net income, gross income, margin, sales, use, premiums
or gross receipts, the Tax that would be due with respect to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period if such Pre-Closing Tax Period were a separate Taxable Period. For
the avoidance of doubt, (i) pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(3)(i), the Company's status as an S corporation for federal
and applicable state income tax purposes will continue through the close of
the day on the Closing Date and (ii) pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A), the taxable year of the Company for federal and
applicable state income tax purposes beginning on January 1, 2014 will end at
the close of the day on the Closing Date.

7.4. Preparation of Tax Returns. Other than as contemplated in the Special
Indemnity Side Letter, the Representative shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed, all income Tax
Returns required to be filed for the Company for all taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date (each such Tax Return relating to income Taxes
being a "Final Income Tax Return") including, without limitation, final S
corporation income Tax Returns for federal and applicable state income tax
purposes for the period beginning on January 1, 2014 and ending at the close
of the day on the Closing Date. Such Final Income Tax Returns shall be
prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and consistent with
past practices of the Company to the extent that they were so compliant. The
Company or the Representative, as applicable, shall permit Acquiror (i) to
review and approve each such Final Income Tax Return during a reasonable
period prior to filing (it being understood that no such Tax Return shall be
filed without Acquiror's prior written approval), such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) to reasonably determine
whether such Final Income Tax Returns constitute all of the Final Income Tax
Returns required by applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties agree that (i) provided the "net recognized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374 of the Code) reflected on the
Company's federal Final Income Tax Return for the period beginning January 1,
2014 and ending at the close of the day on the Closing Date is calculated
using the Appraisal and in a manner consistent with the methodology set forth
on Schedule 8.1(s), such federal Final Income Tax Return shall not be subject
to Acquiror's prior written approval (but shall be subject to comment by
Acquiror, which comments shall be considered in good faith by the
Representative and the preparers of such Final Income Tax Return) and (ii) the
Company on its Final Income Tax Returns may treat any deferred income or
unearned income liabilities that are included in Current Liabilities under
this Agreement as a deemed payment of a trade or business expense under
Section 162 of the Code. In the event Acquiror reasonably determines that one
or more additional Final Income Tax returns are required by applicable Legal
Requirements to be filed, the Parties shall cooperate in the timely
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. To the extent any such Final
Income Tax Return reflects (i) a Company Tax liability with respect to the
"net recognized built-in gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374 of the Code
and corresponding provisions of applicable state and local tax Legal
Requirements) resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election or (ii) income
Tax withholding required by the Company with respect to income allocable to
the Company Stockholders, Acquiror and the Representative shall cooperate with
one another regarding the payment of such Tax liability, with the Acquiror
responsible

for any such Tax liability to the extent it was taken into account as a
Current Liability on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet for purposes of
calculating Net Working Capital and the Company Stockholders responsible for
any such Tax liability to the extent it was not taken account as a Current
Liability on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet for purposes of calculating
Net Working Capital. Except for such Final Income Tax Returns, Acquiror shall
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for the
Company required to be filed after the Closing Date. However, to the extent
such Tax Returns include any Straddle Period, Acquiror shall permit the
Representative to review and approve each such Tax Return during a reasonable
period prior to filing (it being understood that no such Tax Return shall be
filed without the Representative's prior written approval), such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any disputed items with
respect to the preparation of Final Income Tax Returns shall be referred for
timely resolution by the Independent Accountant (the costs of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.9(b)), whose
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive as to Acquiror, the
Representative and their respective Affiliates and the Company Stockholders.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.4 or the Special Indemnity Side
Letter, none of Acquiror, the Company, or the Surviving Corporation shall file
any new Tax Returns or amend any previously filed Tax Returns of the Company
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent
of the Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), unless any such new Tax Return or amended Tax Return
is required to be filed because of applicable Legal Requirements.

7.5. Refunds. Unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, no
amended Tax Return, claim for refund or other Tax-related filing on behalf of
the Company may be filed by any Company Stockholder or the Representative
without the prior written consent of the Acquiror (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event any such amended
Tax Return or claim for refund results in a refund of Taxes of the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Acquiror shall pay (or cause to be paid) to the
Representative for the benefit of the Company Stockholders any such refund
(net of any Taxes incurred in connection with the receipt of such refund and
net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Acquiror or the Company in
connection with such amended Tax Return or refund claim) relating to Taxes of
the Company with respect to Taxable Periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, but only to the extent (i) such refund was not taken
into account in calculating Net Working Capital under Section 2.9 and (ii)
such refund is not the result of the carryback of any Tax attribute of the
Company from any period after the Closing Date. Any payments required to be
made under this Section 7.5 shall be made in readily available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the receipt of the Tax refund.

7.6. Tax Cooperation. The Representative and Acquiror shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Company, its assets or business
(including access to books and records as well as the timely provision of
powers of attorney or similar authorizations) as is reasonably necessary for
the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any Tax authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or deficiency, assessment, claim,
suit or other proceeding relating to any Taxes or Tax Return. The
Representative and Acquiror shall cooperate with each other in good faith in
the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes and all other
Tax matters relating to the Company, its assets or business and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. The Representative and
Acquiror shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or
other documents in their possession (or in the possession of their Affiliates)
relating to Tax matters of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and for
any Straddle Period until the later of (a) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the Taxable Periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions, and (b) six (6) years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before the Representative or Acquiror shall dispose of any such
documents in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the

other party shall be given an opportunity, after ninety (90) calendar days'
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other party's expense). Any
information obtained under this provision shall be kept confidential, except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

or agreements contained in this Agreement, if Acquiror or Merger Sub breaches

covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure
to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in

breach of warranty or representation or nonfulfillment of any covenant or
agreement by Acquiror or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement; or

(e) by the Company after four (4) months from the date of this agreement plus
the unexpired portion of Acquiror's Cure Period plus one day, if any of the

representation or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by the Company
contained in this Agreement.

or Member) shall be liable to any other Party for any cost, expense, damage or
loss hereunder.

(b) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 10.1(b) hereof, Acquiror shall have the right to pursue any legal or
equitable remedies for breach of contract or otherwise.

(c) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing until, and shall terminate on, the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Survival Termination Date"); provided, however, that
the

|

|

WA 4941984.13 

 





WCSR 32390522v12

* * *





Survival Termination Date shall not apply to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.1 (Organization; Authority), Section 4.3
(Authorization; Enforceability), Section 4.5 (Capitalization), Section 4.9
(Taxes), or Section 4.19 (No Broker), Section 5.1 (Organization, Standing and
Authority), Section 5.2 (Authorization and Binding Obligation) and Section 5.6
(No Broker) (the "Fundamental Representations and Warranties"), or Section
4.11(b) (Compliance with Laws). The representations and warranties in (a)
Section 4.1 (Organization; Authority), Section 4.3 (Authorization;
Enforceability), Section 4.5 (Capitalization), Section 5.1 (Organization,
Standing and Authority) and Section 5.2 (Authorization and Binding Obligation)
shall survive indefinitely, (b) Section 4.9 (Taxes), Section 4.19 (No Broker)
and Section 5.6 (No Broker) shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extensions thereof) plus sixty (60) days, and (c) Section 4.11(b) (Compliance
with Laws) shall survive until the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing
Date. All covenants and agreements of the parties contained herein shall
survive indefinitely or for the period explicitly specified therein. No claim
for indemnification hereunder for breach of any representation or warranty may
be made after the expiration of the survival period set forth in this Section
11.1, provided that any claim that is made prior to the Survival Termination
Date or, with respect to claims for Losses resulting from breaches of the
Fundamental Representations and Warranties, the later applicable expiration
date, shall be deemed timely made even if such claim continues beyond the
Survival Termination Date or such later applicable expiration date. No claim
for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(iv) may be made after the date that
is eighteen (18) months immediately following the Closing Date, and no claim
for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(viii) may be made after the date
that is twenty-four (24) months immediately following the Closing Date,
provided that any claim that is made prior to the applicable expiration date
set forth in this sentence shall be deemed timely made even if such claim
continues beyond such applicable expiration date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is the specific intention of the parties that
the Survival Termination Date and each later applicable expiration date, as
applicable to a particular claim in accordance with the above, constitutes a
limitation of and modification of the statute of limitations time period
otherwise applicable to any such claim arising under this Agreement.

11.2. Indemnification Rights of Acquiror.

(a) After the Closing, Acquiror, its Affiliates and any of their respective
employees, officers, managers, directors, stockholders, members, advisers,
representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the "Acquiror Indemnitees")
shall be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless by the Company
Stockholders pro rata solely to the extent of each Company Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share from and against all liability, loss, damage, claim, action,
judgment, injury, settlement, Tax, deficiency, award, fine, interest and
penalty and all costs and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and
costs and expenses of any suit related thereto or relating to investigating,
preparing, defending against, prosecuting or settling any such suit) of any
kind or character (collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by the
Acquiror Indemnitees arising from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or any Transaction Document to which it is a party;

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement of the Company in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to
which it is a party to be performed by the Company at or prior to the
Effective Time;

(iii) any amounts paid to the holders of Dissenting Shares, including any
interest required to be paid thereon, that are in excess of what such holders
would have received hereunder had such holders not been holders of Dissenting
Shares;

(iv) any Company Debt, Company Bonus or Company Merger Expenses to the extent
not taken into account in calculating the Net Working Capital;

(v) any Losses suffered by Acquiror resulting from, arising out of, relating
to or caused by any acts of the Representative without due authorization of
the Company Stockholders, in violation of its Organizational Documents or in
violation of a contractual or fiduciary duty to the Company Stockholders;

(vi) (A) all Taxes of the Company (including, without limitation, any
liability of the Company for Taxes as a member of an affiliated, unitary or
combined group, as a transferee or successor, or pursuant to any contractual
obligation) attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent not taken
into account in calculating the Net Working Capital, (B) all Taxes of the
Company in any way arising out of or resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election (including, without limitation, Taxes on "net recognized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374 of the Code and corresponding
provisions of applicable state and local Tax Legal Requirements) to the extent
not taken into account in calculating the Net Working Capital), other than 50%
of any Transfer Taxes and (C) all Taxes flowing through to the Company
Stockholders as shareholders of an "S corporation" for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods;

(vii) any Losses suffered by Acquiror resulting from the matters disclosed on
Schedule 4.10 as pending against the Company (the "Litigation"); and

(viii) any Losses suffered by Acquiror resulting from the matters disclosed on
Item 2 of Schedule 4.11.

(b) The Acquiror Indemnitees will not be entitled to be indemnified under
Section 11.2(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of the Losses of the Acquiror
Indemnitees exceed Two Million Eight Hundred Twelve Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($2,812,500.00) (the "Deductible Amount"). If the aggregate amount of
the Losses under Section 11.2(a)(i) exceed the Deductible Amount, then
Acquiror shall be entitled to be indemnified only for such Losses in excess of
the Deductible Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount
will not apply to indemnified Losses resulting from breaches of the
Fundamental Representations and Warranties of the Company or the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.11(b),
and no such Losses shall be counted in determining whether the Deductible
Amount has been exceeded or met.

(c) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Company Stockholders may
be liable pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(a)(vii) and Section
11.2(a)(viii) shall not exceed Nine Million Three Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($9,375,000.00) (the "Cap"); provided, however,
that the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Company Stockholders may
be liable pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(vii) shall not exceed Five Million Six
Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($5,625,000.00) (the "Litigation Cap")
(for the avoidance of doubt, the Litigation Cap is a subset of and included
within the Cap and is not in addition to the Cap); further provided, however,
the Cap will not apply to Losses resulting from breaches of the Fundamental
Representations and Warranties of the Company, and no such Losses shall be
counted in determining whether the Cap has been exceeded or met.
Notwithstanding the prior sentence or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Company
Stockholders may be liable pursuant to this Section 11 shall not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the Base Merger Consideration.

(d) Any indemnification payment to be made by the Company Stockholders to
Acquiror pursuant to Section 11.2(a) (as limited by Section 11.2(c)) shall be
paid (i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, or, to the extent permitted
by this Agreement or the Special Indemnity Side Letter, the Special Escrow
Amount, and (ii) second, to the extent such Losses exceed the amounts
available to Acquiror in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow
Fund, from the Company Stockholders pro rata solely to the extent of each
Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Share (i.e., each Company Stockholder will be
liable solely for its Pro Rata Share of such excess Losses).

(e) For the sole purpose of determining Losses (and not for determining
whether or not any breaches of representations or warranties have occurred),
the representations and warranties of the Company shall not be deemed
qualified by any references to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.

11.3. Indemnification Rights of the Company Stockholders and the
Representative. After the Closing, the Company Stockholders and the
Representative and any of their affiliates, advisers and representatives
(collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") shall be entitled to be indemnified
and held harmless by Acquiror from and against all Losses suffered or incurred
by the Company Indemnitees arising from (a) any breach of any representation
or warranty of Acquiror or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which Acquiror or Merger Sub is a party, (b) any
failure to perform or observe any covenant or agreement of Acquiror or Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to which Acquiror
or Merger Sub is a party, or (c) any failure to perform or observe any
covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document to which it is a party to be performed entirely by the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time.

11.4. Third Party Claims. Except as set forth in the Special Indemnity Side
Letter or the Litigation Side Letter, any Person making a claim for
indemnification under Section 11.2 or Section 11.3 (the "Claimant") shall
promptly give notice to the Representative (if any Acquiror Indemnitee is the
Claimant) or Acquiror (if any Company Indemnitee is the Claimant) (an
"Indemnitor") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice
of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it,
describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the
basis thereof. The failure to give such written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations except to the extent
that the Indemnitor is prejudiced by reason of such failure. Indemnitor shall
be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to Claimant's claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense, and at its option shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Claimant to be the lead counsel in connection
with such defense; provided, that, such Indemnitor shall not have the right to
defend or direct the defense of any such claim that principally seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Claimant. If at any time
after assuming the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor determines in
good faith that it is not obligated to indemnify the Claimant with respect to
such claim, the Indemnitor may, or upon the demand of the Claimant, shall,
turn over the defense of the claim to the Claimant; provided, however, that in
the event that the Indemnitor does not turn over the defense of the claim to
the Claimant, the Indemnitor will indemnify the Claimant from and against the
entirety of any Losses the Claimant may suffer based upon, arising from or
relating to the claim. The Claimant shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at
the Claimant's expense; provided, that, if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Claimant there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Claimant that cannot be waived, the Indemnitor shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Claimant in each
jurisdiction for which the Claimant determines counsel is required. If the
Indemnitor elects not to defend a third party claim, fails to promptly notify
the Claimant in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement or fails to diligently prosecute

* * *





the defense of such third party claim, the Claimant may, subject to this
Section 11.4, pay, compromise, defend such third party claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such third party claim. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any
such claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim;
provided, that, the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Claimant (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Claimant or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Claimant from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice.
If the Claimant shall control the defense of any such claim pursuant to this
Section 11.4 then the Claimant shall be entitled to settle such claim;
provided, that, so long as the Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify the
Claimant for Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such claim
pursuant to this Article 11, the Claimant shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim. The Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders) shall
act on behalf of all Indemnitors in the case of all third party claims with
respect to which the Acquiror is seeking indemnification under Section 11.2.
If the Indemnitor makes any payment on any claim pursuant to Section 11.2, the
Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights
and remedies of the Claimant to any insurance benefits of the Claimant with
respect to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that
the procedures applicable to the Litigation are as set forth in the Litigation
Side Letter and the procedures relating to certain claims pursuant to Section
11.2(a)(vi) are as set forth in the Special Indemnity Side Letter.

11.5. Additional Limitations. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under Section 11.2 or Section 11.3 shall be calculated net of
any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by the Claimant from any third party with respect thereto,
provided that (a) the Claimant shall have no obligation to seek recovery under
any insurance policy issued to the Claimant or any of its Affiliates (other
than those issued with respect to the Company), (b) amounts actually recovered
by the Claimant under any insurance policy with respect to such Loss shall be
net of the cost of collection thereof and net of the cost of increased
premiums attributable to the claims associated with such recoveries, (c) any
obligation to seek insurance coverage shall not apply to any self-insurance
programs or policies, (d) no Party, under any circumstances, shall be
obligated to pursue litigation against the applicable insurer or other third
party, and (e) no party will pursue litigation against any customer or
supplier of the Surviving Corporation (provided, however, that a Party shall
take such steps as may be reasonably required to provide the other Party with
the right of subrogation to pursue any insurance coverage or other third party
reimbursements for third party claims, upon such other Party's request and at
such other Party's sole cost and expense). In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by any Claimant with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of any associated costs) shall be made
promptly to the Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders or
Acquiror, as applicable. In no event shall any Person be entitled to recover
or make a claim under Section 11.2 or Section 11.3 for any amounts in respect
of consequential or punitive damages.

11.6. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to
the Base Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
law.

11.7. Sole Remedy. After the Closing, the indemnification relief afforded by
the provisions of this Article 11, the Litigation Side Letter and the Special
Indemnity Side Letter and the equitable remedies permitted by Section 12.11
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of a Claimant for matters arising under
this Agreement and the performance hereof other than claims arising from fraud
on the part of a Party hereto

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
for tort, breach of contract or otherwise, and by agreeing to such provisions,
the Parties are deemed to have made an election of remedies in favor of
indemnification in lieu of other remedies. After the Closing, Acquiror may not
avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this Article 11 by seeking
damages for breach of contract except in the case of fraud; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 11.7 shall limit any Person's right to seek and
obtain any equitable or legal relief to which any Person shall be entitled or
to seek any remedy on account of any party's fraud. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party's right to seek any remedy on
account of any Party's fraud, whether for tort, breach of contract or
otherwise and whether based on the representations and warranties contained
herein, the other covenants, agreements or provisions contained herein or
otherwise, shall not be limited by the Survival Termination Date, shall not be
shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount or the Cap and shall not be used
in calculating whether the Deductible Amount or Cap has been met.

12. MISCELLANEOUS. 

12.1. Notices. All notices, demands and requests required or permitted to be
given under the provisions of this Agreement shall be (a) in writing; (b)
delivered by personal delivery, facsimile transmission (with telephonic
confirmation) or sent by commercial delivery service or certified mail, return
receipt requested; (c) deemed to have been given on the date of personal
delivery, facsimile transmission (with telephonic confirmation) or the date

invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party, such provision, as to such
jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

12.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts with the same effect as if the signature on each such counterpart
were upon the same instrument, and a facsimile or electronic transmission
shall be deemed to be an original signature.

12.11. Specific Performance. Each of the Parties to this Agreement
acknowledges that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are unique and recognizes and affirms that in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be
inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that such non-breaching Party shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at
law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other Party\'s obligations
hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action
or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security).

12.12. No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement constitutes an agreement
solely among the Parties, and is not intended to and will not confer any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities, legal or equitable on any Person
(including any employee or former employee of the Company) other than the
Parties and their respective successors or permitted assigns or otherwise
constitute any Person a third party beneficiary under or by reason of this
Agreement, except (a) the Acquiror Indemnitees and the Company Indemnitees,
solely with respect to Article 11, (b) the Surviving Corporation Indemnified
Persons, solely with respect to Section 6.13, and (c) the Company
Stockholders, solely with respect to Section 2.2(b), shall be intended third
party beneficiaries.

12.13. Public Announcement. Upon execution of this Agreement, Acquiror and the
Company may issue a press release approved by both parties announcing the
Merger. Prior to the publication of such initial and mutually agreed press
release, neither Party shall make any public announcement relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except as may be required
by law). The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to prevent any such
public announcement. After execution of this Agreement, Acquiror may issue
such press releases, and make such other public statements regarding the
Merger, as it reasonably determines are required under applicable Legal
Requirements or regulatory rules (including any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market) or otherwise in the best
interest of Acquiror. After execution of this Agreement, the Company shall not
issue any press release or make any public statement regarding the Merger or
Acquiror or Acquiror's business without first consulting with Acquiror
(including by providing Acquiror the opportunity to review and comment
thereon) and obtaining Acquiror's agreement to such press release or public
statement, except as the Company reasonably determines is required by
applicable Legal Requirements or after the termination of this Agreement.

12.14. Construction. This Agreement has been negotiated by the Parties and
their respective legal counsel, and legal or equitable principles that might
require the construction of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement
against the Party drafting this Agreement shall not apply in any construction
or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement (a) the headings are
included for ease of reference only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of the provisions of this Agreement, (b) the words
"hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder," and words of similar import may
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a specific section,
paragraph, or clause in which the respective word appears, (c) words importing
gender include the other gender as appropriate, (d) any terms defined in this
Agreement may, unless the context otherwise requires, be used in the singular
or the plural depending on the reference, (e) unless otherwise stated,
references to any Section, Article, Schedule or Exhibit are to such Section or
Article of, or Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement, (f) the words
"include", "includes", and "including" are deemed in each case to be followed
by the words "without limitation" and (g) the word "shall" denotes a directive
and obligation, and not an option. Any reference to any federal, state, local
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Disclosure of information included on any disclosure schedule (or portion of
any disclosure schedule) shall be considered disclosures for all other
disclosure schedules (or other portions of other disclosure schedules) to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is applicable to such other disclosure schedules (or other
portions of disclosure schedules). In addition, (i) the fact that any
disclosure on any schedule is not required to be disclosed in order to render
the applicable representation or warranty to which it relates true, or that
the absence of such disclosure on any schedule would not constitute a breach
of such representation or warranty, shall not be deemed or construed to expand
the scope of any representation or warranty hereunder or to establish a
standard of disclosure in respect of any representation or warranty and (ii)
disclosure of a particular matter on any schedule shall not be construed to
mean that such matter is material or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

12.15. Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege.

(a) Acknowledgment of Prior Representation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that Spencer Fane Britt and Browne LLP ("Spencer") has
acted as counsel to the Company, the Representative and the Company
Stockholders in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and in that connection
not as counsel for any other person, including Acquiror, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Consent to Future Representation. Acquiror and Merger Sub hereby consent
and agree to, and agree to cause the Surviving Corporation to consent and
agree to, Spencer representing the Representative and/or any of the Company
Stockholders (collectively, the "Seller Parties") after the Closing, including
with respect to disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be
directly adverse to Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation), and even though Spencer may have represented the Company in a
matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for the Company. Acquiror and Merger Sub further consent and agree to,
and agree to cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to consent and
agree to, the communication by Spencer to the Seller Parties in connection
with any such representation of any fact known to Spencer arising by reason of
Spencer's prior representation of the Company.

(c) Waiver of Conflicts. In connection with the foregoing, each of Acquiror
and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees
to cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates to irrevocably waive and
not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in

connection with (i) Spencer's prior representation of the Company and (ii)
Spencer's representation of the Representative and the Company Stockholders
prior to and after the Closing.

12.16. Acknowledgment of Acquiror and Merger Sub. Each of Acquiror and Merger
Sub acknowledges that it has relied on the representations and warranties of
the Company expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, including
the Schedules (and the Schedules Update) in making its determination to
proceed with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Each of Acquiror
and Merger Sub understands, acknowledges and agrees to the disclaimer set
forth in Section 4.26. In connection with the Acquiror's investigation of the
Company, the Acquiror has received certain future projections, including
future projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations
of the Company and certain future business plan information. Each of the
Acquiror and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such future estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, that each of Acquiror and Merger Sub is familiar with such
uncertainties and that each of Acquiror and Merger Sub is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all future estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished
to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such future
estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, each of Acquiror and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledges that the Company is not making any representation or
warranty with respect to such future estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such future estimates, projections and forecasts, and each of
Acquiror and Merger Sub hereby disclaims any reliance on such future
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans.
