shares of DFB Healthcare Common Stock and Consideration Units, as applicable,
received thereby as part of the Closing Merger Consideration, as applicable,
and as set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet:

 



 

(i) One Million (1,000,000) Consideration Units and shares of DFB Healthcare
Common Stock in the aggregate, in the event that the average Trading Price of
the DFB Healthcare Common Stock is $15.00 or greater during the month of
December in 2020 (the " _First Stock Target_ ") (such 1,000,000 shares, the "
_First Contingent Consideration_ ");

 



 

(ii) An additional one Million (1,000,000) Consideration Units and shares of
DFB Healthcare Common Stock in the aggregate, in the event that the average
Trading Price of the DFB Healthcare Common Stock is $18.00 or greater during
the month of December in 2021 (the " _Second Stock Target_ ") (such 1,000,000

(iii) An additional one Million (1,000,000) Consideration Units and shares of
DFB Healthcare Common Stock in the aggregate, in the event that the average
Trading Price of the DFB Healthcare Common Stock is $22.00 or greater during
the month of December in 2022 (the " _Third Stock Target_ " and, together with
the First Stock Target and Second Stock Target, the " _Stock Targets_ ") (such
1,000,000 shares, the " _Third Contingent Consideration_ " and together with
the First Contingent Consideration and Second Contingent Consideration, the "
_Contingent Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) If any of the Stock Targets set forth in _Section 2.03(a)_ shall have
been achieved, DFB Healthcare shall promptly notify the Company Unitholders
Representative of such achievement and, within fifteen (15) Business Days
following the achievement of the applicable Stock Target, DFB Healthcare shall
cause the applicable Contingent Consideration to be issued in accordance with
the instructions of the Company Unitholders Representative for distribution
to each Company Unitholder and any applicable Blocker Seller as specified in
the Payment Spreadsheet. If the Company Unitholders Representative believes
that any of the Stock Targets set forth in _Section 2.03(a)_ have been
achieved and DFB Healthcare does not notify the Company Unitholders
Representative of such achievement or cause the applicable Contingent
Consideration to be issued, the Company Unitholders Representative shall be
entitled to deliver a written notice of objection to DFB Healthcare within
thirty (30) Business Days following the last day of the month in which the
Company Unitholders Representative believes that such Stock Target was
achieved (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Company Unitholders
Representative delivered an Objection Notice, DFB Healthcare and the Company
Unitholders Representative shall, during the 30-day period following such
objection, negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement. If, upon completion
of such 30-day period, the Company Unitholders Representative and DFB
Healthcare are unable to reach agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause
an independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Company
Unitholders Representative and DFB Healthcare (the " _Independent Accountant_
") to review this Agreement and the disputed price and/ or dates for the
purpose determining whether such Stock Target was achieved; provided that
Independent Accountant may consider only those items as to which the Company
Unitholders Representative and DFB Healthcare have disagreed; provided,
further, that the Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. The Company Unitholders Representative and DFB Healthcare shall
require the Independent Accountant to deliver to them, as promptly as
practicable, its determination of whether such Stock Target was achieved. Such
determination will be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees and
expenses charged by the Independent Accountant in its determination of whether
such Stock Target was achieved shall be borne by the party who was
unsuccessful in such determination.

 



 

(c) In the event that a Change of Control of the Surviving Company or DFB
Healthcare occurs prior to the earlier of (i) the time when all Contingent
Consideration has been delivered to the Company Unitholders Representative
after the achievement of the Stock Targets and (ii) December 31, 2023, the
remaining portion of the applicable Contingent Consideration to be received
pursuant to _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.02(a)_ shall immediately vest and
the Company Unitholders and the applicable Blocker Sellers shall be entitled
to receive such applicable Contingent Consideration. For the purposes of this
Agreement, a " _Change of Control_ " shall have been deemed to occur with
respect to DFB Healthcare or the Surviving Company upon:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) the sale, lease, license, distribution, dividend or transfer, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, of 50% or more of the assets
of DFB Healthcare or the Surviving Company, as applicable, and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole;

 



 

(ii) a merger, consolidation or other business combination of DFB Healthcare
(or any subsidiary or subsidiaries that alone or together represent all or
substantially all of the consolidated business of DFB Healthcare at that time)
or any successor or other entity holding all or substantially all of the
assets of DFB Healthcare and its subsidiaries that results in the stockholders
of DFB Healthcare (or such subsidiary or subsidiaries) or any successor or
other entity holding all or substantially all of the assets of DFB Healthcare
and its subsidiaries or the surviving entity thereof, as applicable,
immediately before the consummation of such transaction or series of related
transactions holding, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the voting
power of DFB Healthcare (or such subsidiary or subsidiaries) or any successor,
other entity or surviving entity thereof, as applicable, immediately following
the consummation of such transaction or series of related transactions; or

 



 

(iii) any person or "group" (within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under
the Exchange Act as in effect on the Closing Date) shall obtain beneficial
ownership (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of the
voting stock of DFB Healthcare representing more than 50% of the voting power
of the capital stock of DFB Healthcare entitled to vote for the election of
directors of DFB Healthcare.

 



 

(d) The Contingent Consideration and the Stock Targets shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into DFB Healthcare Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to DFB Healthcare Common Stock, occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the time any such Contingent Consideration is
delivered to the Company Unitholders and applicable Blocker Sellers, if any.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Limited Liability Company Interest Transfer Books_. At the
Effective Time, the limited liability company interest transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Membership Units thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Membership
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Company Membership Units, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Law. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 2.04_ shall not affect the limited liability company interest
transfer books of the Surviving Company, the holders of Consideration Units or
any rights with respect thereto.

 



 

SECTION 2.05 _Payment Spreadsheet_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to DFB Healthcare, a schedule
setting forth the Merger Consideration (which shall include the breakdown of
Closing Stock Consideration and Contingent Consideration for each Company
Unitholder, and the breakdown of the BM Blocker Merger Closing Consideration,
the A Blocker Merger Closing Consideration and Contingent Consideration for
each Blocker Seller) payable to the Company Unitholders and the Blocker

 



     

 

 



 

Sellers (the " _Payment Spreadsheet_ "). The allocation of the Merger
Consideration among the Company Unitholders and the Blocker Sellers shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of the Company LLC Agreement
governing the allocation of such consideration (unless any Company Unitholder
or Blocker Seller provides its written consent to a different basis of
determination); _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
any Blocker, such Merger Consideration shall be payable to the applicable
Blocker Seller. The sum of (i) the number of shares of DFB Healthcare Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the Blocker Mergers at Closing as provided in
_Section 2.01(a)_ and _(b)_ as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet and (ii)
the number of Consideration Units issuable to the Company Unitholders at
Closing pursuant to the Merger as provided in _Section 2.02_ and as set forth
on the Payment Spreadsheet shall be equal to (A) the Aggregate Merger Closing
Consideration Amount _divided by_ (B) $10.00. The allocation of the Merger
Consideration set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet shall be binding on all
parties and shall be used by DFB Healthcare and Merger Sub for purposes of
issuing the Merger Consideration to the Blocker Sellers and the Company
Unitholders pursuant to this _Article II_. In issuing the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_, DFB Healthcare and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to rely fully on the allocation of the Merger Consideration
set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet.

SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to each person who is an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing (a " _Continuing Employee_
"), for the period beginning on the Closing Date, and ending on December 31,
2020, or, in each case, if earlier, on the date of the termination of
employment of the relevant Continuing Employee (the " _Continuation_

 



      

 

 



 

 _Period_ "), DFB Healthcare shall provide each such Continuing Employee with
(i) a base salary or base wage rate and incentive compensation and commission
opportunities (excluding equity compensation opportunities) that are no less
favorable to the Continuing Employees base salary or base wage rate and
incentive compensation and commission opportunities (excluding equity
compensation opportunities) in effect for such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) with employee retirement, health,
welfare and other material fringe benefits (excluding any defined benefit
pension plans and equity compensation plans) that are substantially similar,
in the aggregate, to those being provided or made available to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing under the Plans. Further, DFB
Healthcare shall, or shall cause the Company, to provide each Continuing
Employee whose employment is terminated during the Continuation Period with
severance payments and benefits at least equal to the severance payments and
benefits such Continuing Employee was eligible to receive as of immediately
prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and, with respect
to the determination of the level or amount of (i) benefits for the
Continuation Period and (ii) vacation and severance pay for the Continuation
Period, benefit accrual under the benefit and compensation plans, programs,
agreements and arrangements of DFB Healthcare, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates (the " _DFB Healthcare Plans_ ") in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing, other than any
retiree medical plan, equity compensation plan and/or defined benefit plan,
DFB Healthcare, the Company or their respective subsidiaries shall credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit
for such service under any similar Plan, except where such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits. DFB Healthcare shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all DFB Healthcare Plans that are group health plans to the extent
coverage under such DFB Healthcare Plan replaces coverage under a
substantially similar Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before such replacement to the extent such waiting time was met
under such Plan. For purposes of each DFB Healthcare Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, DFB
Healthcare shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such DFB Healthcare Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
requirements were met or not applicable under the corresponding Plan, and DFB
Healthcare shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Closing Date to be taken into account under such DFB Healthcare Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such DFB Healthcare Plan.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.05_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.05_ shall
constitute or be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time
for, or preclude the ability of DFB Healthcare or the Company (or any of their
affiliates) to terminate, any Continuing Employee, other employee or

 



     

 

 



 

other service provider for any reason, (ii) confer upon any person (including
any current or former director, officer or employee of, or consultant or
independent contractor to, DFB Healthcare or the Company) any third party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies, (iii) establish, amend or modify any
DFB Healthcare Plan, Plan, or any or any other "employee benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the Company, the DFB
Healthcare, or any of their respective affiliates, or (iv) alter or limit the
ability of the DFB Healthcare and its subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company and its Company Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any DFB Healthcare Plan, Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 7.06 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall request
from each person (each, a " _Disqualified Individual_ ") to whom any payment
or benefit is required or proposed to be made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could constitute "parachute
payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (" _Section 280G Payments_")
execute a waiver agreement providing that such Disqualified Individual has
waived his or her right to receive some or all of such payment or benefit (the
" _Waived Benefits_ "), to the extent necessary so that all remaining payments
and benefits applicable to such Disqualified Individual shall not be deemed a
parachute payment, and accepting in substitution for the Waived Benefits the
right to receive the Waived Benefits if and only if approved by the
stockholders of the Company in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. In connection with the foregoing, DFB Healthcare
shall provide the Company with all information reasonably necessary to allow
the Company to determine whether any payments made or to be made or benefits
granted or to be granted pursuant to any Contract entered into or negotiated
by DFB Healthcare or its affiliates (" _DFB Healthcare Payments_ "), together
with all Section 280G Payments, could reasonably be considered to be
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code at
least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (and shall further
provide any such updated information as is reasonably necessary prior to the
Closing Date). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit the Waived
Benefits of each Disqualified Individual who has executed a waiver in
accordance with this _Section 7.06_ for approval of the Companys
stockholders and such Disqualified Individuals right to receive the Waived
Benefits shall be conditioned upon receipt of the requisite approval by the
Companys stockholders in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code; _provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section 7.06_ be
construed to require the Company (or any of its affiliates) to compel any
Disqualified Individual to waive any existing rights under any Contract or
agreement that such Disqualified Individual has with any of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any other person and in no event shall the Company (or
any of its affiliates) be deemed in breach of this _Section 7.06_ if any such
Disqualified Individual refuses to waive any such rights or it the
stockholders fail to approve any Waived Benefits. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 7.06_ or otherwise in this Agreement, to the
extent DFB Healthcare has provided inaccurate information, or DFB Healthcares
omission of information has resulted in inaccurate information, with respect
to any DFB Healthcare Payments, there shall be no breach of the covenant
contained herein to the extent caused by such inaccurate or omitted
information. The Company shall provide DFB Healthcare and its counsel with a
copy of the Section 280G calculations, as well as any waiver agreement, the
disclosure statement and the stockholder consent contemplated by this _Section
7.06_ within a reasonable time prior to delivery to each Disqualified
Individual and the stockholders of the Company of such waiver agreement,
disclosure statement and stockholder consent,

 



     

 

 



 

respectively, and the Company shall consider in good faith any changes
reasonably requested by DFB Healthcare or its counsel. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall, to the extent that the Company receives waivers from
any Disqualified Individual, deliver to DFB Healthcare and its counsel
evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.06_ with respect
to the Waived Benefits pursuant to such waiver and that either (a) the
requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company was obtained with
respect to such Waived Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (b) the 280G
Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, such Waived Benefits shall
not be made or provided.

 



 

SECTION 7.07 _Managers  and Officers Indemnification_. The certificate of
formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
advancement and reimbursement of expenses than are set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company LLC Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Effective Time, were managers, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be
required by law.

 



 

SECTION 7.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to DFB Healthcare, and DFB Healthcare shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which could reasonably be expected to cause
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ to not be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.08_

good faith any comments that are provided by DFB Healthcare not less than ten
(10) days prior to such due date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
of a dispute between the parties as to the preparation of the BM Prepared Tax
Return, such dispute shall be promptly submitted for arbitration to a mutually
acceptable "big 4" accounting firm, or if no such firm accepts the engagement,
an accounting firm mutually acceptable to the parties (the " _Arbitrator s
Determination_"). If the Arbitrators Determination is not made prior to the
due date for filing a BM Prepared Tax Return, such return will be filed
reflecting the BM Blocker Sellers position and shall be subsequently amended
as needed to reflect the Arbitrators Determination. The BM Blocker Sellers
shall severally (and not jointly) be responsible for paying their pro rata
share of any Taxes shown as due on each BM Prepared Tax Return, which payment
shall be made to DFB Healthcare not more than two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date for payment, or, in the event of an Arbitrators Determination,

SECTION 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or
otherwise).

 



 

SECTION 10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Transactions) in the
Delaware Chancery Court or, if that court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

SECTION 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 7.07_ (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons).

 



 

SECTION 10.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court, or if such court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction, any court of the United States located
in the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware

 



     

 

 



 

Chancery Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not
be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 



 

SECTION 10.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section
10.09_.

 



 

SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

SECTION 10.12 _Company Unitholders  Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Company Unitholders Representative is hereby approved to serve as the
representative of the Company Unitholders with respect to the matters
expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Company
Unitholders Representative. Each of the Company Unitholders have irrevocably
appointed the Company Unitholders Representative as the agent, proxy and
attorney in fact for such Company Unitholders for the matters expressly set
forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Company Unitholders
Representative. All decisions and actions by the Company Unitholders
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Company Unitholders, and no
Company Unitholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. DFB Healthcare and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
rely on the actions taken by the Company Unitholders Representative without
independent inquiry into the capacity of the Company Unitholders
Representative to so act. All actions, notices, communications and
determinations by the Company Unitholders Representative to carry out such
functions shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall
be binding upon, the Company Unitholders.

 



 

(b) The Company Unitholders Representative may resign from its position as
Company Unitholders Representative at any time by written notice delivered to
the Company Unitholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of
the Company Unitholders

 



     

 

 



 

Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote
of the Company Unitholders.

 



 

(c) All acts of the Company Unitholders Representative hereunder in its
capacity as such shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Company
Unitholders and not of the Company Unitholders Representative individually.
The Company Unitholders Representative shall not have any liability for any
amount owed to DFB Healthcare pursuant to this Agreement. The Company
Unitholders Representative shall not be liable to the Company, DFB
Healthcare, Merger Sub, or any other person in his or its capacity as the
Company Unitholders Representative, for any liability of a Company Unitholder
or otherwise, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement. The Company Unitholders Representative shall
not be liable to the Company Unitholders, in his, her or its capacity as the
Company Unitholders Representative, for any liability of a Company Unitholder
or otherwise, or for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or
omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake in fact or Law, or for
anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this
Agreement, except in the case of the Company Unitholders Representatives
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Company
Unitholders Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event
of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of
this Agreement or its duties or rights hereunder, and it shall incur no
liability in its capacity as the Company Unitholders Representative to DFB
Healthcare, Merger Sub, the Company, or the Company Unitholders and shall be
fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in
good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Company
Unitholders Representative shall not by reason of this Agreement have a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Company Unitholder, except in respect
of amounts received on behalf of the Company Unitholders.

 



 

(d) The Company may apportion up to $500,000 in the Payment Spreadsheet to the
Company Unitholders Representative (the " _Company Unitholders 
Representative Amount_") as an Expense of the Company to pay any fees, costs,
expenses or other obligations incurred by the Company Unitholders
Representative acting in its capacity as such; provided, that the Company
Unitholders Representative Amount shall be released to the Company
Unitholders and the Blocker Sellers pro rata following the date of
determination of the Third Stock Target. Without limiting the foregoing, each
Company Unitholder shall indemnify and defend the Company Unitholders
Representative and hold the Company Unitholders Representative harmless
against any loss, damage, cost, liability or expense actually incurred without
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Company Unitholders
Representative (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction) and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance, performance or administration of the Company Unitholders
Representatives duties under this Agreement. Any expenses or taxable income
incurred by the Company Unitholders Representative in connection with the
performance of its duties under this Agreement shall not be the personal
obligation of the Company Unitholders Representative but shall be payable by
and attributable to the Company Unitholders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company Unitholders Representative shall be
entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid or
non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied liabilities incurred by the Company
Unitholders Representative in connection with the performance of its duties
hereunder from amounts actually delivered to the Company Unitholders

 



     

 

 



 

Representative pursuant to this Agreement. The Company Unitholders
Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to the Company
Unitholders covering such expenses and liabilities, which shall be paid by the
Company Unitholders promptly following the receipt thereof.

 **EXHIBIT A**

 



 

 **Registration Rights Agreement**

 



 

 **[See Attached]**

      

 

 



 

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT**

 



 

This REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of [*],
2019, by and among (i) AdaptHealth Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), (ii) AdaptHealth Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Pubco_ "), (iii) each of the Persons listed on the Schedule of
Investors attached hereto as of the date hereof, and (iv) each of the other
Persons set forth from time to time on the Schedule of Investors who, at any
time, own securities of the Company or Pubco and enter into a joinder to this
Agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms hereof (each Person identified in
the foregoing (iii) and (iv), an " _Investor_ " and, collectively, the "
_Investors_ "). Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Section 12_ hereof.

 



 

WHEREAS, Pubco and certain of the Investors (the " _Original Holders_ ") are
parties to that certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of February
15, 2018 (the " _Prior Agreement_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Original Holders currently hold an aggregate of 6,250,000 shares
(the " _Founder Shares_ ") of Common Stock issued prior to Pubcos initial
public offering;

 



 

WHEREAS, one of the Original Holders currently holds an aggregate of 4,333,333
warrants (the " _Private Placement Warrants_ ") to purchase, at an exercise
price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment), shares of Common Stock;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company and Pubco have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of July 8, 2019 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which, on the date hereof, DFB Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, has merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company surviving the Merger as a partially-owned subsidiary of Pubco;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates an "Up-C" structure such that,
following the Merger, certain Investors(1) will hold Common Units that will be
exchangeable for Common Stock of Pubco;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of the Merger
Agreement, Pubco and one of the Investors have entered into a Subscription
Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2019 (the " _Subscription Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which, on the date hereof, such Investor has purchased an
aggregate of [*] shares of Common Stock (the " _PIPE Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties to the Prior Agreement desire to terminate the Prior
Agreement and to provide for the terms and conditions included herein and to
include the recipients of the other Registrable Securities identified herein.

  (1) NTD: All holders of existing Company Common Units that will hold
Surviving Company Common Units or DFB Healthcare Common Stock following the
closing shall be entitled to sign this Agreement.

     

 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Resale Shelf Registration Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable Securities_. Pubco
shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed with the Commission, no later than thirty (30) days
following the consummation of the Merger (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), a
Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the resale from time to
time by the Investors of all of the Registrable Securities held by the
Investors (the " _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf
Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 (" _Form S-3_") or, if Form S-3
is not then available to Pubco, on Form S-1 or such other appropriate form
permitting Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by such
Investors. Pubco shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible after
filing, but in no event later than the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days
following the Filing Deadline or (ii) ten (10) Business Days after the
Commission notifies Pubco that it will not review the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement, if applicable (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ ");
provided, that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90)
days after the filing deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by,
and receives comments from, the Commission. Once effective, Pubco shall use
reasonable best efforts to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective and to be supplemented and amended to the extent
necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, to ensure that another Registration Statement is available, under
the Securities Act at all times until such date as all Registrable Securities
covered by the Shelf Resale Registration Statement have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution set forth in such
Registration Statement or such securities have been withdrawn (the "
_Effectiveness Period_ "). The Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall
contain a Prospectus in such form as to permit any Investor to sell such
Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any
successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) at
any time beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement
(subject to lock-up restrictions provided in this Agreement and in the Lock-Up
Agreements), and shall provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold
pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and
requested by, the Investors.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this _Section
1_, in the event the Commission informs Pubco that all of the Registrable
Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered
for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration statement, Pubco
agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the holders thereof and use its
reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and file a new registration statement (a " _New
Registration Statement_ "), on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is not then available
to Pubco for such registration statement, on such other form available to
register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering;
provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration
Statement, Pubco shall be obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to
advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the Registrable
Securities

 



     

 

 



 

in accordance with any publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments,
requirements or requests of the Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "),
including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number of Registrable
Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement
as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that Pubco used diligent efforts
to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater
number of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a
holder as to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities
to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata
basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the
Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Investors
must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by
such Investors. In the event Pubco amends the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under
clauses (i) or (ii) above, Pubco will use its reasonable best efforts to file
with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance
provided to Pubco or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to register
for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration
Statement.

 



 

(c) Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 1_ shall not be counted
as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2_.

 



 

2. _Demand Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Requests for Registration_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and of the Lock-Up Agreements, at any time or from time to time, the
holders of Registrable Securities may request registration under the
Securities Act of all or any portion of their Registrable Securities on Form
S-1 or any similar long-form registration statement (" _Long-Form
Registrations_") or, if available, on Form S-3 (including a shelf registration
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act) or any similar short-form
registration statement, including an automatic shelf registration statement
(as defined in Rule 405) (an " _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement_ "), if
available to Pubco (" _Short-Form Registrations_") in accordance with
_Section 2(b)_ and _Section 2(c)_ below (such holders being referred to
herein as the " _Initiating Investors_ " and all registrations requested by
the Initiating Investors being referred to herein as " _Demand Registrations_
"). Each request for a Demand Registration shall specify the approximate
number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered and the intended
method of distribution. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of any
such request, Pubco shall give written notice of such requested registration
to all other holders of Registrable Securities and, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, shall include in such registration (and in all
related registrations and qualifications under state blue sky laws or in
compliance with other registration requirements and in any related
underwriting) all such Registrable Securities with respect to which Pubco has
received written requests for inclusion therein within five (5) Business Days
after the receipt of Pubcos notice. Each holder of Registrable Securities
agrees that such holder shall treat as confidential the receipt of the notice
of Demand Registration and shall not disclose or use the information contained
in such notice of Demand Registration without the prior written consent of

 



     

 

 



 

Pubco until such time as the information contained therein is or becomes
available to the public generally, other than as a result of disclosure by the
holder in breach of the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Long-Form Registrations_. The Investors holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities may request one (1) Long-Form Registration in which
Pubco shall pay all Registration Expenses whether or not any such Long-Form
Registration has become effective; provided that, Pubco shall not be obligated
to effect, or to take any action to effect, any Long-Form Registration unless
the aggregate market price of the Registrable Securities requested to be
registered in such Long-Form Registration exceeds $20,000,000 at the time of
request; provided, further, that Pubco shall only be obligated to effect, or
take any action to effect, one (1) Long-Form Registration. A registration
shall not count as the sole permitted Long-Form Registration until it has
become effective and unless the holders of Registrable Securities are able to
register and sell at least 90% of the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration; provided that in any event Pubco shall pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with any registration initiated as a Long-
Form Registration whether or not it has become effective and whether or not
such registration has counted as one of the permitted Long-Form Registrations
hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Short-Form Registrations_. In addition to the Long-Form Registration
provided pursuant to _Section 2(b)_, each of (i) the Investors holding a
majority of the Common Units not held by Pubco, (ii) the Investors holding a
majority of the Founder Shares and (iii) the Investors holding a majority of
the PIPE Shares shall be entitled to request an unlimited number of Short-Form
Registrations in which Pubco shall pay all Registration Expenses whether or
not any such Short-Form Registration has become effective; provided, however,
that Pubco shall not be obligated to effect any such Short-Form Registration:
(i) if the holders of Registrable Securities, together with the holders of any
other securities of Pubco entitled to inclusion in such Short-Form
Registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities with an aggregate market
price at the time of request of less than $5,000,000, or (ii) if Pubco has,
within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of such request,
already effected three (3) Short-Form Registrations for the holders of
Registrable Securities requesting a Short-Form Registration pursuant to this
_Section 2(c)_. Demand Registrations shall be Short-Form Registrations
whenever Pubco is permitted to use any applicable short form registration and
if the managing underwriters (if any) agree to the use of a Short-Form
Registration. For so long as Pubco is subject to the reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act, Pubco shall use its reasonable best efforts to make Short-
Form Registrations available for the offer and sale of Registrable Securities.
If Pubco is qualified to and, pursuant to the request of the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities, has filed with the Commission a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule
415 (a " _Shelf Registration_ "), then Pubco shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as soon as practicable after filing, and, if Pubco is a WKSI at
the time of any such request, to cause such Shelf Registration to be an
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, and once effective, Pubco shall cause
such Shelf Registration to remain effective (including by filing a new Shelf
Registration, if necessary) for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the date
on which all Registrable Securities included in such registration have been
sold or distributed pursuant to the Shelf Registration or (ii) the date as of
which all of the Registrable Securities included in such registration are able
to be sold within a 90-day period in compliance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. If for any reason Pubco ceases to be a WKSI or becomes
ineligible to utilize Form

 



     

 

 



 

S-3, Pubco shall prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement
or registration statements on such form that is available for the sale of
Registrable Securities.

 



 

(d) _Shelf Takedowns_. At any time when the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or a Shelf Registration for the sale or distribution by holders of
Registrable Securities on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415,
including by way of an underwritten offering, block sale or other distribution
plan (each, a " _Resale Shelf Registration_ ") is effective and its use has
not been otherwise suspended by Pubco in accordance with the terms of _Section
2(f) _below, upon a written demand (a " _Takedown Demand_ ") by any Investor
that is, in either case, a Shelf Participant holding Registrable Securities at
such time (the " _Initiating Holder_ "), Pubco will facilitate in the manner
described in this Agreement a "takedown" of Registrable Securities off of such
Resale Shelf Registration (a " _take down offering_ ") and Pubco shall pay all
Registration Expenses in connection therewith; provided that Pubco will
provide (x) in connection with any non-marketed underwritten takedown offering
(other than a Block Trade), at least two (2) Business Days notice of such
Takedown Demand to each holder of Registrable Securities (other than the
Initiating Holder) that is a Shelf Participant, (y) in connection with any
Block Trade initiated prior to the three (3) year anniversary of the
consummation of the Merger, notice of such Takedown Demand to each holder of
Registrable Securities (other than the Initiating Holder) that is a Shelf
Participant no later than noon Eastern time on the Business Day prior to the
requested Takedown Demand and (z) in connection with any marketed underwritten
takedown offering, at least five (5) Business Days notice of such Takedown
Demand to each holder of Registrable Securities (other than the Initiating
Holder) that is a Shelf Participant. In connection with (x) any non-marketed
underwritten takedown offering initiated prior to the three (3) year
anniversary of the consummation of the Merger and (y) any marketed
underwritten takedown offering, if any Shelf Participants entitled to receive
a notice pursuant to the preceding sentence request inclusion of their
Registrable Securities (by notice to Pubco, which notice must be received by
Pubco no later than (A) in the case of a non-marketed underwritten takedown
offering (other than a Block Trade), the Business Day following the date
notice is given to such participant, (B) in the case of a Block Trade, by
10:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date notice is given to such participant and
(C) in the case of a marketed underwritten takedown offering, three (3)
Business Days following the date notice is given to such participant), the
Initiating Holder and the other Shelf Participants that request inclusion of
their Registrable Securities shall be entitled to sell their Registrable
Securities in such offering. Each holder of Registrable Securities that is a
Shelf Participant agrees that such holder shall treat as confidential the
receipt of the notice of a Takedown Demand and shall not disclose or use the
information contained in such notice without the prior written consent of
Pubco until such time as the information contained therein is or becomes
available to the public generally, other than as a result of disclosure by the
holder in breach of the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Priority on Demand Registrations and Takedown Offerings_. Pubco shall not
include in any Demand Registration that is an underwritten offering any
securities that are not Registrable Securities without the prior written
consent of the managing underwriters and the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities then outstanding. If a Demand Registration or a
takedown offering is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriters
advise Pubco in writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable
Securities and, if permitted hereunder, other securities requested to be
included in such offering exceeds the number of Registrable Securities and
other securities, if any, which can be sold in an orderly manner in such
offering within a price

 



     

 

 



 

range acceptable to the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
held by Initiating Investors, Pubco shall include in such offering prior to
the inclusion of any securities which are not Registrable Securities the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration (pro rata
among the holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities owned by each such holder).

 



 

(f) _Restrictions on Demand Registrations and Takedown Offerings_. Any demand
for the filing of a registration statement or for a registered offering
(including a takedown offering) hereunder will be subject to the constraints
of any applicable lock-up arrangements to which any demanding Investor is
party, and any such demand must be deferred until such lock-up arrangements no
longer apply.

 



 

(i) Pubco shall not be obligated to effect any Demand Registration within 30
days prior to Pubcos good faith estimate of the date of filing of an
underwritten public offering of Pubcos securities and for such a period of
time after such a filing as the managing underwriters request, provided that
such period shall not exceed 90 days from the effective date of any such
underwritten public offering. Pubco may postpone, for up to 60 days from the
date of the request (the " _Suspension Period_ "), the filing or the
effectiveness of a registration statement for a Demand Registration or suspend
the use of a prospectus that is part of any Resale Shelf Registration (and
therefore suspend sales of the Registrable Securities included therein) by
providing written notice to the holders of Registrable Securities if the board
of directors of Pubco reasonably determines in good faith that the offer or
sale of Registrable Securities would be expected to have a material adverse
effect on any proposal or plan by Pubco or any subsidiary thereof to engage in
any material acquisition or disposition of assets or stock (other than in the
ordinary course of business) or any material merger, consolidation, tender
offer, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction or would
require Pubco to disclose any material nonpublic information which would
reasonably be likely to be detrimental to Pubco and its subsidiaries; provided
that in such event, the holders of Registrable Securities initially requesting
such Demand Registration or Takedown Demand shall be entitled to withdraw such
request. Pubco may delay or suspend the effectiveness of a Demand Registration
or takedown offering pursuant to this _Section 2(f)(i) _only once in any
consecutive twelve-month period; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
Pubco may in any event delay or suspend the effectiveness of Demand
Registration or takedown offering in the case of an event described under
_Section 5(g)_ to enable it to comply with its obligations set forth in
_Section 5(f)_. Pubco may extend the Suspension Period for an additional
consecutive 60 days with the consent of the Applicable Approving Party.

 



 

(ii) In the case of an event that causes Pubco to suspend the use of any
Resale Shelf Registration as set forth in _Section 2(f)(i)_ or pursuant to
_Section 5(g)_ (a " _Suspension Event_ "), Pubco shall give a notice to the
holders of Registrable Securities registered pursuant to such Shelf
Registration (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") to suspend sales of the Registrable
Securities and such notice shall state generally the basis for the notice and
that such suspension shall continue only for so long as the Suspension Event
or its effect is continuing. A holder of Registrable Securities shall not
effect any sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Resale Shelf
Registration (or such filings) at any time after it

 



     

 

 



 

has received a Suspension Notice from Pubco and prior to receipt of an End of
Suspension Notice (as defined below). Each holder of Registrable Securities
agrees that such holder shall treat as confidential the receipt of the
Suspension Notice and shall not disclose or use the information contained in
such Suspension Notice without the prior written consent of Pubco until such
time as the information contained therein is or becomes available to the
public generally, other than as a result of disclosure by such holder in
breach of the terms of this Agreement. The holders of Registrable Securities
may recommence effecting sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Resale Shelf Registration (or such filings) following further written notice
to such effect (an " _End of Suspension Notice_ ") from Pubco, which End of
Suspension Notice shall be given by Pubco to the holders of Registrable
Securities and to such holders counsel, if any, promptly following the
conclusion of any Suspension Event.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if Pubco shall
give a Suspension Notice with respect to any Resale Shelf Registration
pursuant to this _Section 2(f)_, Pubco agrees that it shall extend the period
of time during which such Resale Shelf Registration shall be maintained
effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period
from the date of receipt by the holders of the Suspension Notice to and
including the date of receipt by the holders of the End of Suspension Notice
and provide copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus necessary to
resume sales, with respect to each Suspension Event; provided that such period
of time shall not be extended beyond the date that Common Stock covered by
such Resale Shelf Registration are no longer Registrable Securities.

 



 

(g) _Selection of Underwriters_. In connection with any Demand Registration,
the Applicable Approving Party shall have the right to select the investment
banker(s) and manager(s) to administer the offering; provided that such
selection shall be subject to the written consent of Pubco, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If any takedown offering
is an underwritten offering, the Applicable Approving Party shall have the
right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer such
takedown offering. In each case, the Applicable Approving Party shall have the
right to approve the underwriting arrangements with such investment banker(s)
and manager(s) on behalf of all holders of Registrable Securities
participating in such offering. All Investors proposing to distribute their
securities through underwriting shall (together with Pubco and the Company)
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for such underwriting.

 



 

(h) _Other Registration Rights_. Pubco represents and warrants to each holder
of Registrable Securities that the registration rights granted in this
Agreement do not conflict with any other registration rights granted by Pubco.
Except as provided in this Agreement, Pubco shall not grant to any Persons the
right to request Pubco to register any equity securities of Pubco, or any
securities, options or rights convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for such securities, without the prior written consent of the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding.

 



 

(i) _Revocation of Demand Notice or Takedown Notice_. At any time prior to the
effective date of the registration statement relating to a Demand Registration
or the "pricing"

 



     

 

 



 

of any offering relating to a Takedown Demand, the holders of Registrable
Securities that requested such Demand Registration or takedown offering may
revoke such request for a Demand Registration or takedown offering on behalf
of all holders of Registrable Securities participating in such Demand
Registration or takedown offering without liability to such holders of
Registrable Securities, in each case by providing written notice to Pubco.

 



 

3. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. Whenever Pubco proposes to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act (other than (i) pursuant to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement, (ii) pursuant to a Demand Registration, (iii)
pursuant to a Takedown Demand, (iv) in connection with registrations on Form
S-4 or S-8 promulgated by the Commission or any successor forms, (v) a
registration relating solely to employment benefit plans, (vi) in connection
with a registration the primary purpose of which is to register debt
securities, or (vii) a registration on any form that does not include
substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a
registration statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities) and the
registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Registrable
Securities (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), Pubco shall give prompt written
notice to all holders of Registrable Securities of its intention to effect
such a Piggyback Registration and, subject to the terms of _Sections 3(c)
_and 3 _(d)_ hereof, shall include in such Piggyback Registration (and in all
related registrations or qualifications under blue sky laws or in compliance
with other registration requirements and in any related underwriting) all
Registrable Securities with respect to which Pubco has received written
requests for inclusion therein within 10 business days after the delivery of
Pubcos notice; provided that any such other holder may withdraw its request
for inclusion at any time prior to executing the underwriting agreement or, if
none, prior to the applicable registration statement becoming effective.

 



 

(b) _Piggyback Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of the holders of
Registrable Securities shall be paid by Pubco in all Piggyback Registrations,
whether or not any such registration became effective.

 



 

(c) _Priority on Primary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration is an
underwritten primary registration on behalf of Pubco, and the managing
underwriters advise Pubco in writing that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number of
securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability, proposed offering price, timing or method of distribution of
the offering, Pubco shall include in such registration (i) first, the
securities Pubco proposes to sell, (ii) second, the Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration by the Investors which, in the
opinion of such underwriters, can be sold, without any such adverse effect
(pro rata among the holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder), and (iii) third,
other securities requested to be included in such registration which, in the
opinion of such underwriters, can be sold, without any such adverse effect.

 



 

(d) _Priority on Secondary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration is an
underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of Pubcos securities
other than holders of Registrable Securities, and the managing underwriters
advise Pubco in writing that in their opinion the number of securities
requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number

 



     

 

 



 

of securities which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting
the marketability, proposed offering price, timing or method of distribution
of the offering, Pubco shall include in such registration (i) first, the
securities requested to be included therein by the holders initially
requesting such registration, (ii) second, the Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration by the Investors which, in the
opinion of such underwriters, can be sold, without any such adverse effect
(pro rata among the holders of such Registrable Securities on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities owned by each such holder), and (iii) third,
other securities requested to be included in such registration which, in the
opinion of such underwriters, can be sold, without any such adverse effect.

 



 

(e) _Other Registrations_. If Pubco has previously filed a registration
statement with respect to Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 2_ or
pursuant to this _Section 3_, and if such previous registration has not been
withdrawn or abandoned, then Pubco shall not be required to file or cause to
be effected any other registration of any of its equity securities or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for its equity
securities under the Securities Act (except on Form S-8 or any successor form)
at the request of any holder or holders of such securities until a period of
at least 90 days has elapsed from the effective date of such previous
registration.

 



 

(f) _Right to Terminate Registration_. Pubco shall have the right to terminate
or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this _Section 3_ whether
or not any holder of Registrable Securities has elected to include securities
in such registration. The Registration Expenses of such withdrawn registration
shall be borne by Pubco in accordance with _Section 7_.

 



 

4. _Agreements of Holders_.

 



 

(a) If required by the managing underwriter(s), in connection with any
underwritten Public Offering on or after the date hereof, each holder that
beneficially owns 1% or more of the outstanding Common Stock shall enter into
lock-up agreements with the managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten
Public Offering in such form as agreed to by such managing underwriter(s).

 



 

(b) The holders of Registrable Securities shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide such information as may reasonably be requested by Pubco, or the
managing underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any
Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in order
to effect the Registration Statement, including amendments and supplements
thereto, in order to effect the Registration of any Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to _Section 3_ and in connection with
Pubcos obligation to comply with federal and applicable state securities
laws.

 



 

5. _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the Registration to be effected pursuant to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, and whenever the holders of Registrable Securities have requested that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to this Agreement or have initiated a takedown offering, Pubco shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto Pubco shall as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

 



     

 

 



 

(a) prepare in accordance with the Securities Act and all applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and file with the Commission a registration
statement, and all amendments and supplements thereto and related prospectuses
as may be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, with respect to
such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective (provided that at least five (5)
Business Days before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto, Pubco shall furnish to counsel selected by
the Applicable Approving Party copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed, which documents shall be subject to the review and comment of such
counsel);

 



 

(b) notify each holder of Registrable Securities of (A) the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any registration
statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (B) the
receipt by Pubco or its counsel of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose, and (C) the effectiveness of each registration statement filed
hereunder;

 



 

(c) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective for a period
ending when all of the securities covered by such registration statement have
been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of distribution by
the sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement (but not in any
event before the expiration of any longer period required under the Securities
Act or, if such registration statement relates to an underwritten Public
Offering, such longer period as in the opinion of counsel for the underwriters
a prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sale of
Registrable Securities by an underwriter or dealer) and comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such registration statement during such period in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set
forth in such registration statement;

 



 

(d) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities thereunder such number of
copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto,
the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus), each Free-Writing Prospectus and such other documents
as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition
of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller;

 



 

(e) during any period in which a prospectus is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, promptly file all documents required to be filed with the
Commission, including pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
Securities Act;

 



 

(f) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions
as the lead underwriter or the Applicable Approving Party reasonably requests
and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller (provided
that Pubco shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in
any jurisdiction where it would

 



      

 

 



 

not otherwise be required to qualify but for this _Section 5(f)_, (ii)
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii)
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction);

 



 

(g) promptly notify in writing each seller of such Registrable Securities (i)
after it receives notice thereof, of the date and time when such registration
statement and each post-effective amendment thereto has become effective or a
prospectus or supplement to any prospectus relating to a registration
statement has been filed and when any registration or qualification has become
effective under a state securities or blue sky law or any exemption thereunder
has been obtained, (ii) after receipt thereof, of any request by the
Commission for the amendment or supplementing of such registration statement
or prospectus or for additional information, and (iii) at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus
included in such registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and, at the request of any such seller, Pubco promptly shall
prepare, file with the Commission and furnish to each such seller a reasonable
number of copies of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;

 



 

(h) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange on which similar securities issued by Pubco are then listed and, if
not so listed, to be listed on a securities exchange and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to
register as such with respect to such Registrable Securities with FINRA;

 



 

(i) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities
not later than the effective date of such registration statement;

 



 

(j) enter into and perform such customary agreements (including underwriting
agreements in customary form) and take all such other actions as the
Applicable Approving Party or the underwriters, if any, reasonably request in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities
(including, without limitation, effecting a stock split or a combination of
shares and preparing for and participating in such number of "road shows",
investor presentations and marketing events as the underwriters managing such
offering may reasonably request);

 



 

(k) make available for inspection by any seller of Registrable Securities, any
underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration
statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such
seller or underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
and business documents and properties of Pubco as shall be necessary to enable
them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause Pubcos
officers, managers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and
independent accountants to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with
such registration statement;

 



 

(l) take all reasonable actions to ensure that any Free-Writing Prospectus
utilized in connection with any Demand Registration (including any Shelf
Registration) or Piggyback Registration hereunder complies in all material
respects with the Securities Act, is filed

 



     

 

 



 

in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby, is
retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby
and, when taken together with the related prospectus, shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;

 



 

(m) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission;

 



 

(n) permit any holder of Registrable Securities who, in its good faith
judgment (based on the advice of counsel), could reasonably be expected to be
deemed to be an underwriter or a controlling Person of Pubco to participate in
the preparation of such registration or comparable statement and to require
the insertion therein of material furnished to Pubco in writing, which in the
reasonable judgment of such holder and its counsel should be included;

 



 

(o) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus or suspending the qualification
of any Common Stock included in such registration statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, Pubco shall use its reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain
the withdrawal of such order;

 



 

(p) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by
such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable
the sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(q) cooperate with the holders of Registrable Securities covered by the
registration statement and the managing underwriter or agent, if any, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing
any restrictive legends) representing securities to be sold under the
registration statement and enable such securities to be in such denominations
and registered in such names as the managing underwriter, or agent, if any, or
such holders may request;

 



 

(r) cooperate with each holder of Registrable Securities covered by the
registration statement and each underwriter or agent participating in the
disposition of such Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in
connection with any filings required to be made with FINRA;

 



 

(s) if such registration includes an underwritten public offering, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a cold comfort letter from Pubcos
independent public accountants and addressed to the underwriters, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by cold comfort
letters as the underwriters in such registration reasonably request;

 



 

(t) provide a legal opinion of Pubcos outside counsel, dated the effective
date of such registration statement (and, if such registration includes an
underwritten Public Offering, dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement), with respect to the registration

 



     

 

 



 

statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included
therein (including the preliminary prospectus) and such other documents
relating thereto in customary form and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by legal opinions of such nature, which opinion shall be
addressed to the underwriters;

 



 

(u) if Pubco files an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement covering any
Registrable Securities, use its reasonable best efforts to remain a WKSI (and
not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405)) during the period
during which such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement is required to remain
effective;

 



 

(v) if Pubco does not pay the filing fee covering the Registrable Securities
at the time an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement is filed, pay such fee
at such time or times as the Registrable Securities are to be sold; and

 



 

(w) subject to the terms of _Section 2(c)_ and _Section 2(d)_, if an
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement has been outstanding for at least three
(3) years, at the end of the third year, refile a new Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities, and, if at any
time when Pubco is required to re-evaluate its WKSI status Pubco determines
that it is not a WKSI, use its reasonable best efforts to refile the
registration statement on Form S-3 and keep such registration statement
effective (including by filing a new Resale Shelf Registration or Shelf
Registration, if necessary) during the period throughout which such
registration statement is required to be kept effective.

 



 

6. _Termination of Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right of any Investor to include Registrable Securities in any Demand Registration or any Piggyback Registration shall terminate on such date that such Investor (together with its affiliates) beneficially owns less than 1% of the outstanding Common Stock and may sell all of the Registrable Securities owned by such Investor pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act without any restrictions as to volume or the manner of sale or otherwise; provided, however, that with respect to any Investor whose rights have terminated pursuant to this _Section 6_, if following such a termination, such Investor loses the ability to sell all of its Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act without any restrictions as to volume or the manner of sale or otherwise due to a change in interpretive guidance by the Commission, then such Investors right to include Registrable Securities in any Demand Registration or any Piggyback Registration shall be reinstated until such time as the Investor is once again able to sell all of its Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act without any restrictions as to volume or the manner of sale or otherwise.

 



 

7. _Registration Expenses_.

 



 

(a) All expenses incident to Pubcos performance of or compliance with this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all registration, qualification and
filing fees, listing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or
blue sky laws, stock exchange rules and filings, printing expenses, messenger
and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians, and fees and
disbursements of counsel for Pubco and all independent certified public
accountants, underwriters (excluding underwriting discounts and commissions)
and other Persons retained by Pubco (all such expenses being herein called "
_Registration Expenses_ "), shall be borne by Pubco

 



     

 

 



 

as provided in this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, Pubco also
shall pay all of its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expense of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by Pubco are then listed. Each Person that sells securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration, a Takedown Demand or Piggyback Registration
hereunder shall bear and pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and
transfer taxes applicable to the securities sold for such Persons account.

 



 

(b) Pubco shall reimburse the holders of Registrable Securities included in
such registration for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel
chosen by the Applicable Approving Party and one local counsel (if necessary)
for each applicable jurisdiction and chosen by the applicable holder of
Registrable Securities, in each case, for the purpose of rendering a legal
opinion on behalf of such holders in connection with any underwritten Demand
Registration, takedown offering or Piggyback Registration.

 



 

8. _Additional Payments Under Certain Circumstances_.

 



 

(a) Payments (" _Additional Payments_ ") with respect to the shares of Common
Stock included in the Registrable Securities shall be assessed as follows if
any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (ii)
below being herein called a " _Registration Default_ "):

 



 

(i) the Resale Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by
the Effectiveness Deadline; or

 



 

(ii) the Resale Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the
Commission but thereafter ceases to be effective prior to the expiration of
the Effectiveness Period (unless and except to the extent that another
Registration Statement covering the applicable Registrable Securities is
effective during the Effectiveness Period).

 



 

(b) Additional Payments shall accrue on the applicable Registrable Securities
for each such day from and including the date on which any such Registration
Default occurs to but excluding the date on which all such Registration
Defaults have been cured at a rate of $0.05 per share (subject to
proportionate adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split
or other recapitalization) per month or portion thereof (on a 30/360 basis);
provided, however, that the Companys obligation to pay Additional Payments
extends only to any shares of Common Stock included in the Registrable
Securities that are affected by the Registration Default; and provided further
that Additional Payments shall in no event accrue on account of any
Registrable Securities during any period that such Registrable Securities may
not be sold pursuant to the terms of the Lock-Up Agreements or any other
applicable lock-up arrangements to which the applicable Investor is party.
Other than the obligation of payment of any Additional Payments in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Company will have no other liabilities for monetary
damages with respect to its registration obligations. With respect to each
Investor, the Companys obligations to pay Additional Payments remain in
effect only so long as the applicable shares of Common Stock held by the
Investor are Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) in no event shall the aggregate of all Additional
Payments payable by the

 



     

 

 



 

Company hereunder on account of any share of Common Stock exceed $0.50 per
share (subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of any stock split,
reverse stock split or other recapitalization), (ii) no Additional Payments
shall accrue during any Suspension Period, (iii) a Registration Default shall
be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing, and no Additional Payments
shall accrue as a result thereof, if the Registration Default relates to any
information supplied or failed to be supplied by an Investor in relation to
any Registration Statement or the related Prospectus. No Additional Payments
shall be payable (i) if as of the relevant Registration Default, the
Registrable Securities may be sold by the Investors without volume or manner
of sale restrictions under Rule 144, as determined by counsel to the Company
pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and reasonably
acceptable to the Companys transfer agent or (ii) with respect to any period
after the expiration of the Effectiveness Period (it being understood that
this clause shall not relieve the Company of any Additional Payments accruing
prior to the expiration of the Effectiveness Period).

 



 

(c) Any amounts of Additional Payments pursuant to this _Section 8_ will be
payable in cash in arrears on the last day of each month following the date on
which a Registration Default occurs. The amount of Additional Payments will be
determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months,
and the actual number of days on which Additional Payments accrued during such
period.

 



 

9. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Pubco agrees to (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each Investor and their respective officers, directors,
members, partners, agents, affiliates and employees and each Person who
controls such Investor (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act) against all losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities and
expenses caused by (A) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, or (B) any violation or alleged
violation by Pubco of the Securities Act or any other similar federal or state
securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to
Pubco and relating to action or inaction required of Pubco in connection with
any such registration, qualification or compliance, and (ii) pay to each
Investor and their respective officers, directors, members, partners, agents,
affiliates and employees and each Person who controls such Investor (within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act), as incurred, any legal
and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating,
preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action,
except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information
furnished in writing to Pubco or any managing underwriter by such Investor
expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this _Section 9_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such settlement is
effected without the consent of Pubco (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor shall Pubco be liable in any such case
for any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action to the extent that it
solely arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the registration statement or omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent that such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was

 



     

 

 



 

made in the registration statement, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by such Investor expressly for use in connection
with such registration statement. In connection with an underwritten offering,
Pubco shall indemnify any underwriters or deemed underwriters, their officers
and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of
Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to
Pubco in writing such information relating to such holder as Pubco reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or
prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify Pubco, its
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and each Person who
controls Pubco (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but
only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any
information so furnished in writing by such holder; provided that the
obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each
holder and shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds actually received by
such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
registration statement.

 



 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall
not impair any Persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such
failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless
in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such
claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(as well as one local counsel for each applicable jurisdiction) for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of
interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. In such instance, the
conflicted indemnified parties shall have a right to retain one separate
counsel, chosen by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
included in the registration, at the expense of the indemnifying party. No
indemnifying party, in the defense of such claim or litigation, shall, except
with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification
provisions contemplated by _Sections 9(a)_ or _9(b)_ are unavailable to or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying
such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact,
relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified
party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 9(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
holders or any underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 9(d)_. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or, except as provided in _Section 9(c)_, defending any such action or claim.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
sellers obligations in this _Section 9(d)_ to contribute shall be several in
proportion to the amount of securities registered by them and not joint and
shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by
such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to such
registration.

 



 

(e) The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
Person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of Registrable
Securities and the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 



 

10. _Participation in Underwritten Registrations_. No Person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (including, without limitation, pursuant to any over-allotment or "green shoe" option requested by the underwriters; provided that no holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to sell more than the number of Registrable Securities such holder has requested to include) and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody agreements, stock powers, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; provided that no holder of Registrable Securities included in any underwritten registration shall be required to make any representations or warranties to Pubco or the underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such holder, such holders title to the securities, such Persons authority to

 



     

 

 



 

sell such securities and such holders intended method of distribution) or to
undertake any indemnification obligations to Pubco or the underwriters with
respect thereto that are materially more burdensome than those provided in
_Section 9_. Each holder of Registrable Securities shall execute and deliver
such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by Pubco and the lead
managing underwriter(s) that are consistent with such holders obligations
under _Section 4_, _Section 5_ and this _Section 10_ or that are necessary
to give further effect thereto. To the extent that any such agreement is
entered into pursuant to, and consistent with, _Section 4_ and this _Section
10_, the respective rights and obligations created under such agreement shall
supersede the respective rights and obligations of the holders, Pubco and the
underwriters created pursuant to this _Section 10_.

 



 

11. _Other Agreements_. Pubco shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and shall take such further action as the Investors may reasonably request, all to the extent required to enable such Persons to sell securities pursuant to (a) Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time) or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission or (b) a registration statement on Form S-3 or any similar registration form hereafter adopted by the Commission.

shall be entitled to specific performance and/or other injunctive relief from
any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction (without posting any bond

invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder
of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
counterparts (including by means of telecopied, facsimile or portable data
format (PDF) signature pages), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of
this Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean "including

any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. The parties hereto

or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any Delaware Chancery
Court, or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any court
of the United States located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court.

(it being understood that (i) upon exchange of Exchangeable Units for Class A
Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, such Class A Common Stock
would be issued together with any such corresponding right and (ii) in the
event such rights to purchase equity securities of Pubco are triggered, Pubco
will ensure that the holders of Common Units that have not been Exchanged
prior to such time will be treated equitably vis-a-vis the holders of Class A
Common Stock under such plan).

 



 

(c) At any time a holder of Exchangeable Units exchanges such Units for shares
of Class A Common Stock or a Cash Payment, the Company shall cancel such
Exchangeable Units. Upon the cancellation by the Company of the Exchangeable
Units exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock, the Manager shall cause
the Company to issue a number of Common Units equal to the Net Exchanged Unit
Amount, registered in the name of Pubco in accordance with Section 2.6 of the
Exchange Agreement.

 



 

(d) If at any time Pubco issues one or more shares of Class A Common Stock in
connection with an equity incentive program, whether such share or shares are
issued upon exercise (including cashless exercise) of an option, settlement of
a restricted stock unit, as restricted stock or otherwise, the Manager shall
cause the Company to issue a corresponding number of Common Units, registered
in the name of Pubco (determined based upon the Exchange Rate then in effect);
provided that Pubco shall be required to contribute all (but not less than
all) of the net proceeds (if any) received by Pubco from or otherwise in
connection with such issuance of one or more shares of Class A Common Stock,
including the exercise price of any option exercised, to the Company. If any
such shares of Class A Common Stock so issued by Pubco in connection with an
equity incentive program are subject to vesting or forfeiture provisions, then
the Common Units that are issued by the Company to Pubco in connection
therewith in accordance with the preceding provisions of this _Section
2.9(d)_) shall be subject to vesting or forfeiture on the same basis; if any
of such shares of Class A Common Stock vest or are forfeited, then a
corresponding number of the Common Units (determined based upon the Exchange
Rate then in effect) issued by the Company in accordance with the preceding
provisions of this _Section 2.9(d)_) shall automatically vest or be
forfeited. Any cash or property held by Pubco or the Company or on any of such
Persons behalf in respect of dividends paid on restricted shares of Class A
Common Stock that fail to vest shall be returned to the Company upon the
forfeiture of such restricted shares of Class A Common Stock.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) Pubco shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon an
Exchange, the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall be
issuable upon Exchange of all outstanding Common Units and shares of Class B
Common Stock; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed to
preclude Pubco from satisfying its obligations in respect of any such Exchange
by delivery of purchased shares of Class A Common Stock (which may or may not
be held in the treasury of Pubco or cash in lieu of shares of Class A Common
Stock in the amount provided by the Exchange Agreement). If any shares of
Class A Common Stock require registration with or approval of any governmental
authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be issued upon
an Exchange, Pubco shall use reasonable efforts to cause the exchange of such
shares of Class A Common Stock to be duly registered or approved, as the case
may be. Pubco shall list and use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
listing of the Class A Common Stock required to be delivered upon any such
Exchange prior to such delivery upon the national securities exchange upon
which the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are listed at the time of
such Exchange (it being understood that any such shares may be subject to
transfer restrictions under applicable securities laws). Pubco covenants that
all shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon an Exchange will, upon
issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this _Section 2.9_, "net proceeds" means gross proceeds
to Pubco from the issuance of Class A Common Stock or other securities less
all reasonable bona fide out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Pubco, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries actually incurred in connection with such
issuance.

 



 

(g) The Company shall undertake all actions with respect to the Common Units,
to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the number of Common Units
owned by Pubco, directly or indirectly, and the number of outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock, disregarding, for purposes of maintaining the one-to-
one ratio, (i) options, rights or securities of Pubco authorized under the
Companys existing equity incentive plan that are convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock (except to the extent the
net proceeds from such other securities, including any exercise or purchase
price payable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof, has been
contributed by Pubco to the equity capital of the Company), (ii) treasury
stock or (iii) preferred stock or other debt or equity securities (including
without limitation warrants, options or rights) issued by Pubco that are
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock
(except to the extent the net proceeds from such other securities, including
any exercise or purchase price payable upon conversion, exercise or exchange
thereof, has been contributed by Pubco to the equity capital of the Company).

 



 

(h) From and after the Effective Date to the extent required by _Section
2.9(b)_, the Manager may authorize and create, and cause the Company to issue,
additional Units or other equity securities in the Company (including creating
preferred interests or other classes or series of securities having such
rights, preferences and privileges as determined by the Manager) solely to the
extent they are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to a class of equity
securities of Pubco; provided that, following the Effective Date, in each case
the Company shall not issue equity securities in the Company to any Person
unless such Person shall have executed a Joinder Agreement and all other
documents, agreements or instruments deemed necessary or desirable in the
discretion of the Manager.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 2.10. **_Repurchase or Redemption of Class A Common Stock_**. If, at
any time, any shares of Class A Common Stock are repurchased or redeemed
(whether automatically or by means of another arrangement) by Pubco for cash,
then the Manager shall cause the Company, immediately prior to such repurchase
or redemption of such shares, to redeem a corresponding number of Common Units
held by Pubco (determined based upon the Exchange Rate then in effect), at an
aggregate redemption price equal to the aggregate purchase or redemption price
of the share or shares of Class A Common Stock being repurchased or redeemed
by Pubco (plus any reasonable expenses related thereto) and upon such other
terms as are the same for the share or shares of Class A Common Stock being
repurchased or redeemed by Pubco.

 



 

SECTION 2.11. **_Changes in Common Stock_**. In addition to any other
adjustments required hereby, any subdivision (by stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of Class A
Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or other capital stock of Pubco shall be
accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the
Common Units or other equity securities of the Company, as applicable.

 



 

SECTION 2.12. **_Title to Company Assets_**. All Company assets shall be
deemed to be owned by the Company as an entity, and no Holder, individually,
shall have any direct ownership interest in any Company assets. Each Holder,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby waives its rights to a
partition of the assets and, to that end, agrees that it will not seek or be
entitled to a partition of any assets, whether by way of physical partition,
judicial sale or otherwise, except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section
4.4_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III.** ** 
MANAGEMENT**

 



 

SECTION 3.1. **_Management_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or the Act,
the business, property and affairs of the Company shall be managed, operated
and controlled at the sole, absolute and exclusive direction of the Manager in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No Member shall have management
authority or voting or other rights over, or any other ability to take part in
the conduct or control of the business of, the Company. The Manager is hereby
designated as a "manager" within the meaning of Section 18-101(10) of the Act.
The Manager is, to the extent of its rights and powers set forth in this
Agreement, an agent of the Company for the purpose of the Companys business,
and the actions of the Manager taken in accordance with such rights and powers
shall bind the Company (and no Member shall have such right). The Manager
shall have all necessary powers to carry out the purposes, business and
objectives of the Company. The Manager may delegate in its discretion the
authority to sign agreements and other documents and take other actions on
behalf of the Company to any Person (including any Member, officer or employee
of the Company) to enter into and perform any document on behalf of the
Company.

 



 

(b) Without limiting _Section 3.1(a)_, the Manager shall have the sole power
and authority to effect any of the following by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in one or a series of related transactions, in each case without
the vote, consent or approval of any Member, unless

 



     

 

 



 

otherwise provided in this Agreement: (i) any sale, lease, transfer, exchange
or other disposition of any, all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company (including the exercise or grant of any conversion, option, privilege
or subscription right or any other right available in connection with any
assets at any time held by the Company); (ii) any merger, consolidation,
reorganization or other combination of the Company with or into another
entity, (iii) any acquisition; (iv) any issuance of debt or equity securities;
(v) any incurrence of indebtedness; or (vi) any dissolution. Except for any
vote, consent or approval of any Member expressly required by this Agreement,
if a vote, consent or approval of the Members is required by the Act or other
applicable law with respect to any action to be taken by the Company or matter
considered by the Manager, each Member will be deemed to have consented to or
approved such action or voted on such matter in accordance with the consent or
approval of the Manager on such action or matter.

 



 

(c) [Following the Effective Date, the Manager shall be elected annually by
the Members in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_, and the Manager so
elected shall serve as the Manager until a successor has been duly elected as
the Manager in accordance with this Section 3.1(c). Not more than one year
after the later of (a) the Effective Date and (b) the last meeting of the
Members or action by written consent of the Members at which or pursuant to
which the Manager was elected in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_, the
Manager at such time (or the Members if the Manager shall fail to take such
action) shall either (i) call and hold a meeting of the Members for purposes
of electing the Manager or (ii) seek written consents from the requisite
Members to elect the Manager pursuant to _Section 3.8_. A Person shall be
elected as the Manager if the election of such Manager is approved by Members
holding a majority of the outstanding Common Units by vote at a meeting held
for such purpose or by action by written consent; provided, however, that if
the Person so elected as the Manager was not the Manager immediately prior to
such election, such election shall not be effective, and such Person shall not
become the Manager, unless and until such Person has executed and delivered to
the Company the written agreement of such Person to be bound by the terms of
this Agreement applicable to the Manager, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Manager serving immediately prior to such election or to
the Members holding a majority of the outstanding Common Units.](1) [Pubco may
withdraw as the Manager and appoint as its successor at any time upon written
notice to the Company (i) any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Pubco, (ii) any
Person of which Pubco is a wholly-owned Subsidiary, (iii) any Person into
which Pubco is merged or consolidated or (iv) any transferee of all or
substantially all of the assets of Pubco, which withdrawal and replacement
shall be effective upon the delivery of such notice. No appointment of a
Person other than Pubco (or its successor, as the case may be) as Manager
shall be effective unless Pubco (or its successor, as the case may be) and the
new Manager provide all Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable
by such Members against the new Manager, to cause the new Manager to comply
with all of the Managers obligations under this Agreement.](2)

 



 

(d) [The Manager may resign as the Manager at any time and may be removed at
any time, with or without cause, by the Members holding a majority of the
outstanding Common Units by vote at a meeting of the Members held for such
purpose or by action by written consent; provided, however, that no (i) such
resignation or removal shall be effective until a successor Manager has been
duly elected in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_, and (ii) Pubco shall not
resign

Common Units at Closing.

 

(2) NTD: This language to be included if Manager holds less than a majority
of Common Units at Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

as the Manager for so long as it is a Member. If for any reason a Manager
ceases to serve as the Manager prior to the election of a successor Manager in
accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_, Pubco shall automatically, and without any
action of the Company or any Member, become the Manager and serve as the
Manager until another Person is duly elected as the Manager in accordance with
_Section 3.1(c)_.](3)

 



 

(e) [(d)] No Member or Manager in its capacity as such shall receive any fees
or other compensation (whether in the form of cash or equity or other
interests in the Company) for services rendered by it, him or her in the
management of the Companys business (other than pursuant to any employment
agreement or arrangement with any Manager or Member who is also an employee of
the Company). The Company shall reimburse the Manager (and its employees, if
any, and officers) for reasonable expenses incurred and paid by any of them in
their capacity as Manager (or employees or officers thereof), including, but
not limited to, telephone expenses, travel expenses incurred in connection
with meeting, and any other out-of-pocket expenditures attributable to the
Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.2. **_Officers_**.

 



 

(a) _Designation and Appointment_. The Manager may, from time to time, employ
and retain Persons as may be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the
Companys business (subject to the supervision and control of the Manager),
including employees, agents and other Persons who may be designated as
Officers of the Company with such titles as shall be determined by the
Manager. Any number of offices may be held by the same Person. In its
discretion, the Manager may choose not to fill any office for any period as it
may deem advisable. Any Officers so designated shall have such authority and
perform such duties as the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to them.
Each Officer shall hold office for such time as shall be designated by the
Manager.

 



 

(b) _Resignation/Removal_. Any Officer may resign as such at any time. Such
resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect at the time
specified therein, or if no time is specified, at the time of its receipt by
the Manager. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective, unless expressly so provided in the resignation. Any Officer may be
removed as such, either with or without cause at any time by the Manager,
subject to the terms and conditions of any employment agreement to which such
Officer is a party with the Company or any Subsidiary. Designation of an
Officer shall not of itself create any contractual or employment rights.

 



 

(c) _Duties of Officers Generally_. The Officers, in the performance of their
duties as such, shall owe to the Company duties of loyalty and due care of the
type owed by the officers of a corporation to such corporation and its
stockholders under the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

SECTION 3.3. **_Indemnification and Exculpation by the Company_**.

 



 

(a) No Mandatory Indemnitee shall, in his or her capacity as such, be liable
to

  (3) NTD: This language to be included only if Manager holds a majority of
Common Units at Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

the Company or any other Member for any expenses, damages, liabilities, costs
or losses arising out of the performance of his, her or its duties as a
Mandatory Indemnitee, other than those expenses, damages, liabilities, costs
or losses arising out of or attributable to such Persons Uncovered Act. No
Member shall be personally liable for any debts, liabilities or obligations of
the Company by reason of such Members status as a Member, whether to the
Company, any Member or to the creditors of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Manager and each Member and their respective Affiliates and
each of its and their respective officers, directors, management committee
members, trustees, partners or members, as the case may be, (" _Mandatory
Indemnitees_ ") and may indemnify and hold harmless each of the Officers,
employees or agents of the Company (" _Permitted Indemnitees_ " and
collectively with the Mandatory Indemnitees, the " _Covered Persons_ "), from
and against any and all judgments, interest on such judgments, fines,
penalties, charges, costs, amounts paid in settlement, expenses and reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in connection with any action, claim, suit, inquiry,
proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the foregoing by or before any
court or governmental, administrative or other regulatory agency, body or
commission, whether pending or threatened, and whether or not a Covered Person
is or may be a party thereto, which arise out of the business or affairs of
the Company or their activities with respect thereto (" _Indemnified Damages_
"), except for any such Indemnified Damages (i) that are taxes imposed on or
against any Holder and any Affiliate thereof, (ii) that have resulted
primarily from gross negligence, fraud, bad faith, deceit, wrongful taking or
self-dealing, willful misconduct, willful breach of this Agreement, or knowing
violation of law by the Covered Person, (iii) that have resulted primarily
from activities in breach of this Agreement or from ultra vires acts, (iv) in
connection with any proceeding by or in right of the Company in which such
Covered Person was adjudged liable to the Company or (v) in connection with
any proceeding charging improper personal benefit to such Covered Person
(whether or not involving action in an official capacity) in which such person
was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received
(clauses (i) through (v), the " _Uncovered Acts_ "). Any repeal or
modification of any portion of the foregoing provisions of this _Section
3.3(a)_ or the adoption of any provision of this Agreement inconsistent with
any portion of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of any person indemnified under this
_Section 3.3(a)_ for any act or omission occurring, or any cause of action,
suit, claim or other matter arising or accruing, prior to the effective date
of such repeal, modification or adoption. This _Section 3.3(a)_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other provisions for indemnification, or advancement
of expenses in connection with such indemnification of Members, Manager,
directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, partners and fiduciaries
that may be included in any statute or is approved by the Manager or the
Members.

 



 

(c) Expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered
Person in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company authorized in this _Section 3.3_. In addition, any
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Covered Person in
enforcing the right to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 3.3 _shall
be paid by the Company upon a determination primarily in favor of such Covered
Person.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Covered
Person against any liability asserted against such Covered Person and incurred
by such Covered Person in any such capacity, or arising out of such Covered
Persons status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(e) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this _Section 3.3_ shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to
maintain the status which caused such Person to be a Covered Person and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
Covered Person.

 



 

(f) The rights of any Person to indemnification as provided herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such Person may now or at any
time be entitled under applicable law, including without limitation, this
Agreement, any other agreement, a resolution of the Manager or any committee
thereof, any liability insurance policy of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof or otherwise.

 



 

(g) The Company hereby acknowledges that certain of the Covered Persons may
have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or
insurance provided by other parties, employers or other Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Secondary Indemnitors_ "). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 3.3_, the Members and the Company hereby agree
that if the Company has an indemnification obligation under this Agreement or
pursuant to any other agreement: (i) the Company is the indemnitor of first
resort (i.e., the Companys obligations to the Covered Persons are primary and
any obligation of the Secondary Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Covered
Persons are secondary), (ii) the Company shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by the Covered Persons and shall be liable for the
full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement by or on behalf of any such Covered Person to the extent legally
permitted and as required by this Agreement (or any agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and one or more of the Covered Persons, on the other
hand), without regard to any rights the Covered Persons may have against the
Secondary Indemnitors, and (iii) the Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes
and releases the Secondary Indemnitors from any and all claims against the
Secondary Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. The Members further agree that no advancement or
payment by the Secondary Indemnitors on behalf of any Covered Person with
respect to any claim for which such Covered Person has sought indemnification
from the Company shall affect the foregoing, and the Secondary Indemnitors
shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Covered Person
against the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.4. **_Directors and Officers Insurance_**. The Company shall procure
directors and officers liability insurance for the protection of the Manager,
Officers and other applicable representatives of the Company provided that
such insurance is available on commercially reasonable terms.

 



 

SECTION 3.5. **_Nature of Obligations between Members_**. Except as otherwise

 



     

 

 



 

expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute any Member an agent or legal representative of any other Member
or to create any fiduciary relationship for any purpose whatsoever, apart from
such obligations between members of a limited liability company as may be
created under the Act. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, a Member shall not have any authority to act for, or to assume any
obligation or responsibility on behalf of, any other Member or the Company.

 



 

SECTION 3.6. **_Business Opportunities_**. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to restrict in any way the rights of any Member or of any Affiliate
thereof (collectively, the " _Institutional Representatives_ "), to conduct
any other business or activity whatsoever (including, without limitation, in
any business that is competitive with the Company or any business that might
be considered an opportunity of the Company), whether presently existing or
hereafter created. No Institutional Representative shall be accountable to the
Company or to any Member with respect to that business or activity, and the
organization of the Company shall be without prejudice to the Institutional
Representatives rights to maintain, expand, exploit or diversify such other
interests and activities of such opportunities, and to receive and enjoy
profits or compensation therefrom. Each Member waives any rights such Member
might otherwise have to share or participate in such other interests,
activities or opportunities of any Institutional Representative. Subject to
the foregoing, the Manager has fiduciary duties to the Company and the Members
that are equivalent to the fiduciary duties owed by directors of a corporation
incorporated in the State of Delaware to such corporation and its
stockholders.

 



 

SECTION 3.7. **_[Voting_**.

 



 

(a) Meetings of the Members may be called by the Manager and shall be called
by the Manager upon the written request of Members holding at least 25% of the
outstanding Common Units. Such request shall state the location of the meeting
and the nature of the business to be transacted at the meeting. Written notice
of any such meeting shall be given to all Members not less than two Business
Days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of such meeting. Members may vote
in person, by proxy or by telephone at any meeting of the Members and may
waive advance notice of such meeting. Whenever the vote or consent of Members
is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or consent may be
given at a meeting of the Members or may be given in accordance with the
procedure prescribed in this _Section 3.7_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Members holding a
majority of the outstanding Common Units shall constitute the act of the
Members.

 



 

(b) Each Member may authorize any Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on
all matters in which such Member is entitled to participate, including waiving
notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. Every proxy
must be signed by such Member or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid
after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise
provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the
Member executing it.

 



 

(c) Each meeting of Members shall be conducted by an Officer designated by the
Manager or such other individual person as the Manager deems appropriate.

 



 

(d) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members may be taken

 



     

 

 



 

without a meeting if the requisite Members whose approval is necessary consent
thereto in writing.] (4)

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV.** ** 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS**

 



 

SECTION 4.1. **_Capital Contributions_**. The Members have made, or shall be
deemed to have made, the initial Capital Contributions to the Company as set
forth in the books and records of the Company. Except as set forth in _Section
2.12_, no Holder shall be entitled to make any additional Capital
Contributions without the approval of the Manager or required to make any
additional Capital Contributions without such Holders express written
agreement.

 



 

SECTION 4.2. **_Capital Accounts_**.

 



 

(a) _Creation_. There shall be established for each Holder on the books of the
Company a Capital Account that shall be increased or decreased in the manner
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Negative Balance_. A Holder shall not have any obligation to the Company
or to any other Holder to restore any negative balance in the Capital Account
of such Holder.

 



 

(c) _Current Balance_. The balance of each Holders Capital Account as of the
effective date of this Agreement is set forth on _Schedule B_ attached hereto.

 



 

SECTION 4.3. **_Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_**.

 



 

(a) _Timing and Amount of Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_. Net Income
and Net Loss of the Company shall be determined and allocated with respect to
each fiscal year of the Company as of the end of each such year or as
circumstances otherwise require or allow. After making the allocations (if
any) required by _Section 4.3(b)_, Net Income or Net Loss shall be allocated
among the Holders in such a manner that, as of the end of the period to which
the allocation relates, to the greatest extent possible, the Capital Account
of each Holder (determined after making all other adjustments provided for in
this Agreement through the close of such period) shall be equal to the
respective net positive amount (if any) that would be distributed to (or
reserved for) such Holder if the Company were then to sell all of its assets
for their Gross Asset Value, satisfy its liabilities and distribute its
remaining cash (if any) to the Holders in accordance with _Section 4.4(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Regulatory Allocations_. Provisions governing the allocation of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit (and items thereof) are hereby incorporated
by reference in this Agreement as may be necessary to provide that the
Companys allocation provisions contain a so-called "qualified income offset"
and comply with all provisions relating to the allocation of so-called
"nonrecourse deductions" and "partner nonrecourse deductions" and the
chargeback thereof as set forth in the Regulations under Section 704(b) of the
Code (any such allocations, " _Regulatory Allocations_ "). It is the intent of
the Members that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be
offset with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other
items of

  (4) NTD: This language to be included only if Manager holds a majority of
Common Units at Closing.

 



     

 

 



 

Company income, gain, loss, or deduction pursuant to this _Section 4.3(b)_.
Therefore, notwithstanding any other section of this Agreement, the Manager
shall make such offsetting special allocations of income, gain, loss, or
deduction in whatever manner is appropriate so that, after such offsetting
allocations are made, each Holders Capital Account balance is, to the extent
possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Holder would have had if
the Regulatory Allocations were not part of the Agreement. The Manager shall
elect to treat distributions of proceeds from a nonrecourse financing as not
allocable to an increase in "partnership minimum gain" to the extent permitted
by Regulation § 1.704-2(h)(3).

 



 

(c) _Allocations upon Transfer_. For any fiscal year during which a Holders
interest in the Company is assigned by such Holder, the portion of the Net
Income and Net Loss of the Company that is allocable in respect of such
Holders interest shall be apportioned between the assignor and the assignee
of such Holders interest using any permissible method under Code Section 706
and the Regulations thereunder, as determined by the Manager; provided,
however, that upon the admission of Pubco as a Member of the Company, the
books of the Company shall be closed in accordance with Section 706(d) of the
Code and consistent therewith (a) Net Income and Net Loss of the Company
recognized as of the date of such admission shall be allocated among the
Persons who were Holders prior to such date in accordance with this _Section
4.3_, and (b) Net Income and Net Loss recognized after such date shall be
allocated among the Persons who were Holders after such date in accordance
with this _Section 4.3_, in each case, as determined by the Manager.

 



 

(d) _Required Tax Allocations_. All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit for federal income tax purposes shall be allocated to each Holder in
the same manner as the Net Income or Net Loss (and each item of income, gain,
loss and deduction related thereto) that is allocated to such Holder pursuant
to _Section 4.3(a)_, _(b)_ and _(c)_ to which such tax items relate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.3_, income, gain,
loss, deduction, and credits with respect to property contributed or deemed
contributed to the Company by a Holder shall be allocated among the Holders
for federal and state income tax purposes pursuant to Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(c) of the Code, so as to take account of the variation, if
any, between the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes of the
property to the Company and its initial Gross Asset Value at the time of
contribution. In the event the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is
adjusted pursuant to the definition of Gross Asset Value, subsequent
allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credits with respect to such
asset shall take account of the variation, if any, between the adjusted basis
of such asset for federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in the
same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the applicable Regulations
consistent with the requirements of Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(g).
The allocations described in the two preceding sentences shall be made using
any reasonable method permitted under applicable Regulations, as determined by
the Manager. Allocations pursuant to this _Section 4.3(d)_ are solely for
purposes of federal, state and local income taxes and shall not affect, or in
any way be taken into account in computing, any Holders Capital Account or
share of Net Income or Net Loss. Allocations with respect to layers of Section
704(c) gain created prior to the date hereof will continue to be governed by
the versions of this Agreement that were in effect on the dates those layers
were created.

 



 

(e) _Holders  Tax Reporting_. The Holders acknowledge and are aware of the
income tax consequences of the allocations made by this _Section 4.3 _and,
except as may otherwise

 



      

 

 



 

be required by applicable law, hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of
_Section 4.3_ in reporting their shares of Company income, gain, loss,
deductions, and credits for federal, state and local income tax purposes.

 



 

(f) _Section 754 Elections_. The Company shall make an election under Section
754 of the Code (and any comparable state tax elections) on its tax returns
for the taxable year that includes the Effective Date, and shall also cause
any entities treated as partnerships for income tax purposes and in which it
owns a direct or indirect interest (other than solely through a subsidiary
corporation) to make such elections, if such entities do not already have such
elections already in effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.4. **_Distributions_**.

 



 

(a) _Timing and Amounts_. Subject to any other restrictions set forth in this
Agreement, Distributable Assets will be distributed to the Holders by the
Company at such times and in such amounts as is determined by the Manager;
provided that Tax Distributions shall be made at such times and in such
amounts as specified in _Section 4.4(c)_.

 



 

(b) _Priority of Distributions_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
4.4(b)_ and in _Section 4.4(c)_, _Section 4.4(d)_, and _Section 4.4(e)_,
distributions of Distributable Assets to the Holders of Units shall be
allocated among the Holders of Common Units pro rata; _provided_ , that the
amounts otherwise distributable to a Common Unit pursuant to this _Section
4.4(b)_ which is not vested (or not otherwise subject to vesting) shall not be
distributed (and shall be reserved by the Company) unless and until such time
as such Common Unit vests in accordance with its terms, at which time that
amount that would have been distributed but for this proviso shall be
distributed to the holder of such Common Unit; _provided further_ , however,
that in the event such Common Unit is forfeited to the Company in accordance
with its terms prior to the time such Common Unit vests, all such amounts that
would have been distributed but for the immediately preceding proviso shall be
redistributed in accordance with this _Section 4.4(b)_ as of the time of the
original distribution.

 



 

(c) _Tax Distributions_. Unless prohibited by law or by any loan document or
other creditor agreements, the Manager shall cause the Company to make a cash
distribution to each Holder on or before April 1 of each year in an amount
equal to (A) (i) the Taxable Income allocated to the Units held by such Holder
for the immediately preceding tax year, minus (ii) Tax Loss in excess of
Taxable Income, in each case, allocated to such Unit for all tax years prior
to such tax year, multiplied by (B) 45% (such amount determined in accordance
with the foregoing, whether or not actually distributed pursuant to this
_Section 4.4(c)_, a " _Tax Distribution_ "). The Company shall make quarterly
advances against the Tax Distributions throughout the year to provide the
Holders with cash to pay estimated taxes on the Taxable Income for the year,
based on a reasonable estimate (as determined by the Manager) of the Companys
Taxable Income for the year, and the amount of any such advances (or amounts
withheld in accordance with _Section 4.4(d)_) shall reduce the final Tax
Distribution to the applicable Holder. Tax Distributions distributed to
Holders pursuant to this Section 4.4(c) shall be treated as interest-free
advances on amounts otherwise distributable to a holder under this Agreement.
Solely for the purposes of any Tax Distribution pursuant to this _Section
4.4(c)_, all Common Units shall be treated as vested, whether such Common
Units are actually vested or not.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Withholding_. The Company is authorized to pay over to the appropriate
government authority with respect to the Holder of any Unit such amounts as is
required by the Code or any other provision of federal, state or local tax or
other law. Any amount so paid (or any amount withheld from distributions or
payments to the Company on account of the status of any Holder of any Unit
(or, if such Holder is fiscally transparent for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a direct or indirect beneficial owner of such Holder)) shall be
treated as a Tax Distribution to the Holder of such Unit for all purposes
under this Agreement. Promptly upon learning of any requirement under any
provision of the Code or any other applicable law requiring the Company to
withhold any sum from a distribution to a Holder or to make any payment to any
taxing authority in respect of such Holder, the Company shall give written
notice to such Holder of such requirement, and if practicable and if requested
by such Holder, shall cooperate with such Holder in all lawful respects to
minimize or to eliminate any such withholding or payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, any tax or other obligation attributable to tax payable by the Company
referred to in this _Section 4.4(d) _shall include without limitation, any
"imputed underpayment" imposed on the Company under Section 6225 of the Code
that is attributable to the Holder of any Unit (as determined by the Manager)
and any associated interest or penalties, and any taxes, interest or penalties
payable by the Company under any similar provisions of state or local tax
laws. The provisions of this _Section 4.4(d) _shall survive the dissolution
of the Company and the withdrawal of any Member or the transfer of any
Members Units.

 



 

(e) _Limitations on Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make a
distribution to any Holder on account of any Unit in the Company if such
distribution would violate (i) the Act or other applicable law or (ii) the
Credit Agreement.

the assets of the Company shall be distributed in the following manner and
order:

 



 

(i) _First_ , all debts and obligations of the Company, if any, shall first be

 **ARTICLE VI.** ** 
TRANSFERS**

 



 

SECTION 6.1. **_Transfers_**.

 



 

(a) _Transfers by Holders_. Subject to the other restrictions contained in
this Agreement, no Holder shall Transfer any Units without the written consent
of the Manager, which may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion,
except a Holder may, without Manager consent, make a Permitted Transfer. A "
_Permitted Transfer_ " means any Transfer by a Holder to any of the following

children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, and siblings or trust for the
benefit of any such individuals; (ii) to an Affiliate of such Holder, to such
Holders members if such person is a limited liability company, to such

the Units held thereby at any time, except to (i) any wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Pubco, (ii) any Person of which Pubco is a wholly-owned Subsidiary, (iii)
any Person into which Pubco is merged or consolidated or (iv) any transferee
of all or substantially all of the assets of Pubco, which withdrawal and
replacement shall be effective upon the delivery of such notice.

 



 

(c) _No Publicly Traded Partnership - Transfer Restrictions_. The Manager
shall prohibit any Transfer (and shall not recognize any Transfer) if such
Transfer would cause the Company to be treated as a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Transferees Bound_. Any Person who acquires in any manner whatsoever any
Unit, irrespective of whether such Person has accepted and adopted in writing
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be deemed by the acceptance
of the benefits of the acquisition thereof to have agreed to be subject to and
bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement that any
predecessor in such Unit in the Company was subject to or by which such
predecessor was bound.

 



 

(e) _Admission_. The Manager shall have the right to admit as a Member any
Person who acquires an interest in the Company, or any part thereof, from a
Member or from the Company and shall admit as a Member any Person acquiring
Units pursuant to a Permitted Transfer upon the transferees request and
transferees compliance with the provisions of _Section 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)_.
Concurrently with the admission of any additional Member, the Manager shall

 



     

 

 



 

forthwith cause any necessary papers to be filed and recorded and notice to be
given wherever and to the extent required showing the admission of such Person
as a Member, all at the expense, including payment of any professional and
filing fees incurred, of the new Member (unless otherwise approved by the
Manager, in which case, the Company may cover said expenses). Any Holder who
is permitted to own a Unit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but has not
been admitted as a Member shall have the right to distributions and
allocations with respect to such Unit owned by such Holder but shall not have
any further rights as a Member under this Agreement or the Act.

 



 

(f) _Conditions_. The admission of any Person as a Member shall be conditioned
upon such Persons written acceptance and adoption of all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, either by (i) execution and delivery of a
joinder agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
" _Joinder Agreement_ "), and shall take such other actions as the Manager
shall consider appropriate for such additional Member to become bound by the
terms of this Agreement to the Company or (ii), if requested by the Manager, a
writing evidencing the intent of such Person to become a Member (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Manager).

 



 

(g) This _Section 6.1_ shall apply with respect to all Holders of Units, and
the legend on the cover page of this Agreement with respect to the membership
interests shall apply with respect to all of the Units.

 



 

SECTION 6.2. _Securities Law Compliance_. Each Holder further agrees that it
will not make or attempt any Transfer of Units unless such Transfer is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and, in either case, in
compliance with all applicable state securities laws. The Company agrees, and
each Holder understands and consents, that the Company will not cause or
permit the Transfer of any Units to be made on its books (or on any register
of securities maintained on its behalf) unless the Transfer is permitted by,
and has been made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all
applicable federal and state securities laws. Each Holder agrees that in
connection with any Transfer of Units that is not made pursuant to a
registered public offering (other than to an Affiliate pursuant to _Section
6.1(a) _above), the Company may, in its sole discretion, request an opinion in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Company stating that such transaction is exempt
from registration under the Securities Act and in compliance with any
registration or similar requirements under applicable state securities laws.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.** ** 
RESERVED**

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII.** ** 
RESERVED**

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX.** ** 
CONFIDENTIALITY; COVENANTS**

 



 

SECTION 9.1. **_Use of Confidential Information_**. Each Holder agrees that it
will not use at any time any Confidential Information of which any such Holder
is or becomes aware except in connection with its investment in the Company
(except that Holders who are managers, directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries shall also be permitted to use such Confidential
Information in connection with the performance of their duties as managers,
directors, officer or employees).

 



 

SECTION 9.2. **_Related Confidentiality Covenants_**.

 



 

(a) Each Holder further agrees that the Confidential Information will be kept
strictly confidential and will not be disclosed by it or its Agents, except
(i) as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process or in response
to any inquiry from a regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
Holder, and only after compliance with _Section 9.2(b)_, and (ii) that it may
disclose the Confidential Information or portions thereof to those of its and
its Affiliates respective Agents who need to know such information in
connection with the investment by the Holder in the Company or any potential
transferees of any Holder so long as such transferee is bound by a
confidentiality agreement comparable to the provisions contained herein. Each
Holder agrees to be responsible for any breach of this _Article IX _by its
Agents or potential transferees (it being understood that such responsibility
shall be in addition to and not by way of limitation of any right or remedy
the Company may have against such Agents or potential transferees with respect
to any such breach).

 



 

(b) If any Holder or Agent thereof becomes legally compelled (including by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential
Information, such Holder or Agent shall provide the Company with prompt and,
if possible, prior written notice of such requirement to disclose such
Confidential Information. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, such Holder and its Agents shall disclose only
that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be
disclosed and shall, at the request and expense of the Company, take all
reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information. In addition, neither such Holder nor its Agent will oppose any
action (and such Holder and its Agents will, if and to the extent requested by
the Company and legally permissible to do so, cooperate with and assist the
Company, at the Companys expense and on a reasonable basis, in any reasonable
action) by the Company to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Confidential Information.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other
agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound,
the obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein, as they
relate to an investment in the Company (the " _Transaction_ "), shall not
apply to the tax structure or tax treatment of, or tax strategies relating to,
the Transaction, and each party hereto (and any employee, representative, or
agent of any party hereto) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax structure and tax treatment of, and tax
strategies relating to, the Transaction and all materials of any kind

 



     

 

 



 

(including opinions or other tax analysis) that are provided to such party
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided however, that such
disclosure shall not include Confidential Information not relevant to the tax
structure or tax treatment of the Transaction and shall not include
information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply
with applicable securities laws.

 



 

SECTION 9.3. **_Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_**.

 



 

(a) Each Holder hired in an executive capacity by the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries, which individuals shall sign this Agreement either currently or
at the time any of the foregoing executives are hired, hereby covenants and
agrees that such Holder shall not, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) during the Restricted Period, engage, whether as principal, agent,
investor, distributor, representative, stockholder, equity holder, consultant,
volunteer or otherwise, with or without pay, in any activity or business
venture, anywhere within a fifty (50) mile radius of each location at which
the Company, Braden Partners, L.P. (d/b/a Pacific Pulmonary Services), Sound
Oxygen Service LLC, Bennett Medical Services, MedBridge Home Medical, Roberts
Home Medical, TriCounty Medical Equipment and Supply, LLC, Royal Medical
Supply, Inc., First Choice Home Medical Equipment, LLC, Ocean LLC, Ocean of
PA, Verus Healthcare, Inc., or any other Affiliate of the Company does
business, which is competitive with the business of owning and/or operating a
durable medical equipment business;

 



 

(ii) during the Restricted Period, (A) solicit or endeavor to solicit any
client, customer, director, officer, employee, agent or consultant of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, either on such Holders own account or for
any other Person, or (B) employ any person who was a manager, director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any person who
is or is likely to be in possession of confidential information or trade
secrets of the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (C) induce or attempt to
influence any Person that has a referring relationship with the Company or any
of its Affiliates, or any health care payor or insurer that has a contractual
arrangement with the Company or any of its Affiliates, to terminate or not
renew such relationship; or

 



 

(iii) take any action or make any statement the effect of which would be,
directly or indirectly, to disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or
the business reputation or good name of the Company or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Each Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that the provisions set forth
in this _Section 9.3 _are fair, reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Company and its Holders, and that this _Section
9.3 _was negotiated and bargained for by the parties hereto.

 



 

(c) Each such Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i) a breach of the
provisions of this _Section 9.3 _would result in immediate, substantial and
irreparable damage to the

 



     

 

 



 

Company and its Holders and (ii) such damage would be extremely difficult to
measure in terms of monetary damages and no other remedy for such breach would
be adequate. Therefore, upon such a breach, the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance of these provisions and injunctive or other appropriate
equitable relief and the breaching Person shall be responsible for the payment
of court costs and other fees and expenses incurred by the Company (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with the enforcement of this
_Section 9.3_.

 



 

(d) Each such Holder hereby agrees that if the scope of any restriction or
covenant contained in this _Section 9.3 _should be or become too broad or
extensive to permit enforcement thereof to its fullest extent, then such
restriction or covenant shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by
law, and each Holder hereby consents and agrees that (i) it is the parties
intention that the covenants and restrictions contained herein be enforced as
written and (ii) in the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that any restriction or covenant contained herein is too broad or extensive to
permit enforcement thereof to its fullest extent, the scope of any such
restriction or covenant may be modified accordingly in any judicial proceeding
brought to enforce such restriction or covenant, but should be modified to
permit enforcement of the restrictions and covenants contained herein to the
maximum extent the court, in its judgment, will permit.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations and restrictions set forth
in this _Section 9.3_ shall not apply to McLarty or any of its transferees.

 



 

(f) For the purposes of clarity, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations and restrictions set forth in this _Section 9.3_ shall not apply
to BlueMountain or any of its transferees.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the obligations and
restrictions of the Rollover Member and Mr. Roberts set forth in this _Section
9.3_, (i) SnapWorx, LLC and its business shall not be subject to this _Section
9.3_, provided that the business of SnapWorx, LLC shall comply with the
restrictions outlined in that certain Subscription Agreement, dated May 17,
2018, between SnapWorx LLC and the Company and there shall be no breach of the
restrictions outlined in the Subscription Agreement, and (ii) the business of
providing an ozone cleaning product shall not be subject to this _Section
9.3_.

all federal, state and local tax returns of the Company for each year for
which such returns are required to be filed. The Manager shall determine the
appropriate treatment of each item of Company income, gain, loss, deduction

modification of this Agreement or the Certificate (whether by merger,

 **ARTICLE IV**

 

 **CAPITALIZATION**

 



 

Section 4.1 _Authorized Capital Stock_. The total number of shares of all
classes of capital stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue is
250,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 245,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (the " ** _Common Stock_** "), which shall include (i)
[ ] shares of Class A Common Stock (the " ** _Class A Common Stock_**")
and (ii) [ ] shares of Class B Common Stock (the " ** _Class B Common
Stock_**") and (b) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (the " ** _Preferred Stock_** "). Subject to the rights of the holders
of any one or more series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the number of
authorized shares of any of the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or
Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased, in each case by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section
242(b)(2) of the DGCL, and no vote of the holders of any of the Class A Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class
will be required therefor.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Existing Common Stock_. Upon this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate becoming effective pursuant to the DGCL, each share of the
Corporations common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and
outstanding or held in treasury, shall automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof be renamed as and become one share of Class A
Common Stock.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
" ** _Board_** ") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the
unissued shares of the Preferred Stock for one or more series of Preferred
Stock and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included
in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other
rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included in
a certificate of designation (a " ** _Preferred Stock Designation_** ") filed
pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the
authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any
such resolution or resolutions.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Common Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Voting_.

 



 

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the
shares of Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect
to the Corporation.

 



 

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares
of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each
matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation on which the
holders of the shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote. The holders of
Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which the
holders of the shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote.

 



 

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the
shares of Common Stock shall have the exclusive

 



     

 

 



 

right to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders
of the shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment
to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to
any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or
more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected
series of Preferred Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation) or the DGCL.

 



 

(b) _Dividends_. Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of the
shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and
other distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the
Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and
shall share equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.
Dividends shall not be declared or paid on the Class B Common Stock, except
with respect to stock dividends as set forth in _Section 4.4(d)_.

 



 

(c) _Liquidation Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_. Subject to
applicable law, to the rights of the holders of Class B Common Stock to
exchange their shares of Class B Common Stock and Common Units for shares of
Class A Common Stock in accordance with the Exchange Agreement (or for the
consideration payable in respect of shares of Class A Common Stock in such
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up), and the
rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred
Stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of
the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of the shares
of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in
proportion to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held by them.
Except as otherwise provided above with respect to the exchange rights of
holders of the Class B Common Stock under the terms of the Exchange Agreement,
the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled
to receive any assets of the Corporation in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Reclassification_. In no event will any stock dividends, stock splits,
reverse stock splits, combinations of stock, reclassifications or
recapitalizations be declared or made on any Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock, as the case may be, unless contemporaneously therewith (i) all
shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock at the time
outstanding are treated in the same proportion and the same manner and (ii)
the stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination of stock,
reclassification or recapitalization has been reflected in the same
economically equivalent manner with respect to all Common Units. Stock
dividends with respect to Class A Common Stock may be paid only with Class A
Common Stock. Stock dividends with respect to Class B Common Stock may be paid
only with Class B Common Stock; provided, that the deemed transfer and
retirement of shares of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation in accordance
with terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement shall not be a transaction
subject to this _Section 4.4(d)_.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Restrictions on Transfer and Issuances_.

 



 

(a) No shares of Class B Common Stock may be issued except to a holder of
Common Units (other than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation
that is a holder of

 



     

 

 



 

Common Units), such that after such issuance of Class B Common Stock such
holder holds an identical number of Common Units and shares of Class B Common
Stock. The Corporation shall take all actions necessary so that, for so long
as the Class B Common Stock is outstanding, the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock outstanding shall equal the number of Common Units outstanding.

 



 

(b) No shares of Class B Common Stock may be transferred by the holder thereof
except (i) for no consideration to the Corporation, upon which transfer of
such shares shall, to the full extent permitted by law, automatically be
retired or (ii) the holder thereof also transfers a corresponding number of
Common Units (as such numbers may be adjusted to reflect equitably any stock
split, subdivision, combination or similar change with respect to Class B
Common Stock of Common Units) in accordance with the terms of the Exchange
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between the Corporation, AdaptHealth
Holdings LLC (" ** _AdaptHealth_** ") and the other persons from time to time
party thereto (as may be amended, the " ** _Exchange Agreement_** "), copies
of which will be provided to any stockholder of the Corporation upon written
request therefor. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issuable pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement to satisfy its obligations under the Exchange
Agreement; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed to
preclude the Corporation from satisfying its obligations in respect of any
such exchange by delivery of (x) shares of Class A Common Stock which are held
in the treasury of the Corporation or (y) cash in lieu of shares of Class A
Common Stock in the amount permitted by the Exchange Agreement. All shares of
Class A Common Stock issued upon any such exchange will, upon issuance, be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Any stock certificates
representing shares of Class B Common Stock shall include a legend referencing
the transfer restrictions set forth herein. As used in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, " ** _Common Units_** " has the meaning
assigned to such term in the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Agreement of AdaptHealth, as may be amended.

 



 

(c) Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, each holder of Class B Common Stock
has the right to surrender a Common Unit together with a share of Class B
Common Stock to AdaptHealth in exchange for one fully paid and non-assessable
share of Class A Common Stock (or the cash equivalent). Any shares of Class B
Common Stock surrendered in such an exchange shall automatically be deemed
canceled without any action on the part of any person, including the
Corporation. Any such canceled shares of Class B Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding, and all rights with respect to such shares shall automatically
cease and terminate.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon the
exchange of Class B Common Stock and Common Units under the terms of the
Exchange Agreement will be made without charge to the holders of the shares of
Class B Common Stock and of the Common Units for any stamp or other similar
tax in respect of the issuance, unless any such shares of Class A Common Stock
are to be issued in a name other than that of the then record holder of the
shares of Class B Common Stock and Common Units being exchanged, in which case
the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof will pay to the
Corporation the amount of any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issuance or will establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Corporation that the tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to create
and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof to
acquire from the Corporation any shares of its capital stock of any class or
classes, with such rights, warrants and options to be evidenced by or in
instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is empowered to set the
exercise price, duration, times

 



     

 

 



 

for exercise and other terms and conditions of such rights, warrants or
options; provided, however, that the consideration to be received for any
shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise thereof may not be less than
the par value thereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 

 **BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the powers
and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (" **
_Bylaws_** "), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and
do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation,
subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation; provided, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders of the Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board
that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

 



 

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial
Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire
at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following
the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the term
of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the successors elected to replace
the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be
elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their
respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, if
the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed, any increase or
decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain
the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no
case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board
shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the
holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class
or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of
Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality
of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby
expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members
of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such classification)
becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

 



 

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _Section
5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be
filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director
(and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for
the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which the new
directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such directors
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote

shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended unless a
director violated his or her duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law,
authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from his or her
actions as a director. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing
sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " ** _proceeding_** ") by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " **
_indemnitee_** "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without
limitation,

 



     

 

 



 

attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section
8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_, except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses,
the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

 



 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any
indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights
that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to
the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when
such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of,
or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment
or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

 



 

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

transaction or interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or
developed by, or which otherwise comes into the possession of (i) any director
of the Corporation who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its

partner, member, director, stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder,
other than someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, " ** _Covered Persons_** "), unless such matter,
transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by,
or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and
solely in such Covered Persons capacity as a director of the

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation, such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and
contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the
Corporation to pursue, and to the extent the director is permitted to refer
that opportunity to the Corporation without violating any legal or contractual
obligation. Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions
of this _Article IX_ shall not adversely affect any right or protection of
any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time
of such amendment, repeal or modification.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 

 **AMENDMENT OF AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and

force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed

fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, (iv) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the
internal affairs doctrine or (v) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, except
for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction
of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court
of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of _Section 11.1_ immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " ** _Foreign
Action_** ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed
to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action
brought in any such court to enforce _Section 11.1_ immediately above (an "
** _FSC Enforcement Action_** ") and (ii) having service of process made upon
such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

(including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other
persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby, and (ii) the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to
permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and
agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for
the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 ** _DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN REALIZED TAX BENEFITS_**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Exchange Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the
filing of the U.S. federal Corporate Taxpayer Return for each Taxable Year in
which any Exchange has been effected by a TRA Holder, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall deliver to the Agent a schedule (the " _Exchange Schedule_ ") that
shows, in reasonable detail necessary to perform the calculations required by
this Agreement, including with respect to each TRA Holder participating in any
Exchange during such Taxable Year, (i) the Basis Adjustments with respect to
the Reference Assets as a result of the Exchanges effected by such TRA Holder
in such Taxable Year and (ii) the period (or periods) over which such Basis
Adjustments are amortizable and/or depreciable.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Attribute Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the
filing of the U.S. federal Corporate Taxpayer Return for the Taxable Year
including the Effective Date, the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to the
Agent a schedule (the " _Attribute Schedule_ ") that shows, in reasonable
detail necessary to perform the calculations required by this Agreement,
including with respect to each TRA Holder to which such items are applicable
(i) the Blocker NOLs attributable to Blocker as of the Effective Date and (ii)
any applicable limitations on the use of Blocker NOLs for Tax purposes
(including under Section 382 of the Code).

 



 

Section 2.3. _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing
of the U.S. federal Corporate Taxpayer Return for any Taxable Year in which
there is a Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall provide to the Agent: (i) a schedule showing, in reasonable
detail, (A) the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax
Detriment for such Taxable Year, (B) the portion of the Net Tax Benefit, if
any, that is Attributable to each TRA Holder, (C) the Accrued Amount with
respect to any such Net Tax Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Holder,
(D) the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ of this
Agreement due to each such TRA Holder, and (E) the portion of such Tax Benefit
Payment that the Corporate Taxpayer intends to treat as Imputed Interest (a "
_Tax Benefit Schedule_ "), (ii) a reasonably detailed calculation by the
Corporate Taxpayer of the Hypothetical Tax Liability, (iii) a reasonably
detailed calculation by the Corporate Taxpayer of the Actual Tax Liability,
(iv) a copy of the Corporate Taxpayer Return for such Taxable Year, and (v)
any other work papers reasonably requested by the Agent. In addition, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall allow the Agent reasonable access at no cost to the
appropriate representatives of the Corporate Taxpayer in connection with a
review of such Tax Benefit Schedule. The Tax Benefit Schedule will become
final as provided in _Section 2.4(a)_ and may be amended as provided in
_Section 2.4(b)_ (subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_).

 



 

(b) _Applicable Principles_. The Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax
Detriment for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the decrease or
increase in the Corporate Taxpayers actual liability for Taxes for such
Taxable Year that is attributable to the Basis Adjustments, Blocker NOLs and
Imputed Interest, determined using a "with and without" methodology. For the
avoidance of doubt, such actual liability for Taxes will take into account the
deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for
as interest under the Code based

 



     

 

 



 

upon the characterization of Tax Benefit Payments as additional consideration
payable by the Corporate Taxpayer. For purposes of calculating the Realized
Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for any Taxable Year, carryforwards or
carrybacks of any Tax item (such as a net operating loss) attributable to the
Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest shall be considered to be subject to
the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and the corresponding
provisions of state and local Tax laws, as applicable, governing the use,
limitation and expiration of carryforwards or carrybacks of the relevant type.
If a carryforward or carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is
attributable to the Basis Adjustment, Blocker NOLs or Imputed Interest (a "
_TRA Portion_ ") and another portion that is not so attributable (a " _Non-TRA
Portion_ "), such respective portions shall be considered to be used in
accordance with the "with and without" methodology so that: (i) the amount of
any Non-TRA Portion is deemed utilized first, followed by the amount of any
TRA Portion; and (ii) in the case of a carryback of a Non-TRA Portion, such
carryback shall not affect the original "with and without" calculation made in
the applicable prior Taxable Year. For the avoidance of doubt, the TRA Portion
of any Tax item when such item is incurred shall be determined using a
marginal "with and without" methodology by calculating (i) the amount of such
Tax item for all Tax purposes taking into account the Basis Adjustments,
Blocker NOLs or Imputed Interest and (ii) the amount of such Tax item for all
Tax purposes without taking into account the Basis Adjustments, Blocker NOLs
or Imputed Interest, with the TRA Portion equal to the excess of the amount
specified in clause (i) over the amount specified in clause (ii) (but only if
such excess is greater than zero). The parties agree that (i) any payment
under this Agreement, including the Accrued Amount (other than amounts (i)
arising from Blocker NOLs or (ii) accounted for as Imputed Interest) will be
treated as a subsequent upward adjustment to the purchase price of the
relevant Exchangeable Units and will have the effect of creating additional
Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the Corporate Taxpayer in the year
of payment, and (ii) as a result, such additional Basis Adjustments will be
incorporated into the current year calculation and into future year
calculations, as appropriate.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Procedure; Amendments_.

 



 

(a) An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding
on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which the
Agent has received the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto unless (i) the
Agent, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving an applicable Schedule
or amendment thereto, provides the Corporate Taxpayer with notice of a
material objection to such Schedule (" _Objection Notice_ ") made in good
faith or (ii) the Agent provides a written waiver of such right of any
Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which
case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date a waiver
from the Agent has been received by the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate
Taxpayer and Agent, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the
issues raised in an Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of such Objection Notice, the Corporate
Taxpayer and Agent shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures under _Section
7.9_.

 



 

(b) The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be amended from time to
time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i) in connection with a Determination
affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the Schedule
identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information
relating to a Taxable Year after the date the Schedule was provided to the
Agent, (iii) to comply with the Experts determination under the
Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect

 



     

 

 



 

a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such
Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other
Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax
Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an
amended Corporate Taxpayer Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to
adjust an Exchange Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to
this Agreement (any such Schedule, an " _Amended Schedule_ "). The Corporate
Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule to the Agent within sixty (60)
calendar days of the occurrence of an event referenced in clauses (i) through
(vi) of the preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event a
Schedule is amended after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)_, the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into account in calculating
any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which the amendment relates but
instead shall be taken into account in calculating the Cumulative Net Realized
Tax Benefit for the Taxable Year in which the amendment actually occurs.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III.**

 



 

 ** _TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS_**

 



 

Section 3.1. _Payments_.

 



 

(a) Within five (5) calendar days after a Tax Benefit Schedule delivered to
the Agent becomes final in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Holder the Tax Benefit Payment in respect of
such TRA Holder determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ for such Taxable
Year. Each such payment shall be made by check, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account previously designated by the
TRA Holder to the Corporate Taxpayer, or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Holder. For the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit
Payment shall be made in respect of estimated Tax payments, including, without
limitation, U.S. federal or state estimated income Tax payments.

 



 

(b) A " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Holder for a Taxable Year
means an amount, not less than zero, equal to the sum of the portion of the
Net Tax Benefit Attributable to such TRA Holder and the Accrued Amount with
respect thereto. A Net Tax Benefit is " _Attributable_ " to a TRA Holder to
the extent that it is derived from any (i) Basis Adjustment or Imputed
Interest that is attributable to the Exchangeable Units acquired or deemed
acquired by the Corporate Taxpayer in an Exchange undertaken by or with
respect to such TRA Holder or (ii) Blocker NOLs or Imputed Interest that is
attributable to the Blocker. Subject to _Section 3.3_, the " _Net Tax
Benefit_ " for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such
Taxable Year over (ii) the total amount of payments previously made under this
_Section 3.1_ (excluding payments attributable to Accrued Amounts);
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no TRA Holder shall be required
to return any portion of any previously made Tax Benefit Payment. The "
_Accrued Amount_ " with respect to any portion of a Net Tax Benefit shall
equal an amount determined in the same manner as interest on such portion of
the Net Tax Benefit for a Taxable Year calculated at the Agreed Rate from the
due date (without extensions) for filing the Corporate Taxpayer Return for
such Taxable Year until the Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax
purposes, the Accrued Amount shall not be treated as interest but shall
instead be treated as additional consideration for the acquisition of
Exchangeable Units in an Exchange or the stock of Blocker in the
Reorganization Transactions (as applicable) unless otherwise required by law.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 3.2. _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the provisions of
this Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of any amount (including
interest) required under this Agreement. It is also intended that the
provisions of this Agreement will result in 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized
Tax Benefit, and the Accrued Amount thereon, being paid to the TRA Holders.
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in the appropriate manner
to achieve these fundamental results.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.3_ Pro Rata Payments; Coordination of Benefits.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.1_ to the contrary, to the extent
that the aggregate amount of the Corporate Taxpayers Tax benefit subject to
this Agreement is limited in a particular Taxable Year because the Corporate
Taxpayer does not have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize available
deductions and other attributes, the limitation on the Tax benefit for the
Corporate Taxpayer shall be allocated among the TRA Holders in proportion to
the respective amounts of Net Tax Benefit that would have been determined
under this Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient taxable income
so that there were no such limitation.

 



 

(c) After taking into account _Section 3.3(a)_, if for any reason the
Corporate Taxpayer does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all
Tax Benefit Payments due under this Agreement in respect of a particular
Taxable Year, then (i) the Corporate Taxpayer will pay the same proportion of
each Tax Benefit Payment due to each TRA Holder in respect of such Taxable
Year, without favoring one obligation over the other, and (ii) no Tax Benefit
Payment shall be made in respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit
Payments in respect of prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

 



 

(d) To the extent the Corporate Taxpayer makes a payment to a TRA Holder in
respect of a particular Taxable Year under _Section 3.1(a)_ of this Agreement
(taking into account _Section 3.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , but excluding payments
attributable to Accrued Amounts) in an amount in excess of the amount of such
payment that should have been made to such TRA Holder in respect of such
Taxable Year, then (i) such TRA Holder shall not receive further payments
under _Section 3.1(a) _until such TRA Holder has foregone an amount of
payments equal to such excess and (ii) the Corporate Taxpayer will pay the
amount of such TRA Holders foregone payments to the other Persons to whom a
payment is due under this Agreement in a manner such that each such Person to
whom a payment is due under this Agreement, to the maximum extent possible,
receives aggregate payments under _Section 3.1(a)_ (taking into account
_Section 3.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , but excluding payments attributable to Accrued
Amounts) in the amount it would have received if there had been no excess
payment to such TRA Holder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV.**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 4.1. _Early Termination by the Corporate Taxpayer_. With the written
approval of a majority of its independent directors, the Corporate Taxpayer
may terminate this Agreement at any time by paying to each TRA Holder the
Early Termination Payment due to such TRA Holder pursuant to _Section
4.5(b)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement shall only terminate
upon the receipt of the Early Termination Payment by the TRA Holders (such
termination, an " _Early_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Termination_ "). Upon payment of the Early Termination Payment by the
Corporate Taxpayer, the Corporate Taxpayer shall not have any further payment
obligations under this Agreement, other than for any (i) Tax Benefit Payment
previously due and payable but unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and
(ii) any Tax Benefit Payment due for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or
including the Early Termination Date (except to the extent that the amount
described in clause (ii) is included in the Early Termination Payment).

 



 

Section 4.2. _Early Termination upon Change of Control_. In the event of a
Change of Control, all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and such
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the Change of Control Date and shall include, but not be limited
to the following: (a) payment of the Early Termination Payment calculated as
if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on such Change of Control
Date, (b) payment of any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of a TRA Holder agreed
to by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Holder as due and payable but unpaid
as of the Early Termination Notice, and (c) payment of any Tax Benefit Payment
due for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including such Change of
Control Date (except to the extent that the amount described in clause (c) is
included in the Early Termination Payment). In the event of a Change of
Control, the Early Termination Payment shall be calculated utilizing the
Valuation Assumptions and by substituting in each case the term "Change of
Control Date" for the term "Early Termination Date."

 



 

Section 4.3. _Breach of Agreement_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer breaches any of its material
obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure to make any
payment when due, as a result of failure to honor any other material
obligation required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the
rejection of this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise, then, unless otherwise waived in writing by a majority of the TRA
Holders, such breach shall be treated as an Early Termination and all
obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and such obligations shall be
calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of
such breach and shall include, but shall not be limited to, (i) the Early
Termination Payment calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of a breach, (ii) any Tax Benefit Payment previously due
and payable but unpaid as of the date of the breach, and (iii) any Tax Benefit
Payment due for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including the date
of the breach (except to the extent that the amount described in clause (iii)
is included in the Early Termination Payment). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that the Corporate Taxpayer breaches any of its material
obligations under this Agreement, a majority of the TRA Holders shall be
entitled to elect to receive the amounts set forth in clauses (i), (ii), and
(iii) above or to seek specific performance of the terms hereof.

 



 

(b) The parties agree that the failure to make any payment due pursuant to
this Agreement within three (3) months of the date such payment is due shall
be deemed to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement for all
purposes of this Agreement, and that it shall not be considered to be a breach
of a material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant
to this Agreement within three (3) months of the date such payment is due. The
Corporate Taxpayer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
sufficient available funds for the purpose of making required payments under
this Agreement and shall use its

 



     

 

 



 

commercially reasonable efforts to avoid entering into credit agreements that
could be reasonably anticipated to materially delay the timing of any payments
under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.4. _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate Taxpayer chooses to
exercise its right of early termination under _Section 4.1_ above, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to the Agent notice of such intention to
exercise such right (the " _Early Termination Notice_ "). Upon delivery of the
Early Termination Notice or the occurrence of an event described in _Section
4.2_ or _Section 4.3(a)_, the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver (i) a schedule
showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Early Termination Payment
(the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") and (ii) any other work papers
reasonably requested by the Agent. In addition, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
allow the Agent reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate
representatives of the Corporate Taxpayer in connection with a review of such
Early Termination Schedule. The Early Termination Schedule shall become final
and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on
which the Agent has received such Schedule or amendment thereto unless (x) the
Agent, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the Early Termination
Schedule, provides the Corporate Taxpayer and each other Agent with notice of
a material objection to such Schedule made in good faith (" _Material
Objection Notice_ ") or (y) the Agent provides a written waiver of such right
of a Material Objection Notice within the period described in clause (x)
above, in which case such Schedule becomes binding on the date a waiver from
the Agent has been received by the Corporate Taxpayer (the " _Early
Termination Effective Date_ "). If the Corporate Taxpayer and Agent, for any
reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of
the Material Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and Agent shall employ
the Reconciliation Procedures under _Section 7.9_.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Payment upon Early Termination_.

 



 

(a) Within three (3) calendar days after the Early Termination Effective Date,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Holder its Early Termination
Payment. Each such payment shall be made by check, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by the
TRA Holder, or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA
Holder.

 



 

(b) The " _Early Termination Payment_ " shall equal, with respect to each TRA
Holder, the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of the
Early Termination Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be required to
be paid by the Corporate Taxpayer to such TRA Holder beginning from the Early
Termination Date and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions are applied.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V.**

 



 

 ** _SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS_**

 



 

Section 5.1. _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment, Early Termination Payment
or any other payment required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to any TRA
Holder under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of
payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable in respect
of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of the

 



     

 

 



 

Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (such obligations, " _Senior
Obligations_ ") and shall rank _pari passu_ with all current or future
unsecured obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior
Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the above, the
determination of whether it is a breach of this Agreement if the Corporate
Taxpayer fails to make any Tax Benefit Payment when due is governed by
_Section 4.3(a)_.

 



 

Section 5.2. _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. The amount of all or
any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment, Early Termination Payment or any other
payment under this Agreement not made to any TRA Holder when due under the
terms of this Agreement shall be payable together with any interest thereon,
computed at the Default Rate (or, if so provided in _Section 4.3(a)_, at the
Agreed Rate) and commencing from the date on which such Tax Benefit Payment,
Early Termination Payment or any other payment under this Agreement was due
and payable.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI.**

 



 

 ** _NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION_**

 



 

Section 6.1. _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer s and Tax Matters_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have full
responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters concerning the
Corporate Taxpayer, including without limitation preparing, filing or amending
any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any issue pertaining to
Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate
Taxpayer (i) shall notify the Agent of, and keep the Agent reasonably informed
with respect to, the portion of any audit, examination, or any other
administrative or judicial proceeding (a "Tax Proceeding") of the Corporate
Taxpayer by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which is reasonably expected to
affect the rights and obligations of the TRA Holders under this Agreement,
(ii) shall provide the Agent with reasonable opportunity to provide
information and other input to the Corporate Taxpayer and its advisors
concerning the conduct of any such portion of a Tax Proceeding, and (iii)
shall not enter into any settlement with respect to any such portion of a Tax
Proceeding that could have a material effect on the TRA Holders rights
(including the right to receive payments) under this Agreement without the
written consent of the Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporate Taxpayer
shall not be required to take any action, or refrain from taking any action,
that is inconsistent with any provision of the LLC Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall prepare, file, and/or amend all Tax Returns in
accordance with applicable law (including with respect to the calculation of
taxable income and any calculations required to be made under this Agreement)
and nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Agent or any TRA Holder from
disputing such Tax matters in accordance with _Section 7.9_.

 



 

Section 6.2. _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Holders agree
to report and cause to be reported for all purposes, including U.S. federal,
state and local Tax purposes and financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related
items (including, without limitation, the Basis Adjustments, Imputed Interest,
and each Tax Benefit Payment), but, for financial reporting purposes, only in
respect of items that are not explicitly characterized as "deemed" or in a
similar manner by the terms of this Agreement, in a manner consistent with
that set forth in any Schedule

 



     

 

 



 

required to be provided by or on behalf of the Corporate Taxpayer under this
Agreement, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, unless otherwise
required by applicable law. If the Corporate Taxpayer and any TRA Holder, for
any reason, are unable to successfully resolve any disagreement concerning
such treatment within thirty (30) calendar days, the Corporate Taxpayer and
such TRA Holder shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures under _Section
7.9_.

 



 

Section 6.3. _Cooperation_. Each TRA Holder shall (i) furnish to the Corporate
Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and other materials as
the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes of making any
determination or computation necessary or appropriate under this Agreement,
preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any Tax Proceeding, (ii)
make itself available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to
provide explanations of documents and materials and such other information as
the Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request in
connection with any of the matters described in clause (i) above, and (iii)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter. The Corporate
Taxpayer shall reimburse the TRA Holder for any reasonable third-party costs
and expenses incurred pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

Section 7.2. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
expressly provided in _Section 3.3_.

 



 

Section 7.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of laws principles thereof that would mandate the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable

 



      

 

 



 

manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Successors; Assignment_.

 



 

(a) No TRA Holder may assign this Agreement to any person without the prior
written consent of the Corporate Taxpayer; _provided_ , however, that

 



 

(i) to the extent Common Units are transferred in accordance with the terms of
the LLC Agreement, the transferring TRA Holder shall have the option to assign
to the transferee of such Common Units the transferring TRA Holders rights
under this Agreement with respect to such transferred Common Units as long as
such transferee has executed and delivered, or, in connection with such
transfer, executes and delivers, a joinder to this Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporate Taxpayer, agreeing to
become a "TRA Holder" for all purposes of this Agreement, and

 



 

(ii) any and all payments payable or that may become payable to a TRA Holder
pursuant to this Agreement that, once an Exchange has occurred, arise with
respect to the Exchangeable Units transferred in such Exchange, may be
assigned to any Person or Persons as long as any such Person has executed and
delivered, or, in connection with such assignment, executes and delivers, a
joinder to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporate Taxpayer, agreeing to be bound by _Section 7.14_ and
acknowledging specifically the terms of _Section 7.6(b)_.

 



 

For these purposes, a pledge by a TRA Holder of some or all of its rights,
interests or entitlements under this Agreement to any U.S. bank in connection
with a bona fide loan or other indebtedness shall not constitute an assignment
of this agreement; provided that (y) if Common Units are transferred to such
U.S. bank as a result of a foreclosure or other action relating to such
pledge, such transfer shall be a transfer within the meaning of _Section
7.6(a)(i)_ or (z) if such U.S. bank becomes entitled to payments payable or
that may become payable to a TRA Holder as a result of such pledge, such U.S.
bank will be treated as a Person to whom such payments were assigned within
the meaning of _Section 7.6(a)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, if a TRA
Holder transfers Common Units but does not assign to the transferee of such
Common Units the rights of such TRA Holder under this Agreement with respect
to such transferred Common Units, such TRA Holder shall continue to be
entitled to receive the Tax Benefit Payments, if any, due hereunder with
respect to, including any Tax Benefit Payments arising in respect of a
subsequent Exchange of, such Common Units.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.6_, no
assignee described in _Section 7.6(a)(ii)_ shall have any rights under this
Agreement except for the right to enforce its right to receive payments under
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Person designated as the Agent may not be changed without the prior
written consent of the Corporate Taxpayer and TRA Holders who would be
entitled to receive more than

 



     

 

 



 

fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments
payable to all TRA Holders hereunder if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised
its right of Early Termination on the date of the most recent Exchange prior
to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made
to any TRA Holder pursuant to this Agreement since the date of such most
recent Exchange).

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit
of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer shall cause any direct or indirect
successor (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by
written agreement, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be
required to perform if no such succession had taken place.

 



 

Section 7.7. _Amendments; Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be
amended unless such amendment is approved in writing by each of the Corporate
Taxpayer and by TRA Holders who would be entitled to receive more than fifty
percent (50%) of the aggregate amount of the Early Termination Payments
payable to all TRA Holders hereunder if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised
its right of Early Termination on the date of the most recent Exchange prior
to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made
to any TRA Holder pursuant to this Agreement since the date of such most
recent Exchange); _provided_ , however, that no such amendment shall be
effective if such amendment would have a disproportionate effect on the
payments certain TRA Holders will or may receive under this Agreement unless
all such disproportionately affected TRA Holders consent in writing to such
amendment.

 



 

Section 7.8. _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are
not to be considered in construing this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.9. _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer and
the Agent or any TRA Holder (as applicable, the " _Disputing Party_ ") are
unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to the calculations required to
produce the schedules described in _Section 2.4_, _Section 4.4 _and _Section
6.2_ within the relevant period designated in this Agreement ("
_Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for
determination to the Expert. The Expert shall be a partner or principal in a
nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and unless the Corporate
Taxpayer and the Disputing Party agree otherwise, the Expert shall not, and
the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship
with the Corporate Taxpayer or the Disputing Party or other actual or
potential conflict of interest. If the parties are unable to agree on an
Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of
written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the Expert shall be appointed by
the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert shall
resolve (a) any matter relating to the Exchange Schedule or an amendment
thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within
thirty (30) calendar days, (b) any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule
or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days , and (c) any matter
related to treatment of any tax-related item as contemplated in _Section 6.2_
within fifteen (15) calendar days, or, in each case, as soon

 



     

 

 



 

thereafter as is reasonably practicable after such matter has been submitted
to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a
disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax
Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, any portion of such
payment that is not under dispute shall be paid on the date prescribed by this
Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate
Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and
expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax Return
shall be borne by the Corporate Taxpayer except as provided in the next
sentence. The Corporate Taxpayer and the Disputing Party shall each bear its
own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert adopts such
Disputing Partys position, in which case the Corporate Taxpayer shall
reimburse such Disputing Party for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts the Corporate
Taxpayers position, in which case such Disputing Party shall reimburse the
Corporate Taxpayer for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such
proceeding. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute
within the meaning of this _Section 7.9_ shall be decided by the Expert. The
Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the
determinations of the Expert pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall be binding
on the Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries and the Disputing Party and may
be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each party hereto irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
State of Delaware and the state courts of the State of Delaware for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party hereto further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by United States certified
or registered mail (in each such case, prepaid return receipt requested) to
such partys respective address set forth in the Companys books and records
or such other address or to the attention of such other person as the
recipient party has specified by prior written notice to the sending party
shall be effective service of process in any action, suit or proceeding in
Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction
as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each party hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the United States District Court for the
State of Delaware or the state courts of the State of Delaware and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

Section 7.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION
WITH COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN
EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND
FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT
THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS.
THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE
COMPANY) HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
HERETO, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,

 



     

 

 



 

ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER.

 



 

Section 7.12. _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporate
Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the relevant TRA Holder.

 



 

Section 7.13. _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated Group;
Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

 



 

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer becomes a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, or unitary group of corporations that files a consolidated,
combined, or unitary income Tax Return pursuant to Sections 1501 _et seq._ of
the Code or any corresponding provisions of U.S. state or local Tax law, or
would be eligible to become a member of such a group at the election of one or
members of that group, then, subject to the application of the Valuation
Assumptions upon a Change of Control: (i) the provisions of this Agreement
shall be applied with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit
Payments, Early Termination Payments and other applicable items hereunder
shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the
group as a whole.

 



 

(b) If any entity that is obligated to make a Tax Benefit Payment or Early
Termination Payment hereunder transfers one or more assets to a corporation
(or a Person classified as a corporation for Tax purposes) with which such
entity does not file a consolidated Tax Return pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Code or any provisions of state or local Tax law, such entity, for purposes of
calculating the amount of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment
(e.g., calculating the gross income of the entity and determining the Realized
Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment of such entity) due hereunder, shall be
treated as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the
date of such contribution. The consideration deemed to be received by such
entity shall be equal to the fair market value of the contributed asset. Thus,
for example, in determining the Hypothetical Tax Liability of the entity, the
taxable income of the entity shall be determined by treating the entity as
having sold the asset for its fair market value, recovering any basis
applicable to such asset (using the Tax basis that such asset would have had
at such time if no Basis Adjustments had been made), while the Actual Tax
Liability of the entity would be determined by recovering the actual Tax basis
of the asset that reflects any Basis Adjustments. For purposes of this
_Section 7.13_, a transfer of a partnership interest shall be treated as a
transfer of the transferring partners share of each of the assets and
liabilities of that partnership. If any entity that is obligated to make a Tax
Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment hereunder transfers one or more
assets to a partnership (or a Person classified as a partnership for Tax
purposes), the principles of this _Section 7.13(b)_ and this Agreement shall
govern the treatment of such transfer and any subsequent allocations of
income, gain, loss or deductions from such partnership to such entity.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 7.14. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) The Agent, each TRA Holder and each of the TRA Holders assignees
acknowledges and agrees that the information of the Corporate Taxpayer is
confidential and, except in the course of performing any duties as necessary
for the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates, as required by law or legal
process or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, such person shall keep and
retain in the strictest confidence and not disclose to any Person any
confidential matters, acquired pursuant to this Agreement, of the Corporate
Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors, concerning the Company and its
Affiliates and successors or the TRA Holders, learned by the Agent or any TRA
Holder heretofore or hereafter. This _Section 7.14_ shall not apply to (i)
any information that has been made publicly available by the Corporate
Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a
result of an act of the Agent or a TRA Holder in violation of this Agreement)
or is generally known to the business community and (ii) the disclosure of
information (A) as may be proper in the course of performing such TRA Holders
obligations, or monitoring or enforcing such TRA Holders rights, under this
Agreement, (B) as part of such TRA Holders normal reporting, rating or review
procedure (including normal credit rating and pricing process), or in
connection with such TRA Holders or such TRA Holders Affiliates normal fund
raising, marketing, informational or reporting activities, or to such TRA
Holders (or any of its Affiliates) Affiliates, auditors, accountants,
attorneys or other agents, (C) to any bona fide prospective assignee of such
TRA Holders rights under this Agreement, or prospective merger or other
business combination partner of such TRA Holder, _provided_ that such assignee
or merger partner agrees to be bound by the provisions of this _Section
7.14_, (D) as is required to be disclosed by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, administrative body or governmental body, or by subpoena,
summons or legal process, or by law, rule or regulation; _provided_ that any
TRA Holder required to make any such disclosure to the extent legally
permissible shall provide the Corporate Taxpayer prompt notice of such
disclosure, or to regulatory authorities or similar examiners conducting
regulatory reviews or examinations (without any such notice to the Corporate
Taxpayer), or (E) to the extent necessary for a TRA Holder to prepare and file
its Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding such Tax Returns from
any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any Tax Proceeding with respect
to such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Agent (and each employee, representative or other agent of Agent or its
assignees, as applicable) and each TRA Holder and each of its assignees (and
each employee, representative or other agent of such TRA Holder or its
assignees, as applicable) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Corporate
Taxpayer, the Company, the Agent, the TRA Holders and their Affiliates, and
any of their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or the TRA Holder
relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure.

 



 

(b) If the Agent or an assignee or a TRA Holder or an assignee commits a
breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this
_Section 7.14_, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right and remedy to
have the provisions of this _Section 7.14_ specifically enforced by
injunctive relief or otherwise by any court of competent jurisdiction without
the need to post any bond or other security, it being acknowledged and agreed
that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to
the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Subsidiaries or the TRA Holders and the
accounts and funds managed by the Corporate Taxpayer and that money

 



     

 

 



 

damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such Persons. Such
rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 7.15. _No Similar Agreements_. Neither the Corporate Taxpayer nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any additional agreement providing rights
similar to this Agreement to any Person (including any agreement pursuant to
which the Corporate Taxpayer is obligated to pay amounts with respect to tax
benefits resulting from any net operating losses or other tax attributes to
which the Corporate Taxpayer becomes entitled as a result of a transaction)
without the prior written consent of the TRA Holders who would be entitled to
receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate amount of the Early
Termination Payments payable to all TRA Holders hereunder if the Corporate
Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the date of the most
recent Exchange (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made
to any TRA Holder pursuant to this Agreement since the date of such most
recent Exchange).

 



 

Section 7.16. _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if, in connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a TRA
Holder reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause
income (other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this
Agreement) recognized by such TRA Holder upon any Exchange to be treated as
ordinary income rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at ordinary
income rates) for U.S. federal income and all applicable state and local Tax
purposes or would have other material adverse Tax consequences to the TRA
Holder and/or its direct or indirect owners, then at the election of the TRA
Holder and to the extent specified by the TRA Holder, this Agreement (i) shall
cease to have further effect with respect to such TRA Holder, (ii) shall not
apply to an Exchange by the TRA Holder occurring after a date specified by it,
or (iii) shall otherwise be amended in a manner determined by the TRA Holder
to waive any benefits to which such TRA Holder would otherwise be entitled
under this Agreement, provided that such amendment shall not result in an
increase in or acceleration of payments under this Agreement at any time as
compared to the amounts and times of payments that would have been due in the
absence of such amendment.

ARTICLE XII

 



 

SECTION 12.01 _Exchange of Common Units_.

 



 

(a) _Elective Exchanges_.

 



 

(i) Each Member shall be entitled, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof and the LLC Agreement, to surrender Exchangeable Units and a
corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock after taking into
account the Exchange Rate (in each case, free and clear of all Liens) to Pubco
in exchange for the delivery to such Member (or its designee) of either, at
the option of Pubco, (x) a number of shares of Class A Common Stock that is
equal to the product of the applicable Net Exchanged Unit Amount multiplied by
the Exchange Rate or (y) the applicable Cash Payment. Any exchange of
Exchangeable Units and Class B Common Stock for Class A Common Stock or the
Cash Payment, as applicable, is defined herein as an " _Exchange_." Subject to
_Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, a Member may Exchange Common Units at any time and from
time to time, but a Member may not Exchange Common Units more than once per
fiscal quarter without the prior consent of Pubco or the Manager. The minimum
number of Exchangeable Units (and corresponding number of shares of Class B
Common Stock after taking into account the Exchange Rate, if any) that may be
exchanged by any Member shall be the lesser of (A) 10,000 and (B) all of the
Exchangeable Units (and corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock
after taking into account the Exchange Rate, if any) then held by such Member
and its Affiliates, except that such minimum shall not apply if such Exchange
is in connection with the exercise of any incidental registration rights
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Member
shall be entitled to effectuate an Exchange of Exchangeable Units (and a
corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock after taking into
account the Exchange Rate,

 



     

 

 



 

if any) as set forth in this _Section 2.1(a)_, and Pubco shall have the right
to refuse to honor any request for such an Exchange, if at any time Pubco
determines based on the advice of counsel that such Exchange (1) would be
prohibited by law or regulation (including, without limitation, the
unavailability of a registration of such Exchange under the Securities Act, or
an exemption from the registration requirements thereof), (2) would not be
permitted under any agreement with Pubco or any of its Subsidiaries to which
the applicable Member is party (including, without limitation, the LLC
Agreement), (3) would result in a negative adjustment from the Exchange under
Section 743(b) of the Code with respect to the Company, or (4) solely in the
case of an Exchange requested by an officer, director or other personnel of
Pubco, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, would not be permitted under
any written policy of Pubco, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries related
to restrictions on trading by such officers, directors or other personnel.
Upon such determination, Pubco shall notify the Member requesting the Exchange
of such determination, which such notice shall include an explanation in
reasonable detail as to the reason that the Exchange has not been honored.

 



 

(iii) A Member shall exercise its right to effectuate an Exchange of
Exchangeable Units and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common
Stock after taking into account the Exchange Rate (if any), as set forth in
this _Section 2.1(a)_ by delivering to Pubco and the Company during normal
business hours, (A) a written election of exchange in respect of the
Exchangeable Units to be exchanged substantially in the form of Exhibit B
hereto (an " _Exchange Notice_ "), duly executed by such Member, (B) any
certificates in such Members possession representing such Exchangeable Units,
(C) any stock certificates in such Members possession representing such
shares of Class B Common Stock and (D) if Pubco or any exchanging Subsidiary
requires the delivery of the certification contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)_,
such certification or written notice from such Member that it is unable to
provide such certification. An Exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_
shall be effected on the second Business Day following the Business Day on
which Pubco shall have received the items specified in clauses (A)-(D) of the
first sentence of this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ or such later date that is a
Business Day specified in the Exchange Notice (such Business Day, the "
_Exchange Date_ "); _provided_ , that Pubco may establish alternate exchange
procedures as necessary in order to facilitate the establishment by a Member
of a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange
Act. On the Exchange Date, all rights of the exchanging Member as a holder of
the Exchangeable Units and shares of Class B Common Stock that are subject to
the Exchange shall cease, and unless Pubco has elected Cash Payment, such
Member (or its designee) shall be treated for all purposes as having become
the record holder of the shares of Class A Common Stock to be received by the
exchanging Member in respect of such Exchange.

 



 

(iv) Within two (2) Business Days following the Business Day on which Pubco
has received the Exchange Notice, Pubco shall give written notice (the "
_Contribution Notice_ ") to the exchanging Member of its intended settlement
method; _provided_ that if Pubco does not timely deliver a Contribution
Notice, Pubco shall be deemed to have not elected the Cash Payment method.

 



 

(v) A Member may specify, in an applicable Exchange Notice, that the Exchange
is to be contingent (including as to timing) upon the occurrence of any

 



     

 

 



 

transaction or event, including the consummation of a purchase by another
Person (whether in a tender or exchange offer, an underwritten offering,
Change of Control transaction or otherwise) of shares of Class A Common Stock
or any merger, consolidation or other business combination.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the settlement method
with respect to an Exchange by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1 of the LLC
Agreement shall be the applicable Cash Payment.

 



 

(b) _Change of Control_. Pubco shall provide written notice of an expected
Change of Control to all Members within the earlier of (x) five (5) Business
Days following the execution of the agreement with respect to such Change of
Control and (y) ten (10) Business Days before the proposed date upon which the
contemplated Change of Control is to be effected, indicating in such notice
such information as may reasonably describe the Change of Control transaction,
subject to applicable law, including the date of execution of such agreement
or such proposed effective date, as applicable, the amount and types of
consideration to be paid for Exchangeable Units and shares of Class B Common
Stock or shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in the Change of
Control (which consideration shall be equivalent whether paid for Exchangeable
Units and shares of Class B Common Stock or shares of Class A Common Stock),
any election with respect to types of consideration that a holder of
Exchangeable Units and shares of Class B Common Stock or shares of Class A
Common Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to make in connection with the
Change of Control, the percentage of total Exchangeable Units and shares of
Class B Common Stock or shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, to be
transferred to the acquirer by all shareholders in the Change of Control, and
the number of Exchangeable Units and shares of Class B Common Stock held by
each Member that Pubco intends to require to be Exchanged for shares of Class
A Common Stock in connection with the Change of Control. Pubco shall update
such notice from time to time to reflect any material changes to such notice.
Pubco may satisfy any such notice and update requirements described in the
preceding two sentences by providing such information on a Form 8-K, Schedule
TO, Schedule 14D-9, Preliminary Merger Proxy on Schedule 14A, Definitive
Merger Proxy on Schedule 14A or similar form filed with the SEC.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Consideration_. As promptly as practicable on or after the
Exchange Date, provided the Member has satisfied its obligations under
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, Pubco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such
Member (or its designee), either certificates or evidence of book-entry shares
representing the number of shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable upon the
applicable Exchange, registered in the name of the relevant exchanging Member
(or its designee) or, if Pubco has so elected, the Cash Payment.
Notwithstanding anything set forth in this _Section 2.1(c)_ to the contrary,
to the extent the Class A Common Stock issued in the exchange will be settled
through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, Pubco will, upon the
written instruction of an exchanging Member, deliver the shares of Class A
Common Stock deliverable to such Member through the facilities of The
Depository Trust Company to the account of the participant of The Depository
Trust Company designated by such Member in the Exchange Notice. Upon a Member
exercising its right to Exchange in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)(i)_,
Pubco shall take such actions as may be required to ensure that such Member
receives the shares of Class A Common Stock or the Cash Payment that such
exchanging Member is entitled to receive in connection with such Exchange
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Legends_.

 



 

(i) The shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon an Exchange, other than any
such shares issued in an Exchange subject to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, shall bear a legend in substantially the
following form:

 



 

THE TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW), OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM.

 



 

(ii) Pubco covenants and agrees that, if a registration statement under the
Securities Act is effective and available for Class A Common Stock to be
delivered with respect to any Exchange, Class A Common Stock that have been
registered under the Securities Act shall be delivered in respect of such
Exchange. If any Exchange in accordance with this Agreement is to be effected
at a time when any required registration has not become effective or otherwise
is unavailable, upon the request and with the reasonable cooperation of the
exchanging Member requesting such Exchange, Pubco shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly facilitate such Exchange pursuant to any
reasonably available exemption from such registration requirements. Pubco
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to list the Class A Common Stock
required to be delivered upon Exchange prior to such delivery upon each
national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system upon which the
outstanding Class A Common Stock may be listed or traded at the time of such
delivery.

 



 

(iii) If (A) any shares of Class A Common Stock have been sold pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective by the SEC, (B) all of
the applicable conditions of Rule 144 are met, or (C) the legend (or a portion
thereof) otherwise ceases to be applicable, Pubco, upon the written request of
the holder thereof, shall promptly provide such holder or its respective
transferees with new certificates (or evidence of book-entry share) for
securities of like tenor not bearing the provisions of the legend with respect
to which the restriction has terminated. In connection therewith, such holder
shall provide Pubco with such information in its possession as Pubco may
reasonably request (which may include an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Pubco) in connection with the removal of any such legend.

 



 

(e) _Cancellation of Class B Common Stock_. Any shares of Class B Common
Stock surrendered in an Exchange shall automatically be deemed cancelled
without any action on the part of any Person, including Pubco. Any such
cancelled shares of Class B Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding, and
all rights with respect to such shares shall automatically cease and
terminate.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) _Expenses_. Subject to any other arrangement or agreement among Pubco and
an applicable Member, Pubco, any exchanging Subsidiary and each exchanging
Member shall bear their own expenses in connection with the consummation of
any Exchange, whether or not any such Exchange is ultimately consummated,
except that Pubco shall bear any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or
other similar taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of, any Exchange;
provided, however, that if any shares of Class A Common Stock are to be
delivered in a name other than that of the Member that requested the Exchange
(or The Depository Trust Company or its nominee for the account of a
participant of The Depository Test Company that will hold the shares for the
account of such Member) or the Cash Payment is to be paid to a Person other
than the Member that requested the Exchange, then such Member or the Person in
whose name such shares are to be delivered or to whom the Cash Payment is to
be paid shall pay to Pubco the amount of any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or
duties, or other similar taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of,
such Exchange or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Pubco that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(g) _Publicly Traded Partnership_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if the Manager of the Company, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and tax advisor, shall determine in good faith that interests in
the Company do not meet the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.7704-1(h) (or other provisions of those Regulations as determined by the
Manager in its sole discretion), the Company may impose such restrictions on
Exchanges as the Company may reasonably determine to be necessary or advisable
so that the Company is not treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under
Section 7704 of the Code.

 



 

SECTION 12.02 _Adjustment_.

 



 

The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted accordingly if there is: (a) any
subdivision (by any stock or unit split, stock or unit dividend or
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse stock or unit split, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the shares of Class B Common
Stock or Common Units that is not accompanied by a substantively identical
subdivision or combination of the Class A Common Stock; or (b) any subdivision
(by any stock or unit split, stock or unit dividend or distribution,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse stock or unit split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the shares of Class A Common Stock that is
not accompanied by a substantively identical subdivision or combination of the
shares of Class B Common Stock or Common Units. To the extent not reflected in
an adjustment to the Exchange Rate, if there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction (including any
Change of Control) in which the Class A Common Stock is converted or changed
or exchanged into or for another security, securities or other property, then
upon any subsequent Exchange, an exchanging Member shall be entitled to
receive the amount of such security, securities or other property that such
exchanging Member would have received if such Exchange had occurred
immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, taking into
account any adjustment as a result of any subdivision (by any split,
distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or other property
that occurs after the effective time of such reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or other similar transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if
there is any reclassification, reorganization,

 



     

 

 



 

recapitalization or other similar transaction (including any Change of
Control) in which the Class A Common Stock is converted or changed or
exchanged into or for another security, securities or other property, this
_Section 2.2_ shall continue to be applicable, _mutatis mutandis_ , with
respect to such security or other property.

 



 

SECTION 12.03 _Class A Common Stock to be Issued_.

 



 

(a) Pubco shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized
but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon an
Exchange, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all outstanding Common Units; _provided_ ,
however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude Pubco
from satisfying its obligations in respect of any such Exchange by delivery of
unencumbered purchased shares of Class A Common Stock (which may or may not be
held in the treasury of Pubco or any subsidiary thereof) or cash in lieu of
shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Pubco has taken and will take all such steps as may be required to cause
to qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the
Exchange Act, and be exempt for purposes of Section 16(b) under the Exchange
Act, any acquisitions or dispositions of equity securities of Pubco (including
derivative securities with respect thereto) and any securities that may be
deemed to be equity securities or derivative securities of Pubco for such
purposes that result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by
each director or officer of Pubco (including directors-by-deputization) who
may reasonably be expected to be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Pubco upon the registration
of any class of equity security of Pubco pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (with the authorizing resolutions specifying the name of each
such officer or director whose acquisition or disposition of securities is to
be exempted and the number of securities that may be acquired and disposed of
by each such Person pursuant to this Agreement).

 



 

(c) If any Takeover Law or other similar law or regulation becomes or is
deemed to become applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Pubco shall use its reasonable best efforts to render
such law or regulation inapplicable to all of the foregoing.

 



 

(d) Pubco covenants that all shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon an
Exchange will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and not subject to any preemptive right of stockholders of Pubco or to any
right of first refusal or other right in favor of any Person.

 



 

SECTION 12.04 _Withholding; Certification of Non-Foreign Status_.

 



 

(a) If Pubco shall be required to withhold any amounts by reason of any
federal, state, local or foreign tax rules or regulations in respect of any
Exchange, Pubco shall be entitled to take such action as it deems appropriate
in order to ensure compliance with such withholding requirements, including,
at its option, withholding shares of Class A Common Stock with a fair market
value equal to the minimum amount of any taxes that Pubco may be required to
withhold with respect to such Exchange. To the extent that amounts are (or
property is) so withheld and paid

 



     

 

 



 

over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts (or property)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid (or
delivered) to the applicable Member.

 



 

(b) An exchanging Member shall deliver to Pubco a certification of non-foreign
status that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)
and Section 1446(f) of the Code prior to an Exchange. In the event the Member
does not provide such certification, Pubco shall nevertheless deliver or cause
to be delivered to the exchanging Member the Class A Common Stock or the Cash
Payment in accordance with _Section 2.1_, but subject to withholding as
provided in _Section 2.4(a)_.

 



 

SECTION 12.05 _Tax Treatment_.

 



 

Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that any Exchange with Pubco or the Company shall be treated as a
direct exchange between Pubco and the Member for U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income tax purposes. The parties hereto intend to treat any
Exchange consummated hereunder as a taxable sale of the Exchangeable Units in
a transaction governed by Section 1001 of the Code by the exchanging Member to
Pubco for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes and
no party hereto shall take an position inconsistent with such intended tax
treatment on any tax return, amendment thereof or any other communication with
a taxing authority, in each case unless otherwise required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

 



 

SECTION 12.06 _Distributions_.

 



 

No Exchange will impair the right of an exchanging Member to receive any
distribution for periods ending on or prior to the Exchange Date for such
Exchange (but for which payment had not yet been made with respect to the
Exchangeable Units in question at the time the Exchange is consummated).

SECTION 14.02 _Permitted Transferees_.

 



 

To the extent that a Member (or an applicable Permitted Transferee of such
Member) validly transfers after the date hereof any or all of its Common Units
and corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock after taking into account the
Exchange Rate (to the extent that such Member holds such shares), to a
Permitted Transferee of such Person or to any other Person in a transaction
not in contravention of, and in accordance with, the LLC Agreement, then the
transferee thereof shall have the right to execute and deliver a joinder to
this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. Upon execution of
any such joinder, such transferee shall, with respect to such transferred
Common Units and shares of Class B Common Stock (to the extent that such
Member holds such shares), be entitled to all of the rights and bound by each
of the obligations applicable to the relevant transferor hereunder; _provided_
that the transferor shall remain entitled to all of the rights and bound by
each of the obligations with respect to Common Units and shares of Class B
Common Stock (to the extent that such Member holds such shares) that were not
so transferred.

 



 

SECTION 14.03 _Severability_.

 



 

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 14.04 _Counterparts_.

 



 

This Agreement and any amendments may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts and delivered via facsimile or .pdf, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one
and the same document. The signature of any party to any counterpart shall be
deemed a signature to, and may be appended to, any other counterpart.

 



 

SECTION 14.05 _Entire Agreement_.

 



 

This Agreement together with the LLC Agreement and the Tax Receivables
Agreement (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior
agreements, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and (b) is not intended to confer upon any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their Permitted Transferees, any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 14.06 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

Each party hereto shall execute, deliver, acknowledge and file such other
documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested from
time to time by any other party hereto to give effect to and carry out the
transactions contemplated herein.

 



 

SECTION 14.07 _Governing Law_.

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

SECTION 14.08 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the State of Delaware and the state courts of
the State of Delaware for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each
party hereto further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by United States certified or registered mail (in each such case,
prepaid return receipt requested) to such partys respective address set forth
in the Companys books and records or such other address or to the attention
of such other person as the recipient party has specified by prior written
notice to the sending party shall be effective service of process in any
action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the United States
District Court for the State of Delaware or the state courts of the State of
Delaware and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

SECTION 14.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST
QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE
PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN
ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A
JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST
COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE COMPANY) HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY
DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER ARISING IN
CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 14.10 _Amendments_.

 



 

The provisions of this Agreement may be amended only by the affirmative vote
or written consent of each of (i) the Company and (ii) Members holding a
majority of the then outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by
Pubco); _provided_ that no amendment may disproportionately affect the rights
of a Member compared to other Members without the consent of such Member. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

 



 

SECTION 14.11 _Assignment_.

 



 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors, assigns and Permitted Transferees.

 



 

SECTION 14.12 _Independent Obligations_.

 



 

The obligations of each Member hereunder are several and not joint with the
obligations of any other Member, and no Member shall be responsible in any way
for the performance of the obligations of any other Member under hereunder.
The decision of each Member to enter into to this Agreement has been made by
such Member independently of any other Member. Nothing contained herein, and
no action taken by any Member pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute
the Members as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other
kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Members are in any way acting
in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

SECTION 14.13 _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

The parties hereto acknowledge that the remedies at law of the other parties
for a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and,
in recognition of this fact, any party to this Agreement, without posting any
bond, and in addition to all other remedies that may be available, shall be
entitled to equitable relief in the form of specific performance, a temporary
restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable
remedy that may then be available.

executed by their respective authorized representatives as of the day and year
first above written.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

Reference is hereby made to (i) that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of July 8, 2019 (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), by and among
AdaptHealth Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " **
_Company_** "), DFB Healthcare Acquisitions Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
** _Pubco_** "), Access Point Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **
_A Blocker_** "), Clifton Bay Offshore Investments L.P., a British Virgin

Islands exempted limited partnership (collectively, the " ** _BM Blocker
Sellers_** " and, together with the A Blocker Seller, the " ** _Blocker
Sellers_** "), BM AH Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
" ** _BM Blocker_** " and together with the A Blocker, the " ** _Blockers_**
"), DFB Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Merger
Sub_** "), and AH Representative LLC, as the Company Unitholders
Representative (the " ** _Company Unitholders  Representative_**") and (ii)
the BM Redemption Notes (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and
the BM Replacement Notes (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement),
collectively, the " ** _BM Notes_** "). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the BM Notes.

 



 

1. **_Pubco Board Seat_**

 



 

i. During the period commencing upon the date hereof and ending on the Board
Right Termination Date, the Purchasers (or their permitted transferees)
holding a majority of the outstanding principal amount under the BM Notes (the
" ** _Noteholder Majority_** ") shall have the option and right, exercisable
by delivering a written notice of such designation to the Company, to
designate and nominate for election one (1) person (the " ** _Board
Designee_** ") to serve on the board of directors of Pubco (the " ** _Board_**
"), and the Company and Pubco, whether acting through the Board, any
applicable committee of the Board or otherwise, shall take all actions within
its control that are necessary or advisable to effect the foregoing,
including, without limitation, by taking any or all of the following actions
as necessary: (i) causing one or more incumbent directors serving on the Board
to resign;

     

 

 



 

(ii) expanding the size of the Board; (iii) appointing such Board Designee to
any vacant or newly-created director position; (iv) including the Board
Designee in the slate of director nominees recommended to Pubcos stockholders
for election to the Board or (v) including the Board Designee in the proxy
statement prepared by Pubco in connection with the solicitation of proxies for
any meeting of Pubco stockholders called with respect to the election of
members of the Board at which the election of the Board Designee is to be
considered, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every
action or approval by written consent of the Board with respect to the
election of members of the Board; _provided_ , _however_ ; that such Board
Designee shall (x) not be prohibited from serving as a director pursuant to
any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
national securities exchange on which Pubcos equity interests are listed or
admitted to trading, and (y) not be an employee or director of any competitor
to the Company or Pubco. The Purchasers agree upon the Companys or Pubcos
request, to timely provide Pubco with accurate and complete information
relating to the Board Designee as may be required to be disclosed by Pubco
under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The initial Board Designee is [*]. Prior to the Board Right Termination Date,
the Board Designee may be removed or replaced by the Noteholder Majority at
any time, and any vacancy occurring by reason the death, disability,
resignation, removal for cause or other cessation of a person serving as Board
Designee, shall be filled solely by the Noteholder Majority. Any action by the
Noteholder Majority to designate, remove or replace a Board Designee shall be
evidenced in writing furnished to the Board, shall include a statement that
the action has been approved by the Noteholder Majority and shall be executed
by or on behalf of the Noteholder Majority. While serving as a Board Designee,
a Board Designee shall be entitled to vote on any matter on which independent
members of the Board are entitled to vote on (unless prohibited by the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or applicable
national securities exchange). Notwithstanding any rights to be granted or
provided to the Board Designee hereunder, the Board may exclude the Board
Designee from access to any Board or committee materials or information or
meeting or portion thereof or written consent if the Board determines, in good
faith, including the Board Designee in discussions relating to such
determination (but not requiring the affirmative vote of such Board Designee),
that such access would reasonably be expected to result in a conflict of
interest with the Pubco or the Company (other than a conflict of interest with
respect to the Noteholders ownership interest in Pubco or the Company);
provided, that such exclusion shall be limited to the portion of the Board or
committee material or information and/or meeting or written consent that is
the basis for such exclusion and shall not extend to any portion of the Board
or committee material and/or meeting that does not involve or pertain to such
exclusion. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Board Designee
will receive the same information provided to other similarly situated (i.e.,
independent, non-affiliate) members of the Board, at the same time as such
information is provided to other similarly situated members of the Board,
including without limitation monthly information packages, and will receive
copies of all written materials and other information given to members of any
committee of the Board. The option and right to appoint a Board Designee
granted to the Purchasers hereunder may not be transferred or assigned
directly or indirectly whether by contract, merger, operation of law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



     

 

 



 

ii. [The Board Designee is not entitled to compensation from Pubco or the
Company].(5) Pubco will reimburse the Board Designee for all reasonable and
documented expenses incurred in connection with the Board Designees
participation in meetings of the Board or any committee of the Board,
including, without limitation, all reasonable and documented travel, lodging
and meal expenses, in each case to the same extent as Pubco reimburses any
other non-executive member of the Board for such expenses.

 



 

iii. Pubco shall maintain in effect at all times directors and officers
indemnity insurance covering the Board Designee to the same extent and on the
same terms as any directors and officers indemnity insurance maintained by
the Pubco with respect to the other non-executive members of the Board. Any
directors and officers indemnity insurance shall be primary to any insurance
coverage for the Board Designee maintained by any other person. Prior to the
Board Right Termination Date, Pubco shall not amend or alter any right to
indemnification, exculpation or the advancement of expenses covering or
benefiting any Board Designee contained in Pubcos Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws as in effect on
the date of the BM Notes without the prior written consent of the Noteholder
Majority, except if such amendment or alteration (A) provides a broader right
to indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses than those
previously contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or Amended and Restated Bylaws, as applicable, or (B) is required to comply
with applicable law.

 



 

iv. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by BlueMountain, subject to applicable
law and applicable stock exchange rules, Pubco shall take all necessary or
advisable action, whether acting through the Board, any applicable committee
of the Board or otherwise, to cause the Board Designee to be appointed to the
Compensation Committee of the Board; provided, that the Board Designee
satisfies all applicable independence requirements, as determined in good
faith by the Board.

 



 

v. For the purposes of the BM Notes, the " ** _Board Right Termination Date_**
" means the date upon which the BM Notes have been paid in full. For the
avoidance of doubt, upon the Board Right Termination Date (A) the Noteholder
Majoritys rights pursuant to this Section 1 shall expire and terminate
immediately and (B) the Noteholder Majority shall cause any Board Designees to
resign from the Board.

 



 

vi. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 1, if the BM Notes are not
paid in full on or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) days following the
Maturity Date, then, until the BM Notes have been paid in full, the number of
Board Designees that the Noteholder Majority shall have the right to designate
hereunder shall be increased to the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) twenty-five
percent (25%) of the number of seats on the Board, rounded down to the nearest
whole number, and the provisions of this Section 1 shall apply with respect to
any such additional Board Designee, _mutatis mutandis._

2. **_Activities of Pubco_**. Prior to the Board Right Termination Date, Pubco may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time hold or acquire assets in its own name or otherwise other than through the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, that in such event Pubco shall take commercially reasonable measures to ensure that the economic benefits and burdens of such assets are otherwise vested in the Company or its Subsidiaries, through assignment, mortgage, loan or otherwise or, if it is not commercially reasonable to vest such economic interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Pubco shall negotiate in good faith to amend the Surviving Company LLC Agreement (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) to reflect such activities and the direct ownership of assets by Pubco. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit Pubco from executing any guarantee of indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

3. **_Miscellaneous_** **.**

 



 

i. This agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed in that State. All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
Delaware Chancery Court, or if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware.
The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Chancery Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this agreement may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

 



 

ii. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this agreement. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications herein.

 



 

iii. This agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile or
portable document format (.pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.
