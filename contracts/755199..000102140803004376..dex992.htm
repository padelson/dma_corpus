Adverse Effect. To the Sellers Knowledge, each Permit is in full force and
effect, and each Acquired Company is in compliance with all of its
obligations with respect to each Permit, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect or to be in compliance would not be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, and to the Sellers Knowledge, no event has
occurred that permits, or upon the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
otherwise would permit, revocation or termination of any Permit except such as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Seller is not making any
representation or warranty that any Permits can or will be transferred as of
the Closing Date or can be maintained by the Buyer or the Acquired Companies
from and after the Closing.

(m) _Employee Matters_. There has not been, during the three (3) years
prior to the date of this Agreement, any strike, work stoppage or slow-
down with respect to the employees or contractors of the Acquired Companies
whose primary responsibilities are the providing of operational support for
the Acquired Companies. The Acquired Companies are not a party to any
collective bargaining or other agreement with any union or other association
of employees. Except as included in _Section 4.1(j)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, none of the current or past officers, directors or employees of the
Acquired Companies has a pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened
claim against the Acquired Companies. There are no contracts of employment or
change in control agreements with any of the employees of the Acquired
Companies.

(n) _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

(i) _Section 4.1(n)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as
of the date hereof, of each material plan, program, or arrangement relating
to compensation or employee benefits (i) maintained by the Acquired Companies,
(ii) to which the Acquired Companies are a party, (iii) under which the
Acquired Companies have any material obligation or liability or (iv) which
provides material compensation or employee benefits to the employees of the
Acquired Companies (each, a " _Company Plan_ "). The Seller has made
available to the Buyer true and complete copies of each Company Plan and such
other documents relating thereto as the Buyer has reasonably requested.

(ii) Neither the Acquired Companies nor any of its Affiliates has
incurred any liability under Title IV of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 13 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

(" _ERISA_ "), nor does the Seller reasonably expect that any such liability
will be so incurred. No Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Each of the Acquired Companies has
received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect
to each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of
Section 401 of the Code.

(iii) To the Knowledge of the Seller, the Acquired Companies have
complied with all applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA, the National Labor
Relations Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and all other
Laws pertaining to (i) the employment of all employees of the Acquired
Companies and (ii) the Company Plans, in the case of each of (i) and (ii)
except where the failure so to comply would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(iv) Except as may be provided otherwise under _Section 6.4_ hereof, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current
or former employee of the Acquired Companies to severance pay, termination
pay or other, similar payments, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due, with respect to any such
employee, in each case except as provided in this Agreement.

**4.2** _ ** Limitation of Representations and Warranties**_ **.** The
following limitations apply with regard to any representations and warranties
by the Seller:

(a) The Buyer acknowledges that (i) it has had and pursuant to this
Agreement will have before Closing access to the Seller and the Acquired
Companies, and the officers and employees of the Seller and (ii) in making the
decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, the Buyer has relied solely on the basis
of its own independent investigation and upon the express representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth in this Agreement. Without
limiting the above, the Buyer has, prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, (i) reviewed the environmental site assessments of the Sites
prepared for the Seller, (ii) had full opportunity to conduct to its
satisfaction inspections of the Sites, and (iii) fully completed and approved
the results of all inspections of the Sites. The Buyer acknowledges, after
such review and inspections, that no further investigation of the Sites is
necessary for purposes of acquiring the Shares for the Buyers intended use,
and Buyer hereby waives any and all objections to or claims with respect to
all physical characteristics and existing conditions at the Sites, including
existing Environmental Conditions and the presence of any Hazardous Substances
at the Sites. THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT.

(b) WITHOUT LIMITING THE ABOVE, THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND THE SELLER
MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AND WHETHER BY COMMON LAW, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING (I) THE
QUALITY, CONDITION, OR OPERABILITY OF ANY PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, OR
FIXTURES, (II) ITS MERCHANTABILITY, (III) ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR (IV) ITS CONFORMITY TO MODELS, SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OR
MANUFACTURER DESIGN, AND ALL PERSONAL PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS DELIVERED "AS
IS, WHERE IS" IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE SAME EXISTS.

the event all or any portion of such Superfund Sites and/or the liabilities
associated therewith cannot legally be transferred, or cannot be transferred

Closing to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules applicable to that
Party with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if
existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules. For the purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof have been
fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be
deemed to exclude all information contained in any supplement or amendment
thereto. However, if the Closing shall occur (without limiting  _Section
7.1(g)_ hereof), then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or
amendment at or prior to the Closing shall be deemed included in the
Disclosure Schedules and no Party shall be entitled to make a claim thereon
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

**5.9** _ ** Tank 401 Repairs**_ **.** The Parties acknowledge and
agree that Tank 401 is currently out of service and in need of certain
repairs, which cannot be completed prior to the Closing Date. The Parties
further acknowledge that the estimated costs to clean and repair Tank 401 in a
manner to make Tank 401 available for service consistent with Sellers past
practices is the sum of $832,000 (the "Estimated Repairs Costs"), as may be
adjusted for accuracy by mutual agreement of the Parties at Closing. In the
event the cleaning of Tank 401 has not been completed on or before the Closing
Date, the Seller shall assign to the Buyer and the Buyer shall receive and
assume the cleaning contract dated December 19, 2002 by and between the Seller
its affiliates and Cliff Berry, Inc. (the "Cleaning Contract") and shall cause
such cleaning activity to be completed as soon as practicable in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Cleaning Contract. Further,
Seller, or its designee, shall enter into a contract with a vendor and
containing terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Buyer for the
repair of Tank 401 (the "Repair Contract"). In the event the repairs to Tank
401 have not been completed prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall assign

shall provide the Buyer with copies of all invoices and related documentation
evidencing all costs billed to and paid by Seller or its designee with
respect to Tank 401 repairs pursuant to both the Cleaning Contract and the
Repair Contract (the "Paid Repair Costs"). The difference between the
Estimated Repair Costs and the Paid Repair Costs (including any costs paid on
or prior to Closing) shall be a credit to the Buyer and shall be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.7(d) above. The
Buyer shall thereafter assume all liability for and make payment of all
remaining sums due under both the Cleaning Contract and the Repair Contract.

**5.10** _ ** Pro-ration of Taxes**_ **.** Any property Taxes assessed
against or pertaining to the Subject Assets, including the Real Properties,
for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date shall be prorated
between the Buyer and Seller as of the Closing Date. In the event the amount
of any such property Tax cannot be ascertained as of the Closing Date, then
pro-rations shall be made on the basis of the preceding year and to the
extent any such pro-rations may be inaccurate, the Seller and the Buyer agree
to make such payment to the other promptly after the tax statements have been
received as is necessary to allocate such property Taxes properly between the
Parties as of the Closing Date. The Buyer shall receive a credit against the
Purchase Price on the Closing Date for the Sellers pro-rata portion of any
such property Taxes which are due and payable after the Closing Date.
Conversely, the Purchase Price shall be increased on the Closing Date for the
Buyers pro-rata portion of any such property Taxes which were due and payable
on or prior to the Closing Date for taxable periods that include the Closing
Date. The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer, no later than ten
(10) days prior to the Closing Date, a schedule identifying and pro-rating on
an estimated basis all such property Taxes.

**5.11** _ ** Audit Report Escrow**_ **.**

(a) The Seller shall within five (5) days after the execution of this

public accounting firm reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, to conduct an
audit and provide an audit opinion in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards in the United States of the historical financial statements
of the Acquired Companies that comply with Regulation SX of the SEC, which
shall include the activities of the Subject Assets and exclude the activities
of the Excluded Assets through and as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Audit Report_ "). The Buyer shall provide (and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to provide after the Closing) reasonable assistance to the Seller in
preparation of the Audit Report. The Seller shall provide the Buyer with the
Audit Report upon its completion and the Buyer, upon receipt of the Audit
Report, will promptly reimburse the Seller an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of all third party expenses incurred by the Seller for the Audit Report.

(b) Upon the Closing, the Buyer shall transfer and deposit the Escrow
Funds into escrow which shall be held by an escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ ") which shall be a national bank mutually agreeable to the Seller and
the Buyer located in Houston, Texas and shall be held pursuant to an agreement
to be executed by, between and among the Buyer, the Seller and the Escrow
Agent containing such terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the
Seller and the Buyer (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), but which shall include
the general terms set forth in _Exhibit 5.11(b)_ hereto.

(c) In the event the Audit Report is _not_ finalized and delivered to
the Buyer on or prior to sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
then $10,000,000 of the Escrow Funds, plus accrued interest therein, shall be
released by the Escrow Agent and delivered to the Buyer as a permanent
reduction of the Purchase Price.

(d) In the event the Audit Report is _not_ finalized and delivered to
the Buyer on or prior to one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date, then the balance of the Escrow Funds ($15,000,000) plus accrued interest

amount of the Escrow Funds ($25,000,000), plus accrued interest therein, shall
be released by the Escrow Agent and delivered to the Seller.

(f) In the event the Audit Report is finalized and delivered to the
Buyer subsequent to sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, but on or prior
to one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, then the balance of
the Escrow Funds ($15,000,000), plus accrued interest therein, shall be
released by the Escrow Agent and delivered to the Seller.

** ARTICLE VI** 
 **POST-CLOSING COVENANTS**

**6.1** _ ** General**_ **.** In case at any time after the Closing
any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
each of the Parties will take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under _Article VIII_ ).

**6.2** _ ** Delivery and Retention of Records**_ **.** On or before
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Seller will deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Buyer, all original material agreements, documents, books,
files, records, information and data (including all Tax returns, reports or
forms and related workpapers, electronic data to the extent transferable)
relating exclusively to the Acquired Companies that are in the possession or
control of the Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Records_ "). The Buyer agrees
to cause the Acquired Companies to hold the Records in accordance with the
Buyers records retention policies following the Closing Date and to afford
the Seller, its accountants, and counsel, during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice and request, during such period, full access to the
Records and to the Buyers employees at no cost to the Seller (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket copying and other expenses); provided that such
access will not be construed to require the disclosure of Records that would
cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or like privilege;
provided, further, that in the event of any litigation nothing herein shall
limit any Partys rights of discovery under applicable Law. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentences, the Buyer agrees to provide the
Seller and its Affiliates reasonable access to and the right to make copies of
the Records after the Closing Date for the purposes of assisting the Seller
and its Affiliates (i) in complying with the Sellers obligations under this
Agreement (including without limitation, the preparation of the Inventory
Statement and to comply with any indemnity obligations), (ii) in preparing and
delivering any accounting provided for under this Agreement and adjusting,
prorating and settling the charges and credits provided for in this
Agreement, (iii) in preparing Tax returns, (iv) in responding to or disputing
any Tax audit, (v) in asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any claim
or dispute, known or unknown, (vi) in asserting, defending or otherwise
dealing with any Third Party Claim or dispute by or against the Seller or its
Affiliates(collectively, " _Access Events_ "). The access rights granted to
the Buyer, the Seller and their Affiliates herein and in _Sections 6.11 and
6.12_ hereof shall be construed so as to not unreasonably interfere with or
disrupt normal operations of the Party granting such access.

**6.3** _ ** Removal of Logos and Signs/Coastal License**_ **.**

(a) Promptly after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the names of the
Acquired Companies to be changed to delete any reference to "Coastal" or "El
Paso." Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, the Buyer shall remove from
any of the Subject Assets any logo or sign indicating that such assets were
owned or operated by the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including signs
displaying the Sellers or its Affiliates emergency contact telephone number
or otherwise using or displaying the phrases "El



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 19 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

Paso" or "Coastal", in whole or in part). As promptly as practical after the
Closing, the Buyer shall post the Buyers emergency contact telephone numbers
in place of any of the Sellers or its Affiliates emergency contact telephone
numbers.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.3(a)_ to the contrary,
the Seller shall grant to the Acquired Companies a non-royalty bearing
license pursuant to a license agreement (the "Coastal Trademark License
Agreement") to use the Trademarks referenced therein for the uses and in the
manner provided in the Coastal Trademark License Agreement. The Coastal
Trademark License Agreement shall be executed and delivered by the Parties at
the Closing in the form of _Exhibit 6.3(b)_ hereto.

**6.4** _ ** Employee Matters**_ **.**

(a) _Current Employees_. _Section 6.4(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a list of all employees of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the
" _Current Employees_ "), including employees who are receiving short-term
disability benefits or are on family and medical, administrative, or military
leave or any other type of leave (other than long-term disability) that
entitles the Current Employee to reinstatement upon completion of the leave
under the applicable leave policies of the Acquired Companies and including
dates of hire and annual compensation or hourly rates (including any
currently taxable profit-sharing, bonus or other form of compensation) of
such Current Employees as of January 13, 2003. The Seller shall be entitled to
update _Section 6.4(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule as necessary at any time
prior to Closing to reflect all employment changes.

(b) Buyer will evaluate and make hiring decisions with respect to the
Current Employees in a legal manner and will indemnify Seller with respect to
any claims or causes of action stemming from or related to such hiring
decisions. Notwithstanding the provisions contained herein to the contrary,
the Buyer shall not offer employment to, solicit or employ (or permit any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)) any of the employees listed
on _Section 6.4(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Prohibited Employees_
"). The Buyer will notify the Seller at least five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date as to which of the Current Employees the Buyer has extended or
intends to extend offers of employment, as well as those to whom Buyer has not
extended or will not extend an offer. The Buyer shall provide the Seller with
copies of all offers of employment made by the Buyer to Current Employees and
such offers shall include information concerning compensation, job title and
job location for each Current Employee to whom an employment offer is
extended.

(c) Buyer is not obligated to offer employment to or continue the
employment of any officer, employee, agent, or representative of the Seller,
including, without limitation, the Current Employees. Any successor clause or
agreement in any labor contracts or other labor arrangements, if any currently
in effect, would not be applicable to the sale and purchase of the Shares,
or otherwise affect or impose any conditions or obligations on the Buyer. All
Current Employees to whom Buyer offers employment and who accept such offer
shall cease active participation in all Company Plans. As of the first day
following the Closing Date, all Current Employees to whom Buyer offers
employment and who accept such offer shall be permitted to participate in the
plans, programs and arrangements of the Buyer and its Affiliates relating to
compensation and employee benefits (each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") on the same
terms as similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates.

(d) To the extent that Current Employees become eligible to participate
in any Buyer Plan, then for all purposes (including, without limitation,
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, early retirement and benefit
accrual), service with the Seller, the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates
and the predecessors of any of the foregoing shall be treated as service under
such Buyer Plan;  _provided, however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits. In addition, all Buyer Plans shall waive any pre-
existing conditions, actively-at-



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 20 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

work exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation by and
coverage of the Current Employees hired by the Buyer and their
eligible dependents.

(e) In the event that the employment of any Current Employee hired by
Buyer is terminated within one (1) year following the Closing (other than for
violation of generally applicable policies of the Buyer or its Affiliates or
other circumstances reasonably constituting cause), then the Buyer shall
provide such Current Employee with severance pay and benefits equal to the
severance pay and benefits available under the severance program of Buyer
available to similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates.

(f) The Seller will fully pay or otherwise satisfy any claims by any
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives of
the Seller relating to this Agreement, the performance or consummation of it,
and any claims by any of them relating to or arising out of (i) their
employment by Seller, (ii) any employment contract involving the Seller,
(iii) any pension or other benefit liabilities of Seller, (iv) any law
requiring notice of severance or severance benefit. With respect to any
Current Employees of the Seller who are terminated by the Seller, the Seller
will defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer) and indemnify the
Buyer from and against all claims, expenses, lawsuits and obligations with
respect to or arising from such termination, and the Seller will comply with
all applicable Laws in connection with the same, including, without
limitation, the WARN Act subject to the Buyers compliance with _Section 6.7_
hereof.

**6.5** _ ** Computer Matters**_ **.**

(a) In order to permit the Seller to pursue any amounts owed associated
with the Sellers EPHomeLink program by employees of the Acquired Companies
that are terminated after Closing, the Buyer agrees to provide written notice
of any employees of the Acquired Companies that (a) the Seller identifies in
writing that are participants in the EPHomeLink program and (b) are terminated
within two (2) years of the Closing Date. The Buyer shall provide such notice
to the Seller at the end of each calendar quarter during such two-year
period.

(b) For all periods on and after the Closing, the Buyer will secure
appropriate software and other licenses to utilize in conjunction with the
operation of the computer equipment that is part of the Subject Assets as set
forth in _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from any Adverse
Consequences that might arise from the Buyers failure to comply with
this subsection.

**6.6** _ ** Transition Services**_ **.** After the Closing Date, the
Seller will provide certain designated services to the Acquired Companies on
an interim basis to permit the Acquired Companies the opportunity to obtain
alternate sources of supply of such services within a reasonable time after
the Closing Date. Such services shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties
and shall be provided to the Buyer pursuant to a Transition Services
Agreement to be substantially in form of _Exhibit 6.6_ attached hereto (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ "), which shall be executed at the Closing.

**6.7** _ ** WARN Act**_ **.** The Buyer will not engage within sixty
(60) days of the Closing Date in a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" at any of
the Sites as such terms are defined in the WARN Act.

**6.8** _ ** Release and Replacement of Bonds, Guarantees, etc**_
**.** Promptly after the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the applicable
beneficiary new, replacement or substitute guaranties, letters of credit,
bonds, and other surety obligations for those set forth in _Section 6.8_ of
the Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Seller, shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the release effective as of the Closing Date of the Seller and its
Affiliates

Page 21 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

(excluding the Acquired Companies) from all obligations relating to any such
guaranties, letters of credit, bonds, or other surety obligations and
any liabilities related thereto.

**6.9** _ ** Divestiture**_ **.** Notwithstanding any other provision
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall assume the risk of loss and
the value of the Shares and the Subject Assets resulting from any DOJ or FTC
order issued subsequent to the Closing under the HSR Act that requires
divestiture by the Buyer of any Subject Assets or restricts the use thereof.
This _Section 6.9_  shall not be construed to modify _Section 5.2_ hereof.

**6.10** _ ** Restrictions**_ **.** If there are prohibitions against,
or conditions to, the transfer of any Permit or Assumed Contract, or if the
transfer, apportionment or division of any Permit or Assumed Contract,
contemplated to be transferred as of the Closing (or to be apportioned or
divided) pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent of third
parties, including Governmental Authorities whose consent is needed for
Permits to be issued to the Buyer or modified, which if not satisfied would
result in a breach of such prohibitions or conditions or would give an outside
party the right to terminate or limit any right of the Buyer or the Acquired
Companies with respect to any such Permit or Assumed Contract (herein called
a " _Restriction_ "), then, without delaying the Closing, any provision
contained in this Agreement shall not become effective with respect to such
Permit or Assumed Contract unless and until such Restriction is satisfied,
waived or no longer applies. Following the Closing, when and if such a
Restriction is so satisfied, waived or no longer applies, to the extent
permitted by Law and any applicable contractual provisions, the assignment of
the Permit or Assumed Contract shall become effective automatically as of the
Closing Date, without further action on the part of the Seller or the Buyer
and without payment of further consideration. Each of the Seller and the
Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain satisfaction
of any Restriction on a timely basis post-Closing. To the extent that any
Restriction continues to exist, the Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (without infringing upon the legal rights of such third
party or outside party or violating any Law) to provide the Buyer and the
Acquired Companies with the equivalent assets or benefits thereof
by subcontract or otherwise, at no additional cost to the Acquired Companies
(other than the assumption of any related liability and the performance and
compliance by the Acquired Companies with the terms of such Permit or Assumed
Contract) effective as of the applicable closing date. The Buyer agrees
(without infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or outside party
or violating any Law) to bear the economic burden of any related liability and
of the performance and compliance with the terms of the Permit or Assumed
Contract subject to the Restriction, at no additional cost to the Seller,
effective as of the Closing Date to the same extent as the Buyer would have
borne such liability and other obligations if this Agreement had been
effective as of the Closing Date with respect to such Permit or Assumed
Contract. In the case of an Assumed Contract, the Seller agrees (without
infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or outside party or
violating any Law) to exercise its rights under such contract at the
direction and/or for the benefit of the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall require or obligate the Buyer or
the Seller to purchase or pay consideration to acquire any new (other than
replacement) or additional Permit or other property right or interest.

**6.11** _ ** Access to Personnel**_ **.**

(a) The Buyer shall permit the Seller and its representatives, at the
Sellers expense, to have reasonable access to all former employees and other
personnel of the Seller and its Affiliates who are employed or retained by the
Buyer or the Acquired Companies who have relevant information regarding any
Access Events.

(b) The Seller shall permit the Buyer and its representatives, at the
Buyers expense, to have reasonable access to those employees and other

employed by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Subject
Assets and who have relevant information regarding any Access Events.

(c) The Buyer and the Seller agree, for purposes of this  _Section
6.11_ , that:

(i) the requesting party must provide advance notice to the providing
party of its request to obtain access to specified employees with sufficient
enough time to allow the providing party to rearrange work schedules to
accommodate the absence of the specified employee(s) from their work;

(ii) access to the specified employees must be during reasonable work
hours (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and the specified employees)
and be conducted in a manner so as not to interfere unduly with the business
operations of the providing party;

(iii) the requesting party will have access to the specified employees
only at the providing partys offices, unless otherwise agreed to by the
providing party (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld);

(iv) when a requesting party requires access to any employee in excess of
three (3) Business Days in any calendar year, the expenses to be borne by the
requesting party will include reimbursement for such employees wages upon
receipt of an invoice from the providing party;

(v) the providing party will not be held responsible for the specified
employees actions taken or testimony given on behalf of the requesting party;
and

access to any employees or other personnel pursuant to this _Section 6.11_
shall be limited to information which is relevant to the Access Events.

**6.12** _ ** Access to Sites**_ **.** From and after the Closing, the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall permit reasonable access to and entry upon the
Sites by the Seller and its Affiliates, without charge, as necessary (as
determined by the Seller in its sole but reasonable discretion) regarding
Access Events. In the event of and as a condition to a subsequent sale, lease
or other transfer of the Acquired Companies or the Subject Assets, the Buyer
shall require that Buyers transferee agree (in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Seller) to the access provisions of this _Section 6.12_.

**6.13** _ ** Accounts Receivable**_ **.** The Buyer and the Seller and
their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with and provide assistance to
each other to the extent reasonably requested by any Party to timely collect
the Accounts Receivable without offset or deduction. In the event the Buyer or
the Acquired Companies receive any funds or other property in payment of any
Accounts Receivable, then the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to
promptly forward such funds or property to the Seller. In the event the Seller
or any of its Affiliates receive any funds or other property in payment of any
Accounts Receivable of the Acquired Companies associated with periods on
or after the Closing Date, then the Seller shall promptly forward, or cause
its Affiliates to promptly forward, such funds or property to the Buyer.

**6.14** _ ** Tank 401**_ **.** Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the terms of the Terminal Capacity Lease Agreement
attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4(a)(v), from and after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall continue to make the applicable monthly tank rental payments to
the Buyer for the lease of Tank 401 while Tank 401 is being repaired as
referenced in Section 5.9 above; provided, however, that in the event such
repairs have not been completed by June 30, 2003, the Sellers obligation to
continue to make the monthly tank rental payments with respect to Tank 401
shall be suspended and



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 23 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

forgiven and the Seller shall have no further obligation to recommence payment
of monthly tank rentals until such repairs have been completed and Tank
401 placed back into service.

Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 25 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

(ii) all litigation set forth in _Schedule 4.1(j)_ of the Disclosure

(iii) (A) Taxes of the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
(excluding any Taxes included in the calculation of Inventory Value), any
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and one-half of the
Taxes described in _Section 9.7_ hereof, (B) all liability for Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the

including pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local or foreign law or regulation and all liability for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods as a transferee or successor and (C)

(i) The Sellers liability under this Agreement to indemnify pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%)
of the Purchase Price. The limitations on the Sellers indemnification
obligations set forth in the prior sentence shall not apply to losses
resulting from (i) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth

provided that in no event shall the Sellers liability under this Agreement
exceed, in aggregate, the Purchase Price.

(ii) Any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(ii) or
8.2(a)(vi)_ hereof must be made to the Seller on or before the eighth (8th)
annual anniversary of the Closing Date and to the extent such claims are made

this Agreement shall remain in effect.

(iii) The Seller and its Affiliates will have no liability for any Adverse
Consequences, unless and until the aggregate Adverse Consequences for which
the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to recover under this Agreement exceeds an
amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Threshold
Amount_ "); _provided, however_ , once such amount exceeds the Threshold
Amount, the Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover all amounts to which
they are entitled in excess of the Threshold Amount. In addition, in
calculating the Threshold Amount or the Adverse Consequences under
this Agreement, all Adverse Consequences which individually total less than
$50,000 shall be excluded in their entirety and the Seller and its Affiliates
shall have no liability hereunder to the Buyer Indemnitees for such Adverse
Consequences until the total of such individual Adverse Consequences exceeds
$500,000 in the aggregate, after which all such sums in excess of $500,000
shall be counted toward the Threshold Amount; also provided that for purposes
of this sentence, the Adverse Consequences from any events or actions
resulting from the same or substantially similar occurrences shall be
aggregated. The limitations on the Sellers indemnification obligations set
forth in this


Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 26 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

subparagraph (iii) shall not apply to losses resulting from matters directly
associated with indemnification claims made by the Buyer pursuant to

_8.2(a)(vi)_.

(iv) The Seller and its Affiliates shall not be liable to the Buyer
Indemnitees for any Adverse Consequences associated with a claim that is based
upon any fact, matter or circumstance which before the Closing had been
communicated to the Buyer, the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates in
writing or contained in the Disclosure Schedule.

(v) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the indemnification
provisions in this _Article VIII_ and the termination rights in _Section 10.1_
hereof shall be the exclusive remedies of the Buyer, the Buyer Indemnitees
and their Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the prior sentence, the Buyer hereby waives any
claim or cause of action pursuant to common or statutory law or otherwise
against the Seller and its Affiliates with respect to Adverse Consequences or
Obligations of any nature whatsoever that relate to this Agreement or are
attributable to the Shares, the Acquired Companies, the Subject Assets or the
ownership and operation of the Acquired Companies, whether arising before, on
or after the Closing Date.

**8.3** _ ** Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller**_
**.**

(a) _General Indemnity_. The Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
the Seller Indemnitees harmless from and against and in respect of Adverse
Consequences actually suffered, incurred or realized by such party arising
out of or resulting from or relating to:

(i) breaches by the Buyer of any of its representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein for which there is an applicable survival period
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ and the Seller Indemnitee makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to _Section 11.6_ within such
survival period;

(ii) (A) Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any Post-Closing Tax
Periods, any portion of a Straddle Period commencing after the Closing Date
and one-half of the Taxes described in _Section 9.7_ hereof, (B) all liability
for Taxes resulting from any transaction involving the Company that occurs on
the Closing Date but after the Closing that is not pursuant to this Agreement,
and (C) any liability for Taxes attributable to a breach by the Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) the Shares, the Acquired Companies, the Subject Assets or the
ownership of the Acquired Companies or operation of the Businesses, whether
arising before, on or after the Closing Date but excluding those liabilities
for which the Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ hereof. THE BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
THIS INDEMNIFICATION MAY INCLUDE AN INDEMNIFICATION OF THE SELLER INDEMNITIES
FOR AND AGAINST EACH OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE.

**8.4** _ ** Matters Involving Third Parties**_ **.**

(a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_
") with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that may give rise
to a right to claim for indemnification against any other Party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ , then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof in writing.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party _; provided, however,_ that
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 27 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement
involves only the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction
or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall provide reasonable assistance to and cooperation with the Indemnifying
Party in connection with any Third Party Claim.

(c) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 8.4(b)_ , the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate.

**8.5** _ ** Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences**_ **.**
The Adverse Consequences giving rise to any indemnification obligation
hereunder shall be limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified
Party (i.e., reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
events giving rise to the claim for indemnification), net of any reduction in
Taxes of the Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a
member) occasioned by such loss or damage. Upon the request of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party
with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the
amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this _Section 8.5_. An
Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in
respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use
reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim
and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount
thereof.

 

 **8.6** _ ** Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments**_ **.** All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment made
under _Article VIII_ , shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for Tax
purposes.

**8.7** _ ** Subrogation**_ **.** If an Indemnified Party has a right
against a third party with respect to any claim, demand, action or proceeding
for which indemnification is sought under this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall, to the extent of any payment made by the Indemnifying Party, be
subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party or parties and the
Indemnified Party or parties shall cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying
Party in pursuing the claim against the third party. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party or parties shall assign, or
partially assign, the claim or action against the third party to the
Indemnifying Party, to the extent of any payment made by the Indemnifying
Party.

**8.8** _ ** Limitation of Damages**_ **.** **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
CONTAINED TO THE CONTRARY IN ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY, AND THE
RECOVERY BY ANY PARTY OR INDEMNITEE OF ANY COVERED LIABILITIES SUFFERED OR
INCURRED BY IT AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH OR NONFULFILLMENT BY A PARTY OF ANY
OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OTHER
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES AND SHALL
NOT INCLUDE OR APPLY TO, NOR SHALL ANY PARTY OR INDEMNITEE BE ENTITLED TO
RECOVER, ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST
PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY ANY
PARTY OR INDEMNITEE**. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may,
however, include indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive
damages to the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise
to such damages are incurred or suffered by a third party who is not an
Affiliate


Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 28 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

of the Seller or the Buyer and (ii) such damages are recovered against an
Indemnitee by a Person which is a third party who is not an Affiliate of the
Seller or the Buyer. This _Section 8.8_ shall operate only to limit a Partys
liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any contractual
obligation of a Party hereunder.

** ARTICLE IX** 
 **TAX MATTERS**

**9.1** _ ** Post-Closing Tax Returns**_ **.** The Buyer shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed any Post-
Closing Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies. The Buyer shall pay (or shall
cause to be paid) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. For purposes
of this _Article IX_ , "timely" filings shall include all
applicable extensions of the filing deadlines.

**9.2** _ ** Pre-Closing Tax Returns**_ **.** The Seller shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Pre-
Closing Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies. The Seller shall pay (or
cause to be paid) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

**9.3** _ ** Straddle Periods**_ **.** The Buyer shall be responsible
for Taxes shown as due on the Straddle Returns of the Acquired Companies
related to the portion of any Straddle Period commencing after the Closing
Date. The Seller shall be responsible for Taxes shown as due on Straddle
Returns of the Acquired Companies relating to the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date. With respect to any Straddle Period, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller or the Buyer shall elect to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax period. If applicable Law
will not permit the Closing Date to be the last day of a period, then (i) real
or personal property Taxes of the Acquired Companies shall be allocated based
on the number of days in the partial period before and after the Closing Date,
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes based on or in respect of income, the Tax
computed on the basis of the taxable income or loss of the Acquired Companies
for each partial period as determined from their books and records, and (iii)
in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of the actual activities or
attributes of the Acquired Companies for each partial period as determined
from their books and records.

**9.4** _ ** Straddle Returns**_ **.** The Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Straddle Returns of the
Acquired Companies. With respect to any Straddle Return, the Buyer shall
deliver, at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Straddle Return (including any extension) to the Seller a statement setting
forth the amount of Tax that the Seller owes, including the allocation of
taxable income and Taxes under _Section 9.3_ , and copies of such Straddle
Return. The Seller shall have the right to review such Straddle Returns and
the allocation of taxable income and liability for Taxes and to suggest to
the Buyer any reasonable changes to such Straddle Returns no later than
fifteen (15) days prior to the date for the filing of such Straddle Returns.
The Seller and the Buyer agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good
faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Returns and
allocation of taxable income and liability for Taxes and mutually to consent
to the filing by the Buyer as promptly as possible of such Straddle
Returns. Not later than five (5) days before the due date for the payment of
Taxes with respect to such Straddle Returns, the Seller shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes as agreed to by the Buyer
and the Seller as being owed by the Seller. If the Buyer and the Seller
cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the Seller with respect to a
Straddle Return, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of Taxes
reasonably determined by the Seller to be owed by the Seller. Within ten (10)
days after such payment, the Seller and the Buyer shall refer the matter to an
independent accounting firm agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller to arbitrate
the dispute. The Seller and the Buyer shall equally share the fees and
expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as to the amount owing
by the Seller with respect to a Straddle Return shall be binding on both the
Seller and the Buyer and shall be enforceable in a court of competent
jurisdiction. Within five days after the determination by such accounting
firm, if necessary, the appropriate Party shall



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 29 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

pay the other Party any amount which is determined by such accounting firm to
be owed. The Seller shall be entitled to reduce its obligation to pay
Taxes with respect to a Straddle Return by the amount of any estimated Taxes
paid with respect to such Taxes on or before the Closing Date.

**9.5** _ ** Claims for Refund**_ **.** The Buyer shall not, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies and any of its Affiliates not, to file any claim
for refund of Taxes with respect to the Acquired Companies for whole or
partial Taxable periods on or before the Closing Date, unless the refund is
for Taxes for a Straddle Period.

**9.6** _ ** Cooperation on Tax Matters**_ **.**

(a) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this  _Article IX_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller shall (i) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies
relating to any whole or partial Taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Buyer or any Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing authority, and (ii) give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Buyer or any Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and
records.

(b) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including,
but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

**9.7** _ ** Transfer Taxes**_ **.** The Buyer will file (after
appropriate review by the Seller) all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all transfer (including without limitation,
stock transfer), recording, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other similar taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, the Seller
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation. The Buyer and Seller will share equally, any
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar taxes
fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement (excluding those related to the Excluded
Assets, which shall be the responsibility of the Seller).

**9.8** _ ** Confidentiality**_ **.** Any information shared in
connection with Taxes shall be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund
claims, Tax audits, Tax claims and Tax litigation, or as required by Law.

**9.9** _ ** Audits**_ **.** The Seller and the Buyer shall provide
prompt written notice to the others of any pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to the Acquired
Companies for whole or partial periods for which it may be indemnified by the
other party hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and
shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received from
or with any Tax authority in respect of any such matters. If an Indemnified
Party has knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter for
which it may be indemnified hereunder and such party fails to give the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, then (a) if
the Indemnifying Party is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from
contesting the asserted Tax liability in any forum, the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 30 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

for any Taxes arising out of such asserted Tax liability, and (b) if the
Indemnifying Party is not so precluded from contesting, but such failure
to give prompt notice results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then
any amount which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ shall be reduced by the
amount of such detriment, provided, the Indemnified Party shall nevertheless
be entitled to full indemnification hereunder to the extent, and only to the
extent, that such party can establish that the Indemnifying Party was
not prejudiced by such failure. _Section 9.10_ hereof shall control the
procedure for Tax indemnification matters to the extent it is inconsistent
with any other provision of this Agreement.

**9.10** _ ** Control of Proceedings**_ **.** The Party responsible for
the Tax under this Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such
Taxes (including action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). The
Seller and the Buyer shall jointly control, in good faith with each other,
audits and disputes relating to Straddle Periods. Reasonable out of pocket
expenses with respect to such contests shall be borne by the Seller and the
Buyer in proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth in
this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the
noncontrolling party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate
in such proceedings at its own expense.

**9.11** _ ** Powers of Attorney**_ **.** The Buyer, the Acquired
Companies, and their Affiliates shall provide the Seller and its Affiliates
with such powers of attorney or other authorizing documentation as are
reasonably necessary to empower them to execute and file Tax returns they are
responsible for hereunder, file refund and equivalent claims for Taxes they
are responsible for, and contest, settle, and resolve any audits and disputes
that they have control over under _Section 9.10_ hereof (including any refund
claims which turn into audits or disputes).

**9.12** _ ** Remittance of Refunds**_ **.** If the Buyer or any
Affiliate of the Buyer (including the Acquired Companies) receives a refund of
any Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a
Straddle Period that the Seller is responsible for hereunder, or if the Seller
or any Affiliate of the Seller (other than the Acquired Companies) receives a
refund of any Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period or the portion
of a Straddle Period that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the party
receiving such refund shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
refund, remit it to the party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder.
For the purpose of this _Section 9.12_ , the term " _refund_ " shall include
a reduction in Tax and the use of an overpayment as a credit or other tax
offset, and receipt of a refund shall occur upon the filing of a return or an
adjustment thereto using such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the
receipt of cash.

**9.13** _ ** Closing Tax Certificate**_ **.** At the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver, and cause each of the Acquired Companies to deliver, to
the Buyer a certificate in the form of  _Exhibit 9.13_ hereto pursuant to
Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2). At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a
statement providing its U.S. Employment Identification Number and its
address.

**9.14** _ ** Section 338 Elections**_ **.**

(a) The Seller and the Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall make (i)
the joint elections provided for in Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d) with respect to the Acquired
Companies and (ii) such other similar elections under the laws of any state
or local jurisdiction analogous to the election provided for in Section
338(h)(10) of the Code, which elections specifically exclude any election
under the laws of any state or local jurisdiction comparable to the election
under Section 338(g) of the Code in the absence of an election under the laws
of such state or local jurisdictions comparable to the election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (the elections described in (i) and
(ii), collectively, the " _Section 338 Elections_ "). The Seller and the
Buyer shall comply fully with all filing and other requirements necessary to
effectuate the Section 338 Elections on a timely



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 31 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

basis and agree to cooperate in good faith with each other in the preparation
and timely filing of any Tax returns required to be filed in connection
with the making of the Section 338 Elections, including the exchange of
information and the joint preparation and filing of all required Tax forms and
schedules.

(b) The Buyer shall not, for federal income Tax purposes, make any
election under Section 338(g) of the Code in the absence of joining the Seller
in making a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code. The Seller
and the Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to agree upon the fair market value
of the assets of the Acquired Companies for purposes of Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date. In the
event such agreement is reached, neither the Seller nor the Buyer (nor any of
their respective Affiliates), unless required pursuant to a final
determination, shall take any position on any Tax return or with any taxing
authority that is inconsistent with such agreement. In the event the Seller
and the Buyer are unable to reach an agreement within such one hundred twenty
(120) days the Parties shall submit such dispute to the Accountants for
a final determination (utilizing procedures similar to those set forth in
_Section 2.6_ hereof) which shall be binding on the Parties. If a party
proposes a settlement or other final disposition of a contest inconsistent,
in whole or in part, with such agreement, such party shall contest the matter
further if requested by the other party, provided that such other party agrees
to bear the expense of such further contest.

(c) The parties agree to comply with the reporting and filing
requirements of Temp. Treas. Reg. §§1.6043-3T and 1.6043-4T (as published in
Treas. Dec. 9022), if necessary.

** ARTICLE X**

terminate this Agreement, as provided below:

(a) the Buyer and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time before the Closing;

(b) subject to the provisions of subsection (d) below, the Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Seller at any time
before Closing if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February
28, 2003 or such later date as the Parties agree in writing (the "
_Termination Date_ ") (unless the failure to close is due (i)primarily to the
Buyer breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or (ii) to the waiting period referred to in the HSR Act applicable
to this transaction having not expired or been terminated as of the February
28, 2003);

(c) subject to the provisions of subsection (d) below, the Seller may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer at any time
before the Closing if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the

Seller breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or (ii) to the waiting period referred to in the HSR Act applicable
to this transaction having not expired or been terminated as of the February
28, 2003);

(d) in the event the waiting period referred to in the HSR Act
applicable to this transaction has not expired or is not terminated as of the

enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable.

**10.2** _ ** Effect of Termination**_ **.** If any Party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , all rights and obligations of
the Parties with respect to any Shares not theretofore sold to the Buyer
hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other
Party (except for any liability of any Party then in breach); provided that
the confidentiality provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive termination.

** ARTICLE XI** 
 **MISCELLANEOUS**

**11.1** _ ** Insurance**_ **.** The Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that, following the Closing, the Insurance Policies of the Acquired Companies
shall be terminated or modified to exclude coverage of all or any portion of
the Acquired Companies by the Seller or its Affiliates and, as a result, the
Buyer shall be obligated at or before Closing to obtain at its sole cost and
expense replacement insurance, including insurance required by any third
party to be maintained by the Acquired Companies. The Buyer further
acknowledges that the Seller only maintained such Insurance Policies
(including self insurance and deduction levels) that it deemed necessary in
its sole discretion or that were required by Law. The Buyer further
acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer may need to provide to certain
Governmental Authorities and third parties evidence of such replacement or
substitute insurance coverage for the continued operations of the Businesses
following the Closing. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section
11.1_ , if any insured losses occur subsequent to the date hereof but on or
before the Closing Date that relate solely to the Businesses and such claims,
or the claims associated with such losses, are properly made against the
policies retained by the Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section
11.1_  or under policies otherwise retained by the Seller or its Affiliates
after the Closing, then, subject to any limitations under the insurance
policies (including without limitation time restrictions on "claims made"
policies), the Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts so that the
Acquired Companies can file, notice, and otherwise continue to pursue these
claims pursuant to the terms of such policies; however nothing in this
Agreement shall require the Seller to maintain or to refrain from asserting
claims against or exhausting any retained policies and the Seller shall not be
required to proceed against any direct or indirect self-insured primary
insurance programs or policies of, or maintained by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including arrangement with carriers for claims administration
service under cost-plus reimbursement agreements, assumed retention,
deductible or retrospective rating plans or other plans or arrangements to the
extent that risk of loss thereunder is ultimately assumed or paid by the
Seller or its Affiliates.

**11.2** _ ** Press Releases and Public Announcements**_ **.** No Party
shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the
other Parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided
that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes, based upon the
opinion of counsel, is required by applicable Law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party will advise the other Parties before making the disclosure).

**11.3** _ ** No Third Party Beneficiaries**_ **.** This Agreement
shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

**11.4** _ ** Succession and Assignment**_ **.** This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the
prior written approval of the other Party.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but which together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

**11.6** _ ** Notices**_ **.** All notices, requests, demands, claims,
and other communications hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request,
demand, claim, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,

**11.7** _ ** Governing Law**_ **.** This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the state of Florida
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of such state or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than such state.

**11.8** _ ** Entire Agreement**_ **.** This Agreement (including the
documents referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or
representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they
have related in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement.. No amendment
of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Buyer and the Seller. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence to the contrary, this Agreement shall not alter, limit, modify,
impair, supercede or replace the Confidentiality Agreement.

**11.9** _ ** Severability**_ **.** Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.



Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 34 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

**11.10** _ ** Transaction Expenses**_ **.** Each of the Buyer and the
Seller will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

**11.11** _ ** Negotiation/Arbitration**_ **.**

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether sounding in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
including without limitation the meaning of its provisions, or the proper
performance of any of its terms by either Party, its breach, termination or
invalidity (a " _Dispute_ ") will be resolved in accordance with the
procedures specified in this _Section 11.11_ , which will be the sole and
exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such Dispute, except that a
Party, without prejudice to the following procedures, may file a complaint to
seek preliminary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief, if in its
sole judgment, that action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to
preserve the status quo. Despite such action the Parties will continue to
participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this _Section
11.11_.

(b) In the event any Dispute is not resolved in the ordinary course of
business any Party may provide written notice of the Dispute to the other
Party (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Dispute Notice shall include (i) a
statement of that Partys position and a summary of arguments supporting that
position, and (ii) the name and title of the executive who will
represent that Party, and of any other person who will accompany the
executive, in the negotiations concerning such Dispute. The Parties will
attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within forty five (45) days of
the Dispute Notice by negotiation between executives who have authority to
settle the Dispute and who are at a higher level of management than the
persons with direct responsibility for administration of this Agreement or the
matter in Dispute. Within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Dispute
Notice, the receiving Party will submit to the other a written response which
will include (i) a statement of that Partys position and a summary of
arguments supporting that position, and (ii) the name and title of the
executive who will represent that Party, and of any other person who will
accompany the executive, in the negotiations concerning the Dispute. Within
forty five (45) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the executives of
both Parties will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and
thereafter, as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve
the Dispute.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
agreed among the Parties, as a severable and independent arbitration agreement
separately enforceable from the remainder of this Agreement, that if the
Parties, their Indemnitees or the respective successors, assigns, or legal
representatives of any of the foregoing are unable to amicably resolve any
Dispute pursuant to _Section 11.11(b)_ above if the amount in controversy
(excluding interest and attorney fees) is less than an amount equal to two
percent (2%) of the Purchase Price, then such matter shall be finally and
exclusively referred to and settled by arbitration under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). In the
event of any conflict between the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA and
the provisions of this _Section 11.11_ , then provisions of this _Section
11.11_ shall govern and control.

(d) The arbitration shall be heard and determined by three (3)
arbitrators. Each side shall appoint an arbitrator of its choice within
fifteen (15) days of the submission of a notice of arbitration. The party-
appointed arbitrators shall in turn appoint a presiding arbitrator of the
tribunal within fifteen (15) days following the appointment of both party-
appointed arbitrators. If the party-appointed arbitrators cannot reach
agreement on a presiding arbitrator of the tribunal and/or one party fails or
refuses to appoint its party-appointed arbitrator within the prescribed
period, the appointing authority for the presiding arbitrator and/or such
party-appointed arbitrator shall be the AAA, who, in each case, shall appoint
an independent arbitrator who does not have any financial interest in the
dispute,


Stock Purchase Agreement 
Page 35 of 38 ##### Table of Contents

 

controversy or claim or bear any relationship to either party. If an
arbitrator should die, withdraw or otherwise become incapable of serving, or
refuse to serve, a successor arbitrator shall be selected and appointed in
the same manner as the original arbitrator.

(e) Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the parties to the
arbitration proceedings:

(i) The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Miami, Florida;

(ii) The arbitrators shall be and remain at all times wholly independent
and impartial;

(iii) The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as amended from time to time;

(iv) Any procedural issues not determined under the arbitration rules
selected pursuant to  _Section 11.11(e)(iii)_ hereof shall be determined by
the arbitration act and any other Laws of the State of Florida, other than
those laws which would refer the matter to another jurisdiction;

 

(v) All decisions and awards by the arbitration tribunal shall be made by
majority vote;

(vi) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be reduced to
writing; shall be final and binding without the right of appeal; and shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or
accountings presented to the arbitrators; any damage awards by the arbitrators
shall be promptly paid free of any deduction or offset; and any costs or fees
incident to enforcing the award shall to the maximum extent permitted by law
be charged against the party resisting such enforcement;

(vii) Consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or other
similar damages shall not be allowed except those payable to third parties
(and permitted under _Section 8.8_ hereof) for which liability is allocated
among the parties by the arbitration award;

(viii) Any award of damages shall include interest from the date of any
breach or violation of this Agreement, as determined by the arbitration award,
and from the date of the award until paid in full, at 7% per annum;

(ix) The fees for each party appointed arbitrator shall be borne by the
party appointing such arbitrator. The fees for the presiding arbitrator and
any related expenses of the arbitration proceedings (excluding attorneys fees
and costs but including any fees or expenses of the AAA) shall be borne
equally by the parties to the Dispute;

(x) Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the person or the assets of the party owing the judgment, or
application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award
and an order of enforcement, as the case may be;

(xi) The arbitration shall proceed in the absence of a party who, after
due notice, fails to answer or appear; an award shall not be made solely on
the default of a party, but the arbitrator(s) shall require the party who is
present to submit such evidence as the arbitrator(s) may determine is
reasonably required to make an award.

**11.12** _ ** Force Majeure**_ **.** If as a result of (i) act of God,
including, without limitation, epidemic, hurricane, tornado, typhoon,
earthquake, cyclone or flood; (ii) war, revolution, civil commotion, general
strike, act of enemies or terrorist, blockade or embargo, or (iii) fire,
explosion or other casualty or accident not fully insured or (iv) other
similar occurrences or acts beyond the reasonable control of a Party hereto,
a Party hereto affected thereby is unable to perform, in any material
respect, its obligations as provided under, and within the time required by,
_Article V_ and _Article VI_ hereof, the time required for such performance
shall be extended by the time period during which the Party is so affected but
not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. Should any such occurrence take
place, the affected party shall promptly provide the other party with notice
of the details and time of such occurrence and shall thereafter use
commercially reasonable efforts to remove, remedy, or resolve any effect
related to such occurrence. Any such occurrence shall not affect any
performance obligation of the affected party, including payment, not directly
related to or affected by such occurrence. Inability to make any payment (such
as insolvency) shall not constitute force majeure.
