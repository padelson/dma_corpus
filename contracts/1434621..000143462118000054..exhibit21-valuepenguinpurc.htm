statement (the "Closing Statement") that shall include a balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, a statement of the Net Adjustment Amount, and a
calculation of the following:

(i) the Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(ii) the Closing Indebtedness;

(iii) the Closing Cash on Hand; and

(iv) the Closing Working Capital.

(b) During the thirty (30) day period following Buyer's delivery of the
Closing Statement to the Sellers' Representative (the "Review Period"), Buyer
shall provide the Sellers' Representative and his Representatives reasonable
access to the relevant books and records and employees of the Acquired
Companies for the purpose of facilitating the Sellers' Representative's review
of the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding
on the Parties at the end of the last day of the Review Period, unless prior
to the end of the Review Period, the Sellers' Representative delivers to Buyer
a written notice of disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the
nature and amount of any and all items in dispute as to the amounts set forth
in the Closing Statement. The Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts in the Closing Statement not specifically
referenced in a Notice of Disagreement provided prior to the end of the Review
Period.

(c) During the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Sellers' Representative to Buyer (the "Resolution
Period"), such Parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the computation of the amounts
as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the
Sellers' Representative and Buyer within the Resolution Period shall be final
and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Sellers'
Representative and Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end of
the Resolution Period, the Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall submit, in
writing, such differences to the Accounting Expert. The "Accounting Expert"
shall be a Neutral Accounting Firm selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
the Sellers' Representative; provided, that: (i) if, within fifteen (15) days
after the end of the Resolution Period, such Parties are unable to agree on a
Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, then each Party shall
select a Neutral Accounting Firm and such firms together shall select the
Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Accounting Expert, and (ii) if any Party
does not select a Neutral Accounting Firm within ten (10) days of written
demand therefor by the other Party, then the Neutral Accounting Firm selected
by the other Party shall act as the Accounting Expert. A "Neutral Accounting
Firm" means an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing that is not at the time it is to be engaged hereunder rendering
services to any Party, or any Affiliate of either, and has not done so within
the two (2)-year period prior thereto.

(d) The Parties shall arrange for the Accounting Expert to agree in its
engagement letter to act in accordance with this Section 2.9(d). Each Party
shall present a brief to the Accounting Expert (which brief shall also be
concurrently provided to the other Party) within twenty (20) days of the
appointment of the Accounting Expert detailing such Party's views as to the
correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute from the Notice of
Disagreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, no Party may introduce a dispute
to the Accounting Expert that was not originally set forth on the Notice of
Disagreement). Within ten (10) days of receipt of the brief, the receiving
Party may present a responsive brief to the Accounting Expert (which
responsive brief shall also be concurrently provided to the other Party). Each
Party may make an oral presentation to the Accounting Expert (in which case,
such presenting Party shall notify the other Party of such presentation, and
the other Party shall have the right to be present (but not speak) at such
presentation), within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the Accounting
Expert. The Accounting Expert shall have the opportunity to present written
questions to either Party, a copy of which shall be provided to the other
Party. The Accounting Expert shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Sellers' Representative's and Buyer's respective calculations that are
identified as being items and amounts to which the Sellers' Representative and
Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Expert shall select either the position of Buyer or the Sellers'
Representative as a resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not
impose an alternative resolution with respect to any item or amount disputed.
The Accounting Expert shall make a written determination within sixty (60)
days of its appointment as to each such disputed item, which determination
shall be final and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder absent
manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Sellers (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share), on the one hand, and Buyer,
on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters
resolved by the Accounting Expert, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative Dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Accounting Expert at the
time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

(e) The Net Adjustment Amount, once finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.9, is referred to as the "Final Net Adjustment Amount".

Section 2.10. Post-Closing Payment.

(a) The "Net Adjustment Amount" shall equal zero (0):

(i) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Company Transaction
Expenses exceed the Estimated Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(ii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Company
Transaction Expenses exceed the Closing Company Transaction Expenses;

(iii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Indebtedness exceeds the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness;

(iv) plus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Indebtedness
exceeds the Closing Indebtedness;

(v) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Cash on Hand
exceeds the Closing Cash on Hand;

(vi) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Cash on Hand exceeds the
Estimated Closing Cash on Hand;

(vii) minus the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds the Closing Working Capital; and (viii) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds
the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the calculation of the Final Net
Adjustment Amount becomes final and binding on the Parties pursuant to Section
2.9:

(i) if the Final Net Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Sellers (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares) the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount and (B) Buyer
shall pay to Sellers (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount in cash
equal to the Final Net Adjustment Amount;

(ii) if the Final Net Adjustment Amount is negative and the positive integer
of the Final Net Adjustment Amount is equal to or less than the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
promptly disburse (A) to Buyer an amount equal to the Final Net Adjustment
Amount and (B) to Sellers (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares), the remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount; or

(iii) if the Final Net Adjustment Amount is negative and the positive integer
of the Final Net Adjustment Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, (A) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly
disburse the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount to Buyer and (B) Sellers (in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) shall pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount in cash equal to
the amount by which the positive integer of the Final Net Adjustment Amount is
greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

(c) Any payments or adjustments pursuant to this Article 2 shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price, including for U.S. federal income (and
other applicable) tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law.

accordance with, the Company's and its Subsidiaries' books and records in all
material respects.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain, adhere to

Section 4.9. No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for Liabilities (a)
specifically reflected or reserved for in any of the Financial Statements, (b)

The Business and the Excluded Businesses are the only businesses in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been engaged anywhere in the world. The

in operational condition, normal wear and tear excepted, have been regularly
and properly serviced and maintained in a manner that would not void or limit
the coverage of any warranty thereon, other than items currently under, or
scheduled for, repair or construction, and are adequate and fit to be used for
the purposes for which they are currently used in the manner they are
currently used. For clarity, the representations and warranties in this

financial institutions at which any Acquired Company maintains accounts of any
nature, the account numbers of all such accounts and the names of all persons
authorized to draw thereon or make withdrawals therefrom.

Section 4.13. Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 4.13(a) contains a list of all Patents, Marks, Copyrights, Domain
Names and all other United States and foreign registrations, issuances and
applications that constitute Intellectual Property owned or filed by any
Acquired Company (the "Registered Intellectual Property") together with a list
of all material unregistered trademarks, domain names and software developed
by or for any Acquired Company (the Intellectual Property set forth on
Schedule 4.13(a), collectively, the "Company Intellectual Property"),
including the applicable jurisdictions of issuance, all of which are to the
Knowledge of Sellers duly and validly subsisting and in the case of Registered
Intellectual Property, enforceable. The Acquired Companies owns all right,
title and interest, in and to the Company Intellectual Property, free and
clear of Liens other than Permitted Liens and licenses in the Ordinary Course.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(a), there are no filings or payments due

remains active and in good standing and without material risk of abandonment.

(b) Schedule 4.13(b) sets forth a complete list of all licenses, sublicenses
and other agreements concerning the Intellectual Property used in the conduct
of the Business under which the Company or any Subsidiary is a licensee or
otherwise is authorized to use any Intellectual Property other than the
Company Intellectual Property, except for shrink-wrap licenses or other
licenses for off-the-shelf Software with an annual license fee not exceeding
$5,000 (such Intellectual Property, "Licensed Intellectual Property"; such
licenses, sublicenses, agreements or permissions, together with all
amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, "IP Licenses"). The Company
has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of such IP Licenses. The
Acquired Companies are not in material breach of or in material default
(whether with or without the giving of notice, passage of time or both) under
any IP Licenses or in respect of any Licensed Intellectual Property, and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, no counterparty to any IP License is in material
breach or material default (whether with or without the giving of notice,
passage of time or both) under or in respect of any such IP License or
Licensed Intellectual Property.

(c) Schedule 4.13(c) sets forth a complete list of all Software (including
related documentation) that is material to any Acquired Company and that is
owned by or licensed to any Acquired Company other than commercially
available, off-the-shelf, non-customized Software (the "Company Software").
All right, title and interest in and to the Company Software is owned by the
Acquired Companies free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens
(excluding restrictions imposed by any license agreements disclosed on
Schedule 4.13(b) with any Licensed Intellectual Property as described in
subsection (ii) in such definition). Except for commonly available off-the-
shelf computer and workstation software programs, no Excluded Subsidiary or
any other Person (other than the Acquired Companies) holds, manages or
controls any Company Software or other software used in the operation of the
Business in any manner without the Acquired Companies' right and ability to
maintain unhindered and continuous useful operation of such software. The
Acquired Companies have taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented
commercially reasonable procedures, each consistent with industry practices
and standards, to ensure that the Company Software and internal computer
systems (consisting of hardware, software, databases or embedded control
systems, collectively with the Company Software, the "Company Systems") are
free from all disabling codes or instructions and all malware, viruses or
other intentionally created (by any Person) undocumented contaminants that
permit unauthorized access or the unauthorized disruption, impairment,
disablement or erasure of such Company Systems. The Acquired Companies, with
the Company Systems, have in place disaster recovery plans, procedures and
facilities and have taken commercially reasonable steps consistent with
industry practices and standards to safeguard the Company.

(d) The Acquired Companies currently hold all required licenses to use any
third party Software that is used in the conduct of the Business, and is in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements thereof, and such
licenses will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
immediately following the Closing. The Acquired Companies have not used,
modified or distributed any Publicly Available Software in a manner that
requires any Company Software to be: (i) disclosed or distributed in source
code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works or (iii)
redistributed at no charge.

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(e), during the past three (3) years
no written claim has been brought or made against any Acquired Company: (i)
alleging that the operation of the Business, or their use of any Intellectual
Property infringes on or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of, or
otherwise violates the rights of, another Person, including any requirement
that they take a license under or pay any consideration in respect of any
Intellectual Property of another Person; (ii) challenging the ownership, right
to use or validity of the Company Intellectual Property or the right to use or
validity of any Licensed Intellectual Property or (iii) opposing or attempting
to cancel any Acquired Company's rights in any Intellectual Property. No
Action is pending, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, against or
involving the Company with respect to any Intellectual Property. To the
Knowledge of Sellers, no Person is infringing upon, misappropriating or
otherwise violating the rights of any Acquired Company in Intellectual
Property owned by any Acquired Company. The operation of the Business as it
has been and currently is conducted has not and does not infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate in any manner the Intellectual Property or
other rights of any Person. (f) No current or former employee, consultant or contractor of any Acquired
Company has any right to payment with respect to any Acquired Company's use of
any Company Intellectual Property, or any right ownership with respect to any
Company Intellectual Property. Each current or former employee, consultant or
contractor of any Acquired Company that has contributed to the conception or
development of any Company Intellectual Property used by any Acquired Company
has executed an agreement assigning all rights in such Company Intellectual
Property to any Acquired Company, which agreement is valid and binding against
any Acquired Company, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, the
other party thereto, and has irrevocably waived in writing any non-assignable
rights (including moral rights) that such Person may possess with respect to
such Company Intellectual Property.

(g) The Acquired Companies have taken commercially reasonable measures to
protect the confidentiality of the Company Intellectual Property and other
proprietary information, including Trade Secrets, the value of which is
contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, and of third party
confidential information provided to any Acquired Company under an obligation
of confidentiality, including requiring all persons with access thereto to
sign nondisclosure agreements. No Company Intellectual Property constituting a
Trade Secret or Confidential Information that is material to the Business has
been authorized to be disclosed or has been disclosed by any Acquired Company
other than pursuant to a binding and enforceable nondisclosure agreement or
other obligation of confidentiality restricting the disclosure and use
thereof. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no Person has breached any such
nondisclosure agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to any Acquired
Company.

(h) The Company Intellectual Property (other than Software), together with the
other Intellectual Property (other than Software) owned by any Acquired
Company and the Licensed Intellectual Property, includes all of the material
Intellectual Property (other than Software) used in the operation of Business
as currently conducted. The Company Software, together with the other Software
owned by any Acquired Company and the Licensed Intellectual Property, includes
all of the Software used in the operation of the Business as currently
conducted. The Company is not infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise

Authorities and other third parties necessary to consummate the transactions

at or after the Closing without one or more consents or approvals, and such

remain in full force and effect at or after the Closing, then until such time
as such consents or approvals are obtained, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, (i) continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents or approvals and (ii) cooperate in any
reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide to Buyer and the

benefits thereunder or resulting therefrom) as to which such consents or
approvals have not been obtained or do not remain in full force and effect.

Section 6.4. Public Disclosure; Confidentiality.

(a) Any public announcement, press release or similar publicity with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be issued, if
at all, at such time and in such manner as Buyer determines; provided, that,
if such announcement is not required by applicable Law, the content of such
announcements shall be subject to the prior approval of the Sellers'
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Sellers' Representative
fails to timely respond to Buyer\'s request for such approval or comment, then
Buyer may proceed with issuing any such announcement, press release or similar
publicity.

(b) Except with the prior written consent of Buyer or the Sellers'
Representative, as applicable, or as permitted by this Agreement, none of the
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall disclose to any Person: (i) the fact that any confidential information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been disclosed to Buyer or its
Representatives, or that any confidential information of Buyer has been
disclosed to the Company, Sellers or the Sellers' Representative or (ii) any
information about the transactions contemplated hereby, including the status
of such discussions or negotiations, the execution of any documents (including
this Agreement) or any of the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the related documents (including this Agreement); provided, that the foregoing
restrictions shall not prohibit disclosure of any such information by any
Party or its Representative: (A) if required by applicable Law or the rules of
any stock exchange on which Buyer's or its Affiliates' Equity Interests are
listed, (B) as required in order to fulfill such Party's obligations under
this Agreement, (C) to any financial, legal or accounting advisor for the
purpose of advising in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents (provided, that such advisor is made aware of and
directed to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b)) or (D) in
connection with any Action with respect to any of the Transaction Documents.
In the event of a disclosure by any Party or any of his, her or its
Representatives (x) to a Person permitted by clauses (B), (C) or (D) of the
immediately preceding sentence, such Party or Representative shall be liable
for any subsequent disclosure or misuse by Person in breach of this Section
6.4(b), or (y) under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, such
Person shall promptly notify the Sellers' Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, in writing to the extent permitted by Law, which notification
shall include the nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the
required disclosure, and such Person shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer or
the Sellers' Representative, as applicable (at such Person's expense) to
preserve the confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable
Law.

(c) Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, Sellers shall not, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to,
disclose, furnish, disseminate, make available or use any of the Acquired
Companies' Confidential Information, whatever its nature and form and without
limitation as to when or how Sellers or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives may have acquired such information. In the event that any
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is required by Law to
disclose any such Confidential Information, such Seller shall (A) promptly
notify Buyer in writing unless prohibited by Law, (B) cooperate with Buyer, at
Buyer's expense, to preserve, to the extent possible, the confidentiality of
such Confidential Information and (C) only disclose that portion of such
Confidential Information that, upon advice of counsel, is legally required to
disclose. Each Seller specifically acknowledges that all such Confidential
Information, whether reduced to writing, maintained on any form of electronic
media or maintained in the mind or memory of any Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives, and whether compiled by an Acquired Company, an Excluded
Subsidiary or any Seller, derives independent economic value from not being
readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain
economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been
made by the Acquired Companies to maintain the secrecy of such information,
that such information is the sole property of the Acquired Companies and that
any retention and use of such information by any Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives will constitute a misappropriation of the Acquired Companies
trade secrets.

(d) The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, then the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.5. Exclusive Dealing. During the Pre-Closing Period, Sellers grant
to Buyer the exclusive right to acquire the Shares. Sellers shall not, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer
from any Person relating to the acquisition of the Shares or any Equity
Interests or any substantial portion of the assets of any Acquired Company
(including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share
exchange) or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
furnishing any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing if
any Person makes any verbal or written proposal, offer, inquiry or contact
with respect to any of the foregoing, but shall not be obligated to disclose
the identity of the Person making, or disclose the terms of, such proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact. Section 6.6. Non-Competition.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), each of
J. Wu, Quinn and Pen (each, a "Restricted Party") shall not, and shall cause
each of their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) acquire, own,
manage, operate, join, control, participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of or engage in, consult with or perform services for,
lend money or capital to, invest capital in, or be connected in any manner
with, including as a partner or through ownership of Equity Interests in, any
business or Person (other than ownership of Equity Interests in Buyer or any
of its Affiliates) that engages anywhere in the world (the "Restricted
Territory") that competes with the Business or (ii) become employed by or
otherwise render personal services to any Person (other than Buyer or any of
its Affiliates) that competes with the Business; provided, that nothing in
this Agreement will prohibit any Restricted Party's ability to (A) make or
maintain passive investments of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding
equity of a Person so long as such Restricted Party or Affiliate, as
applicable, has no active participation in connection with the business of
such Person, (B) continue after the Closing to own or operate the businesses
described in clauses (a) and (b) of the definition of "Excluded Businesses",
subject to the scope and geographic limitations set forth in such definition,
or (C) with respect to the Restricted Parties who are members of the board of
directors of NimbleFins as of the Closing Date, continue to serve as board
members of NimbleFins for so long as such board membership is required by
applicable Laws.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, each Restricted Party and V. Wu shall
not, and shall cause each of their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit or offer employment to any individual who is an employee of any
Acquired Company or otherwise induce or attempt to induce (whether for their
own account or for the account of any other Person) any individual who is an
employee of any Acquired Company to leave the employ of Buyer, its Affiliates
or any Acquired Company; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall
prohibit any Restricted Party from: (i) using general solicitations (including
through search firms) not targeted at employees of any Acquired Company, or
employing any individual who responds to such solicitation; (ii) hiring,
employing or discussing employment with any individual who contacts such
Restricted Party independently without any solicitations by such Restricted
Party or (iii) soliciting any individual who has left the employment of Buyer,
its Affiliates or any Acquired Company at least twelve (12) months prior to
such Restricted Party soliciting such individual.

(c) During the Non-Competition Period, each Restricted Party shall not, and
shall cause each of their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, induce or
attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation
of any Acquired Company to cease doing business with Buyer, any Acquired
Company or any of their respective Affiliates or in any way interfere with the
relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business
relation and Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates.

(d) Each Restricted Party agrees that such Restricted Party's obligations
under this Section 6.6 are special and unique and that any violation thereof
would not be adequately compensated by money damages, and each expressly
grants Buyer the right to specifically enforce (including injunctive relief
where appropriate) the terms of this Section 6.6.

(e) The obligations contained in this Section 6.6 shall be construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each country, state, city or other
political subdivision of the Restricted Territory. If any of such separate
covenants (or any part thereof) is deemed invalid or unenforceable, Buyer and
the Restricted Parties agree that such invalid or unenforceable covenant (or
such part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.
If any of the provisions of this Section 6.6 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and the
Restricted Parties agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum
time, geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 6.7. Release.

(a) Each Seller, on behalf of such Seller and such Seller's Affiliates, hereby
releases and discharges, effective as of the Closing Date, each Acquired
Company from any and all Actions, cross-claims, counter claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive or
exemplary damages, claims for costs and attorney's fees, or Liabilities of any
nature whatsoever in law or equity, whether known or unknown, liquidated or
contingent, which such Seller and such Affiliate ever had, now has or may have
relating to, arising out of or in any way connected with the dealings of any
Acquired Company and such Seller or Affiliate or any circumstance, agreement,
action, omission, event or matter occurring or existing between them, in each
case, on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Released Claims");
provided, that the Released Claims shall not include (i) any matters arising
under or relating to the terms, conditions or other provisions or obligations
under the Transaction Documents, (ii) rights to any accrued but unpaid
compensation owed by the Company to Sellers as of the Closing to the extent
included in Closing Working Capital, (iii) rights to any accrued but unpaid
business expenses of Sellers to the extent that such expenses are reimbursable
under the Company's existing company policies and actually included as a
Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, or (iv)
rights under any benefit plan maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the
Company as of the Closing.

(b) Each Party acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide substantially
the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR
HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Each Party acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a Party
from waiving claims which such Party does not know exist or may exist.
Nonetheless, each Party agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, each
Party shall be deemed to waive any such provision.

(c) Each Party further agrees that no Party shall, nor permit any Affiliate
thereof to: (i) institute an Action based upon, arising out of, or relating to
any of the Released Claims, (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in any such
proceeding or (iii) encourage, assist and/or solicit any third party to
institute an Action.

Section 6.8. Access to Records after Closing. For a period of seven (7) years
after the Closing Date (or, in the case of Tax Returns and other Tax records,
seven (7) years after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
if shorter), each Seller and its Representatives shall have reasonable access
to all of the books and records of any Acquired Company, to the extent that
such access may reasonably be required in connection with matters relating to
or affected by the operations of any Acquired Company prior to the Closing
Date, including the preparation of such Seller's Tax Returns, any Tax audits,
the defense or prosecution of Actions (other than disputes with or against
Buyer and its Affiliates), and any other reasonable need of such Seller to
consult such books and records. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. If
Buyer or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall desire to
dispose of any of such books or records prior to the expiration of such seven
(7)-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give the Sellers'
Representative a reasonable opportunity to segregate and remove such books and
records as the Sellers' Representative may select.

Section 6.9. Tax Matters.

(a) (i) At the option of Buyer, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly make, or cause
to be jointly made, one or more elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding election under applicable state or local Law) with
respect to Buyer's acquisition of the Company pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election").

(ii) In the event that Buyer elects to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, (A)
Sellers and the Sellers' Representative shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all Tax Returns and other Tax forms and documentation,
including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 (and any other returns, forms or
documentation required under applicable state or local Law to effectuate the
Section 338(h)(10) Election) (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election
Forms"), (B) Buyer and Sellers shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed,
all Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms with the applicable Governmental
Authority, and Buyer and Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates
not to, revoke or modify any Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms, without the
prior written consent of Buyer or the Sellers' Representative, as applicable,
(C) Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistent with the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election and (D) Buyer and Sellers shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, take any position on any Tax Return, in any Tax Contest or
otherwise before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or
contrary to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, except in the case
of this clause (D) as otherwise required by a determination within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code (or applicable state or local Law).

(iii) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.9(a)(ii)(A), prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall agree on the form and content of, and Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing two duly executed IRS Forms 8023 (and
any other applicable state or local Tax forms) that reflect the Section
338(h)(10) Election. For clarity, Sellers shall deliver such IRS Forms 8023
(and other Tax forms) to Buyer at the Closing whether or not, as of the
Closing, Buyer has elected to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(iv) In the event that Buyer elects to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election,
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared an allocation of the Purchase
Price (and other relevant amounts for applicable Tax purposes) among the
assets of the Company and, if applicable, any other Acquired Company for U.S.
federal income (and other applicable) Tax purposes in accordance with Sections
338 and 1060 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder and other
applicable Law (the "Allocation"). Such Allocation as prepared by Buyer in
good faith shall be final and binding on the Parties and the Parties shall
prepare and file, and cause their Affiliates to prepare and file, all Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with such Allocation (including IRS Forms 8883)
and the Parties shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, take any
position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority or otherwise
that is inconsistent with such Allocation, except as required by applicable
Law. The Allocation may be adjusted from time to time by Buyer to take into
account any amount treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
applicable Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the methodology used in
the Allocation.

(v) In the event that Buyer elects to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election,
Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers' Representative the Tax
Gross Up Amount within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Tax
Gross Up Amount pursuant to this Section 6.9(a)(v). Within thirty (30) days
after the Company files its final IRS Form 1120S (or, if a dispute with
respect to such IRS Form 1120S is submitted to the Accounting Expert pursuant
to Section 6.9(b)(i), within thirty (30) days after the Accounting Expert's
determination), the Sellers' Representative shall prepare in good faith and
deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth the Sellers' Representative's
calculation of the Tax Gross Up Amount and all Tax Returns (including relevant
income Tax Returns of Sellers), work papers and supporting materials or
information. If Buyer objects to the Sellers' Representative's calculation of
the Tax Gross Up Amount within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of such
schedule, then Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall endeavor in good
faith for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such objection to
resolve any disputes with respect thereto. In the event that Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative are not able to resolve all such disputes within such
30-day period (or such longer period as mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative), then either Buyer or the Sellers' Representative may
at any time thereafter submit any remaining disputed items to the Accounting
Expert for resolution in a manner consistent with procedures set forth in
Section 2.9(d), and the schedule as revised to reflect the determination of
the Accounting Expert shall become final and binding on the Parties. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Gross Up Amount" means an amount equal to the
sum of (A) the excess, if any, of (I) the Taxes paid by Sellers that includes
the Closing Date over (II) the Taxes Sellers would have paid if a Section
338(h)(10) Election were not made with respect to Buyer's acquisition of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement and (B) an amount necessary to pay any
additional Taxes (on an after-Tax basis) incurred by the Sellers as a result
of receiving the Tax Gross Up Amount; provided, that the Tax Gross Up Amount
shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.9(a)(v). The intent of the Tax Gross Up Amount is to put the Sellers
in the same after-tax position as if the Sellers had sold stock of the Company
and no Section 338(h)(10) Election had been made. Once paid, the Tax Gross Up
Amount shall not be subject to any adjustments (including in the event of a
subsequent Tax audit or otherwise), except that, in the event that the IRS
determines that the Company or ValuePenguin OpCo was not a valid "S
corporation" or as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary," respectively, within
the meaning of Section 1361 and 1362 of the Code as of the Closing and
invalidates the Section 338(h)(10) Election, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to any Tax Gross Up Amount paid to Sellers pursuant to this
Section 6.9(a)(v). The payments, if any, pursuant to this Section 6.9(a)(v)
shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income
(and other applicable) tax purposes, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. (b) (i) At Sellers' sole expense, the Sellers' Representative shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns of any Acquired Company for
taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date for which the original
due date (including extensions) is after the Closing Date, which includes, for
clarity, the final IRS Form 1120S of the Company (the "Seller Returns"). Each
such Seller Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's
past practice except as otherwise required by Law or this Agreement, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative shall timely pay to Buyer an amount equal to any Taxes
reflected as due and payable on all such Seller Returns not less than five (5)
days prior to the due date for such Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are
not expressly reflected as a Liability in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined. The Sellers' Representative shall deliver to
Buyer, for Buyer's review and comment, each such Seller Return at least forty-
five (45) days prior to its due date (or if such Seller Return is due in fewer
than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, then as soon after the
Closing Date as is reasonably practicable). Buyer shall provide any written
comments on each such Seller Return within twenty (20) days of receipt of such
Seller Return, and the Sellers' Representative shall consider in good faith
any such comments that are reasonable. The Sellers' Representative shall
deliver to Buyer (not less than five (5) days prior to the applicable filing
date for any such Seller Return), and Buyer shall file or cause to be filed,
any Seller Return as finally prepared pursuant to this Section 6.9(b)(i).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.9(b)(i), in the
event that Buyer elects to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, if Buyer
provides written comments to the Sellers' Representative with respect to the
final IRS Form 1120S of the Company that Buyer believes could reasonably be
expected to affect the Tax Gross Up Amount within twenty (20) days after
receipt of such Seller Return by Buyer, then Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall endeavor in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days
after receipt of such comments to resolve any disputes with respect thereto.
In the event that Buyer and the Sellers' Representative are not able to
resolve all such disputes in such 30-day period, then either Buyer or the
Sellers' Representative may at any time thereafter submit any remaining
disputed items to the Accounting Expert for resolution in a manner consistent
with procedures set forth in Section 2.9. If all disputes with respect to such
Seller Return are not resolved prior to the due date (including extensions)
for such Seller Return, then such Seller Return shall be filed as prepared by
the Sellers' Representative, and such Seller Return shall be amended or
otherwise refiled to reflect the determination of the Accounting Expert.

(ii) The Company, at the Company's sole expense, shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of any Acquired Company, other
than the Seller Returns, for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle
Period) which are to be filed by any Acquired Company after the Closing Date
(the "Company Returns"). Each such Company Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Company's past practice except as otherwise
required by Law or this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, and Sellers or the Sellers' Representative shall timely pay to
Buyer not less than five (5) days prior to the due date for such Taxes, in the
case of any such Company Return for a Tax period ending on or before the
Closings Date, all Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Company
Returns or, in the case of any such Company Return for a Straddle Period, the
portion of Taxes reflected as due and payable on all such Company Returns that
are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, to the extent that
such Taxes are not expressly reflected as a Liability in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined. Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers' Representative, for Sellers' Representative's review and comment, any
Company Return that could reasonably be expected to result in an indemnity
obligation of Sellers for Taxes at least thirty (30) days (or such shorter
period as reasonably required by circumstances or the nature of the applicable
Tax Return) prior to its due date. The Sellers' Representative shall provide
any written comments on each such Company Return within fifteen (15) days (or
such shorter period as reasonably required by circumstances or the nature of
the applicable Tax Return) of receipt of such Company Return, and the Buyer
shall consider in good faith any such comments that are reasonable.

(iii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies) shall (A) amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant
an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return of
any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) make or change any Tax
election regarding an Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than in connection with the preparation of any Company Return pursuant to
Section 6.9(b)(ii)), (C) intentionally take any affirmative action to
surrender any right to claim a refund for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
which the Sellers are entitled to receive payment thereof, or (D) unless any
such filing is determined in good faith by Buyer to be required, file any Tax
Return of an Acquired Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in any
jurisdiction if the Acquired Company did not file a comparable Tax Return
involving similar Tax items in such jurisdiction in the immediately preceding
Tax period, or in each case without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such
action could reasonably be expected to result in Indemnified Taxes and except
as otherwise required by Law.

(c) Any refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) of Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (to the extent that such refunds (or
credits) are not reflected as an asset in the calculation of Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined) shall be for the account of Sellers and Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers' Representative an amount equal
to any such refunds (or credits) upon actual receipt of such refund in cash or
application of such credit actually to reduce other Taxes due and owing by
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates. If requested by Sellers'
Representative, Buyer shall take at Sellers' sole expense any reasonable
action necessary for an Acquired Company to promptly claim Tax refunds
(including filing amended Tax Returns or claims for refunds (or credits)) set
forth in Schedule 6.9(c), unless Buyer determines in good faith that no
reasonable basis exists for such refund. Any contrary provision of this
Section 6.9(c) notwithstanding, (i) in the event that any such refund (or
credit) is required to be repaid to a Governmental Authority, Sellers shall
repay an amount equal to such refund (or credit) to Buyer (plus any penalties,
interest, or other charges) within fifteen (15) days after repayment of such
refund (or credit) by Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates to such
Governmental Authority and (ii) the amount of any refund (or credit) that is
required to be paid to the Sellers' Representative (A) shall be reduced by the
amount of any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including Taxes) that Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates incur (or will incur) with
respect to such refund (or credit), and (B) shall not include any refund (or
credit) (which shall be for the benefit of Buyer, the Company or their
respective Affiliates) that (X) results from the carryback of any net
operating loss, capital loss or other Tax attribute generated or incurred in
any Tax period (or portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing
Date, (Y) is included in the computation of Closing Working Capital or (Z) any
Acquired Company is required to pay over to another Person under any Contract
executed on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
aggregate amount of the Tax refunds that may be paid to Sellers (including
interest and other payments made with respect thereto) shall in no event
exceed $2,000,000.

(d) (i) After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative,
respectively, shall inform the other Party in writing of the commencement of
any claim, audit, investigation, examination, or other proceeding relating to
Taxes (each, a "Tax Contest") against or with respect to any Acquired Company
relating in whole or in part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Buyer may
be entitled to indemnity from Sellers under this Agreement.

(ii) Subject to Section 6.9(d)(iii), after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
the exclusive right to represent the interests of the Acquired Companies in
any and all such Tax Contests; provided, that, to the extent that any such Tax
Contest could reasonably be expected to result in a Tax indemnification
Liability of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, (A) Buyer shall keep the
Sellers' Representative reasonably informed and consult in good faith with the
Sellers' Representative with respect to any such Tax Contest (and the Sellers'
Representative and its Tax counsel or Tax adviser, at Sellers' expense, will
be permitted to attend meetings with taxing authorities) and (B) Buyer shall
provide the Sellers' Representative with copies of all material
correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any taxing
authorities and shall otherwise keep the Sellers' Representative informed on a
reasonable basis of significant developments in such Tax Contest and of
material communications involving representatives of the taxing authorities.
Buyer shall not settle any such Tax Contest on a basis that would reasonably
be expected to result in an indemnification obligation of Sellers for Taxes,
unless the Sellers' Representative consents to such settlement, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iii) The Sellers' Representative shall, at Sellers' expense, control any Tax
Contest of an income Tax Return of the Company for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Contests
with respect to the S corporation status and the allocation of the Purchase
Price arising from the Section 338(h)(10) Election) or, if such Tax Contest
could reasonably be expected to result in a material indemnification
obligation of Sellers for Taxes, any other Tax Return of the Company for a Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date; provided, that the Sellers'
Representative shall (A) keep Buyer reasonably informed and consult in good
faith with Buyer with respect to any such Tax Contest (and Buyer and its Tax
counsel or Tax adviser, at Buyer's expense, shall be permitted to attend
meetings with taxing authorities), (B) provide Buyer with copies of all
material correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any
taxing authorities and shall otherwise keep Buyer informed on a reasonable
basis of significant developments in such Tax Contest and of material communications involving representatives of the taxing authorities, (C) if
such Tax Contest involves the validity of the Company's status as an "S
corporation" for U.S. federal income (or other applicable) tax purposes, take
no material action without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (D) not settle,
compromise or resolve any such Tax Contest without Buyer's prior written
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(iv) In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Section
6.9(d) and any provision of Section 7.6, this Section 6.9(d) shall control.

(e) Each Party shall cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate) on a reasonable basis, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Parties, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns and preparation for and defense against any Tax Contests pursuant to
this Section 6.9.

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
non-income Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Sellers, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the other hand,
when due, and the Company will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. The cost and expense of
preparing any such Tax Returns shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers,
on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer, on the other hand. Each
Party shall cooperate with each other Party to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any such Transfer Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections shall be payable by the Buyer.

Section 6.10. Further Assurances. Each of the Parties shall execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by any of the other
Parties to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.11. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Exculpation.

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers (or persons holding similar positions) of the Company,
who have the right to indemnification or exculpation by the Company
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") as provided in the Company's
Organizational Documents or in indemnification agreements set forth on
Schedule 4.23, in each case as they exist as of the date of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date. Without limiting
the foregoing, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company to, amend, modify or
terminate any Organizational Document or such indemnification agreement
regarding or related to such indemnification or exculpation matters in a
manner that would be materially adverse to the Covered Persons with respect to
pre-Closing periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall make any
claim for indemnification pursuant to any Acquired Company's Organizational
Documents with respect to any claim brought by any Buyer Indemnified Person
against any Seller or relating to any Transaction Document or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

(b) If the Company or its successors or assigns: (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company shall assume all of the obligations of the Company set
forth in this Section 6.11.

Section 6.12. Restructuring; Excluded Subsidiaries.

(a) Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
consummate the Restructuring prior to the Closing. Sellers shall provide Buyer
drafts of all Restructuring Documentation at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. All such Restructuring Documentation shall be
subject to Buyer's review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Nothing in this Section 6.12 shall affect the Buyer Indemnified
Persons' indemnification rights under Article 7.

(b) After the Closing, upon Buyer's written request, Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Excluded Subsidiaries to, assign, transfer and convey to an Acquired
Company any asset, Intellectual Property, Contract, or other right not
specifically listed on Schedule 1.1(c) that was owned by any Excluded
Subsidiary, or to which any Excluded Subsidiary was a party to, as of the
Closing Date.

Section 6.13. Employee Matters.

(a) As of the Closing Date, and for a period of at least twelve (12) months
thereafter, Buyer will provide, or cause one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including the Company) to provide, each Employee with (i) a base salary or an
hourly wage rate that is not less than that provided to such Employee by the
Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) bonus and incentive
compensation opportunities that are not less favorable than those provided to
such Employee by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Closing, and
(iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
Buyer's similarly situated employees. Buyer and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates will recognize, for purposes of any personal time off taken in the
first sixty (60) days of employment with Buyer and for eligibility and vesting
purposes under the Buyer 401(k) Plan, all prior service of the Employees with
the Acquired Companies as service with Buyer and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates; provided, that no such service credit will be recognized to the
extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of
clarity, nothing in this Section 6.13 shall restrict Buyer's ability to
terminate Employees at any time after the Closing.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall designate, or shall
cause one of Buyer's other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to designate, a defined
contribution plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement and that
satisfies the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the
"Buyer 401(k) Plan") in which the Employees will be allowed to participate.
Each Employee who was eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the termination of such plan shall become eligible to
participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the
Company 401(k) Plan on behalf of Employees that elect such eligible rollover
distributions into the Buyer 401(k) Plan and who remain employed by Buyer, any
Acquired Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates at the
time of such rollover.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.13 (i) is intended to, or will be construed to,
confer upon any Employee or any other Person other than the Parties any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to continued employment; or (ii)
will establish, amend or be deemed to establish or amend any Benefit Plan or
any other benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Buyer or any
Acquired Company or will limit the rights of Buyer or any Acquired Company to
establish, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement, whether before or after the Closing.

(d) Each Continuing Employee shall be subject to a background check and drug
screening as a condition of continued employment. Sellers shall cause the
Company to use commercially reasonable efforts during the Pre-Closing Period
to assist Buyer with collecting documentation and other reasonable assistance
with respect to Buyer's efforts to conduct criminal background checks and drug
screenings on each Continuing Employee.

Section 6.14. Company 401(k) Plan Termination. Sellers shall cause the Company
to take all actions as are necessary to be taken prior to the Closing to cause
the Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective no later than the day
immediately prior to the Closing, including causing the Company to fund any
contributions, including employer matching contributions due to the 401(k)
Plan and ensuring all forfeitures will be allocated or used prior to the
termination. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Buyer or its legal counsel with a copy of the
resolutions authorizing the Company 401(k) Plan termination for review and
approval prior to their adoption, with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.15. Certain Domains. After the Closing and for the period (each, a
"Redirect Period") set forth opposite the applicable domain name on Schedule
6.15, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, redirect traffic from the domain names listed on Schedule 6.15 to one website owned by
Sellers or an Excluded Subsidiary (such website to be specified by the
Sellers' Representative). At all times during the Redirect Period for the
applicable domain, Sellers shall cause the following disclaimer to be
prominently displayed on the website to which such traffic is redirected:

displayed on this website."

Losses exceeds $525,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only in respect of such
excess; provided, that this Section 7.4(a) shall not apply to any Special
Matter or to any claim based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but
not negligent misrepresentation). (b) Buyer shall have no Liability pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with respect to
Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds the
Deductible, and then only in respect of such excess; provided, that this
Section 7.4(b) shall not apply to any Special Matter or to any claim based on

account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Article 2.

(h) Sellers shall not be liable for (i) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies
attributable to or resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election (including
by way of example only, any Taxes under Section 1374 of the Code, Transfer

not being treated as a subchapter S corporation or qualified subchapter S

agreement in this Agreement by any Seller or the Sellers' Representative that
results in the Company or ValuePenguin OpCo not being treated as a subchapter
S corporation or qualified subchapter S subsidiary, or (iii) any Taxes of the
Acquired Companies incurred on the Closing Date after the Closing that are
outside the Ordinary Course.

Section 7.5. Other Limitations.

(a) For all purposes of this Article 7, Losses incurred or suffered by an
Indemnified Person shall be net of any amounts of any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Person (other than with respect to any
self-insurance program of the Indemnified Person) or any indemnification or
contribution payments under any Contract that are actually received by the
Indemnified Person in connection with such Losses, after taking into account
any deductible, costs and expenses incurred in collecting such insurance
proceeds or other payments or any increase in insurance premiums as a result
of such claim.

(b) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any indemnification payment
required hereunder is determined after payment by an Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Person of any amount otherwise required to be paid as
indemnification pursuant hereto, the Indemnified Person shall repay, promptly
after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Person would not
have had to pay pursuant hereto had such determination been made at the time
of such payment.

(c) Notwithstanding the fact that any Indemnified Person may have the right to
assert claims for indemnification under or in respect of more than one
provision of this Agreement in respect of any fact, event, condition or
circumstance, no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover the amount of
any Loss suffered by such Indemnified Person more than once, regardless of
whether such Loss may be as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, obligation or covenant or otherwise. In addition,
any Liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such Liability, or a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as applicable.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining under this Article 7 the amount of any Losses resulting from
the breach of any representation or warranty (but not as the existence of such
breach), any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification with respect to materiality contained in or otherwise applicable
to such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to
reimbursement for Losses in connection with the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.

(f) For the purpose of this Article 7, in each case where a decision or
agreement to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person is,
collectively, to be made by Sellers, then in each such case all references to
such Indemnified Person or Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, in this
Article 7 (except for provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right
to receive any payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers'
Representative acting on behalf of such Indemnified Person or Indemnifying
Person, as applicable.

Section 7.6. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Person may have Liability to any Indemnified Person hereunder, is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Person by a third party
(a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Person shall promptly, but in no
event more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified Person's receipt of a
Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Person in writing of such Third-
Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder
to the extent then ascertainable, any other remedy sought thereunder, any
relevant time constraints relating thereto of which the Indemnified Person is
then aware, and a reasonably detailed explanation of the events giving rise to
such Third-Party Claim and any other material details pertaining thereto of
which the Indemnified Person is then aware (a "Claim Notice"); provided, that
the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Person shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure or as provided in Section 7.1. Thereafter, the Indemnified Person
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person, promptly following the Indemnified
Person's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Person of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to
defend the Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable
hereunder by appropriate proceedings and with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Person and shall have the power to direct and control such
defense at its expense, subject, solely in the case of a Third Party Claim
received after the Indemnity Escrow Account has been released or exhausted in
full, to the Indemnifying Person's (i) acknowledging its indemnity obligation
hereunder and undertaking to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Person
harmless from, against and in respect of, and to pay to such Indemnified
Person the full amount of any Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting
therefrom (subject to any applicable limitations on such obligations set forth
in this Agreement), and (ii) providing the Indemnified Person with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person that the Indemnifying Person
will have the financial resources to defend against such Third-Party Claim and
to fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Person shall not have the right to assume the
conduct and control of such defense if the Third-Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Person seeks to assume control: (A) seeks monetary relief in
excess of the purchase price actually paid hereunder; (B) seeks any non-
monetary relief (including an injunction or other equitable relief) as the
primary remedy against an Acquired Company or as any remedy that, if adversely
decided, would apply to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (but excluding any
Acquired Company); (C) involves criminal allegations; (D) involves a claim
that, in the good faith and reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Person, the
Indemnifying Person failed or is failing to reasonably prosecute or defend;
(E) if the Indemnifying Person is a Seller, is asserted by or on behalf of a
Person that is a significant supplier or significant customer of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (but excluding any Acquired Company); (F) relates to Taxes or (G)
involves a claim by a Governmental Authority. Once the Indemnifying Person has
made such election, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate
in (but not control) any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing at such Indemnified Person's expense (unless based on the advice of
counsel to the applicable Indemnified Person, a material legal conflict exists
between the applicable Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person that
would make such separate representation necessary, in which case the
Indemnifying Person will bear such expense, subject to the limitations set
forth herein). If the Indemnifying Person does not (or is not permitted to)
elect to conduct or control the defense of any Third-Party Claim which relates
to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder, the applicable Indemnified Person may
conduct and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided, that the
Indemnified Person shall not settle, offer to settle or compromise such Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood
that withholding, delaying and/or conditioning consent to any settlement or
compromise that involves anything other than payment of monetary damages shall
be deemed to be reasonable per se) of the Indemnified Person, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim; provided,
that, if the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim
and is in good faith contesting such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Person's consent is not required for any settlement, compromise or discharge
of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Person may reasonably recommend
and that by its terms (i) obligates the Indemnifying Person to pay the full
amount of Losses in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not
require any payment or other action by any Indemnified Person or the admission
of any wrongdoing or misconduct by any Indemnified Person and (iii) fully and
irrevocably releases all Indemnified Persons in connection with such Third-
Party Claim and does not impose any injunctive or other equitable relief
against any Indemnified Person or its Affiliate.

(d) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim, including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant books
and records, and appropriate personnel. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Person's request and sole expense) the
provision to the Indemnifying Person of books and records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and appropriate personnel
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law), to cooperate with the other Party to
minimize the extent of such disclosure and to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to
be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges (which may include redacting or withholding information as
reasonably appropriate).

Section 7.7. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Person
shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnifying Person written
notice thereof no later than thirty (30) days following the Indemnified
Person's discovery of the applicable Losses reasonably likely to give rise to
a claim under this Article 7; provided, that the failure to timely give notice
of such Direct Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure or as provided in
Section 7.1. Such notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, include copies of all available material written
evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Person.

Section 7.8. Investigation by Indemnifying Persons. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this Article 7, Buyer (if the Indemnified Person is a Buyer
Indemnified Person) or each Seller (if the Indemnified Person is a Seller
Indemnified Person) shall, and shall cause its or his Affiliates and
Representatives to:

(a) provide the Indemnifying Person and its financial, accounting or legal
advisors such information as the Indemnifying Person shall reasonably request
in connection with investigating the facts, matters or circumstances alleged to (or which may) give rise to such claim and to what
extent any amount is or may be payable in respect of such claim;

(b) upon reasonable advance written notice, provide the Indemnifying Person
and its financial, accounting or legal advisors reasonable access during
normal business hours to premises and personnel (including any relevant
employee who at the time is employed by the Indemnified Person) with knowledge
regarding the relevant facts, matters or circumstances; and

(c) allow the Indemnifying Person and its financial, accounting or legal
advisers to examine and copy or photograph any assets, accounts,
correspondence, documents and records reasonably relating to the relevant
facts, matters or circumstances;

in each case, subject to customary confidentiality and expense reimbursement
undertakings by the Indemnifying Person and its financial, accounting and
legal advisors

Section 7.9. Indemnification Payment Priority. Except with respect to claims
for fraud or intentional misrepresentation (but not negligent
misrepresentation), for any Loss for which any Seller is obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons, the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
seek reimbursement for such Loss: (a) first, from the Escrow Account, and once
the Escrow Account is exhausted, and (b) second, on a several (and not joint)
basis from Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. For
clarity, the Escrow Account is available to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
all indemnification claims and Losses under this Article 7.

Section 7.10. Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made
by any Indemnifying Person to an Indemnified Person with respect to any claim
pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 shall be treated, to the fullest extent
possible under applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

Section 7.11. Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, except as provided in Section 2.9 (Post-Closing Determination), for
the right of any Party to seek specific performance, any right or remedy
specifically set forth in a Transaction Document (besides this Agreement or
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or with respect to fraud
or intentional misrepresentation (but not negligent misrepresentation), from
and after the Closing the rights and remedies of any Indemnified Person, under
this Article 7 are the sole and exclusive remedy and in lieu of any and all
other rights and remedies which any Indemnified Person, may have under this
Agreement or otherwise against each other with respect to any Transaction
Document and with respect to the transactions contemplated thereby, and each
Party expressly waives and releases and agrees to waive and release (in each
case on behalf of all respective Indemnified Persons) any and all other rights
or causes of action it or any respective Indemnified Person may have against
any Indemnifying Person now or in the future under any Law (regardless of the
theory of recourse) with respect to the preceding matters.

Section 7.12. Release of Indemnity Escrow Amount. Within three (3) Business
Days following the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay,
or cause to be paid, to Sellers based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, any
then-remaining funds in the Escrow Account minus any amounts accounting for
any outstanding claims against the Escrow Account that have been properly made
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.13. Non-Recourse. Except as expressly set forth in this Article 7,
no Party shall have recourse whatsoever under this Agreement against any of
the officers, directors, managers and/or employees of the other Parties
(including for such purposes, the officers, directors and/or employees of any
Affiliate of a Party, but expressly excluding Sellers) with respect to the
negotiation and documentation of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Article 7,
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and Sellers, on behalf of
themselves and their Affiliates, each hereby fully and irrevocably waives any
right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against such officers, directors,
managers and/or employees relating to any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any of them arising from, based upon, related to, or associated with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement whether based on contract, tort,
strict liability other laws or otherwise and whether by piercing of the corporate veil, by claim on behalf of or by a Party or other Person or
otherwise. For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Section 7.13 shall reduce
or abridge the liability of Sellers under this Article 7 or otherwise.

Section 10.3. Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents (including all
Schedules and Exhibits thereto) contain the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter thereof, and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.

Section 10.4. Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Sellers' Representative,
or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom such waiver is intended
to be effective. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 10.5. No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer
(in the case of an assignment by any Seller or, prior to the Closing, the
Company) or the Sellers' Representative (in the case of any assignment by
Buyer or, after the Closing, the Company), and any purported assignment in
violation of the foregoing shall be null and void ab initio, except that Buyer
may assign this Agreement and any or all rights hereunder to one or more
Affiliates of Buyer without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative, but any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in Section 6.7 or Article
7, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any Person other than Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Sellers, and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any
rights, benefits or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.6. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all fees and expenses
relating to the Escrow Agent shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Sellers. Section 10.7. Disclosure Schedule.

(a) The "Disclosure Schedule" means the document identified as the Disclosure
Schedule, dated as of the date of this Agreement, delivered by Sellers to
Buyer in connection with this Agreement. Each Section in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to which the application of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. It is specifically
acknowledged that the Disclosure Schedule may expressly provide exceptions to
a particular Section of Articles 3 or 4 notwithstanding that the Section does
not include a schedule reference.

(b) Neither the specification of any Dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of Material Adverse
Effect or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this
Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any
item or matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not
in the Ordinary Course, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth
or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary
Course for purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Each Section of the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and does not constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of any Party, except as and to the extent provided in this
Agreement. Certain matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule are included
for informational purposes only notwithstanding that, because they do not rise
above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they may not be required
by the terms of this Agreement to be set forth herein.

Section 10.8. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of its conflict of laws
principles, including as to matters of validity, construction, effect,
performance and remedies.

(b) Each of the Parties: (i) submits to the jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting or having jurisdiction in Dover County, Delaware in any
Action (except where such Action is required to be submitted to a specific
Governmental Authority, as required by Law) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any Action shall be heard
and determined in any such court and (iii) agrees not to bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each Party
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other Party with respect thereto. Any Party may make service on another
Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served
at the address and in the manner provided for giving of notices in Section
10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.8 will affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

Section 10.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which, including those received via facsimile transmission or email
(including in PDF format), shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Section 10.10. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable: (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.11. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence for each and every
provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.12. Injunctive Relief. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such Party, and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction (without
the requirement of posting a bond).

Section 10.13. No Rescission. No Party shall be entitled to rescind the
transactions contemplated hereby by virtue of any failure of any Party's
representations and warranties herein to have been true or any failure by any
Party to perform its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.14. Certain Waivers.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that:

(i) Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, LLP (or any successor) (the "Seller Group
Law Firm") has acted as counsel to Sellers and the Sellers' Representative
(individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), and the Company in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer
agrees, and shall cause the Company to agree, that, following consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, such representation and any prior
representation of the Company by Seller Group Law Firm shall not preclude
Seller Group Law Firm from serving as counsel to any member of the Seller
Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, seek or have Seller
Group Law Firm disqualified from any such representation based upon the prior
representation of the Company by Seller Group Law Firm. Each of the Parties
hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising from such
prior representation, and each of the Parties shall cause any of its
Affiliates to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation. Each of the Parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver
is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the Parties have
consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection
herewith. The covenants, consent and waiver contained in this Section 10.14
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Seller Group Law
Firm are entitled whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

(b) All communications between the Seller Group or the Company, on the one
hand, and Seller Group Law Firm, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Privileged
Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the
Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company.
Accordingly, Buyer and the Company shall not have access to any Privileged
Communications or to the files of Seller Group Law Firm relating to such
engagement from and after Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) the Seller Group (and not Buyer or
the Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of Buyer or the Company shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Seller Group Law Firm in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the Seller
Group (and not Buyer nor the Company) shall hold such property rights and
(iii) Seller Group Law Firm shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to Buyer or the
Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Seller Group Law
Firm and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company), on the
one hand, and a third party other than any of the Seller Group, on the other
hand, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
to such third party; provided, that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company) is legally required by Governmental
Order or otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by
applicable Law, and (y) advisable in the opinion of Buyer's counsel, then
Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers' Representative in writing so that the
Sellers' Representative can seek a protective order.

[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first written above.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated [________], 2019, is entered
into by and among LendingTree, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Buyer"), Jonathan Wu, as the Sellers' Representative (the "Sellers'
Representative"), and Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio banking corporation (the
"Escrow Agent").

RECITALS

A. Buyer, the Sellers' Representative, Value Holding Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), and the Sellers of the Company named therein
("Sellers") have entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated December 20,
2018 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Buyer will acquire from
Sellers all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. For purposes
of this Agreement, all capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Purchase Agreement unless otherwise defined herein or the
context otherwise requires.

B. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the parties to the Purchase Agreement
have agreed that Buyer will deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent,
to be held and applied by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

C. Buyer and the Sellers' Representative desire to appoint the Escrow Agent as
the escrow agent pursuant to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent is willing
to act as escrow agent hereunder.

AGREEMENT

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

PURPOSE OF ESCROW AMOUNT



1.1To the extent and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement, (a) the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy, in part
or in whole, the Final Net Adjustment Amount, to the extent the absolute value
of such amount is payable to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.10(b) of the Purchase
Agreement and (b) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy certain
claims by Buyer Indemnified Persons in accordance with Article 7 of the
Purchase Agreement.



ARTICLE II

APPOINTMENTS



2.1The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative hereby appoint the Escrow Agent
to act as escrow agent hereunder, and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to serve
as escrow agent upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.



ARTICLE III

ESCROW



3.1Escrow. At Closing, Buyer shall deposit (a) in a separate account (the
"Adjustment Escrow Account") Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000)
(together with all interest and other income earned thereon, if any, less
amounts previously disbursed therefrom pursuant to the terms hereof as of any
given point in time, the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") and (b) in a separate
account (the "Indemnity Escrow Account" and, together with the Adjustment
Escrow Account, the "Escrow Account") Thirteen Million One Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($13,125,000) (together with all interest and other income
earned thereon, if any, less amounts previously disbursed therefrom pursuant
to the terms hereof as of any given point in time, the "Indemnity Escrow
Amount"), with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to accept, in
its capacity as such, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount (such amounts as increased by any earnings, interest and gains on and
proceeds from the investment or reinvestment thereof are hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Escrow Amount"), which shall be held in the applicable
Escrow Account and distributed in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.



3.2Representative Certificates. Buyer shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a Representative Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A (a
"Representative Certificate"), and such other documents or instruments as
reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent for the purpose of establishing the
identity of the representatives of Buyer entitled to issue instructions or
directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer. In the event of any change
in the identity of such representatives of Buyer, a new Representative
Certificate shall be executed and delivered to the Escrow Agent by Buyer by
one of the then-remaining representatives of Buyer. Until such time as the
Escrow Agent shall receive a new Representative Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall be fully protected in relying without inquiry on the current
Representative Certificate most recently provided by Buyer to the Escrow
Agent. In the event instructions are given (other than in writing at the time
of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or
otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call back to the person or persons designated in the
most current Representative Certificate provided by Buyer to the Escrow Agent,
and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
the person or persons so designated, absent fraud, gross negligence, or
willful misconduct. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions,
or is not satisfied with the verification it receives, the Escrow Agent shall
not be required to execute the instruction until all issues have been
resolved. Buyer and the Sellers' Representative agree to notify the Escrow
Agent of any errors, delays or other problems within five (5) calendar days
after receiving notification that a transaction has been executed.



3.3Investment of Escrow Amount. The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be invested
without distinction between principal or interest by the Escrow Agent in the
following Fifth Third BankSafe Deposit Account: [00-0-0000000] Note to draft:
Escrow Agent to provide prior to Closing.. The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall
be invested without distinction between principal or interest by the Escrow
Agent in the following Fifth Third BankSafe Deposit Account: [00-0-0000000]
Note to draft: Escrow Agent to provide prior to Closing.. Investments of
monies in the Escrow Account shall in any event mature or be redeemable or be
subject to liquidation by sale or otherwise at the option of the Escrow Agent
at such time as may be necessary to make timely disbursements from the Escrow
Account. Any such investments may be purchased from the Escrow Agent or any
affiliate of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Account shall be credited with all
proceeds of sale and income from such investment. Without the advance written
consent of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, no funds of the Escrow
Account may be invested in any securities other than those identified above.
Buyer and Sellers' Representative acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not
providing investment supervision, recommendations, or advice. Any loss or
expense incurred as a result of an investment made in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereof will be borne by the Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the interest and other income
earned with respect to the Escrow Accounts pursuant to this Agreement exceed
in the aggregate 15% of the aggregate amount of the initial deposit of the
Escrow Account, and any amounts of the interest and other income received with
respect to the Escrow Accounts in excess thereof will be paid to Buyer. The
preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the right to the Escrow Account
is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.



3.4Release of the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Within five (5) Business Days
after the calculation of the Final Net Adjustment Amount under Section 2.9 of
the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall deliver to
Escrow Agent a Joint Written Notice instructing Escrow Agent to distribute the
Adjustment Escrow Amount held in the Adjustment Escrow Account as set forth in
such Joint Written Notice. Within two (2) Business Days after the date on
which Escrow Agent receives such executed Joint Written Notice, Escrow Agent
shall disburse the portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount set forth in the
Joint Written Notice to the person(s) or account(s) designated on such Joint
Written Notice. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Joint Written Notice" shall
mean a written notice in the form attached as Exhibit B executed by Buyer and
the Sellers' Representative specifying the amount of the distribution and the
address to which such distribution check should be mailed (or the wire
instructions for the recipient of such distribution, as applicable).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Buyer and Sellers' Representative
agree that any Joint Written Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Section 3.4 shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, simulatenously
with the disbursement(s) with respect to the Final Net Adjustment, an amount equal to 30% of the income earned on the Adjustment
Escrow Amount during the calendar quarter in which a disbursement is made
pursuant to this Section 3.4.



3.5Term of Indemnity Escrow Account. Unless released earlier pursuant to
Section 3.5 or a Joint Written Notice, the Indemnity Escrow Amount will be
held by the Escrow Agent until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date (the "Indemnity Escrow Termination Date"). Within three (3)
Business Days after the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative shall submit a Joint Written Notice instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay, within two (2) Business Days following the receipt of
such Joint Written Notice, (i) the Undisputed Amount (as defined below) to the
Sellers' Representative (for further distribution to the Sellers) and (ii) an
amount equal to 30% of the income earned on the Indemnity Escrow Amount during
the calendar quarter in which a disbursement is made pursuant to this Section
3.5 (a "Tax Distribution"); provided, however, that if Buyer does not execute
and deliver such Joint Written Notice within such three (3) Business Day
period by 5:00 PM Eastern time, the Escrow Agent shall, without any further
action by Buyer, the Sellers' Representative or any other Person pay the
foregoing amount to the Selles' Representative by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account set forth on Exhibit C. Neither Buyer nor the
Escrow Agent shall have any liability with respect to the allocation of funds
to be released by the Sellers' Representative to Sellers. The Escrow Agent
shall retain in the Indemnity Escrow Account the amounts reserved for Pending
Claims (as defined below) and all related fees, costs and expenses until such
time as the Escrow Agent is permitted to disburse such funds pursuant to
Section 3.8. As used herein, the "Undisputed Amount" means an aggregate
amount, if any, equal to (x) the then-current balance of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount minus (y) a Tax Distribution as specified in the relevant Joint Written
Notice delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant this Section 3.5 (which Tax
Distribution will be paid to Buyer as directed by such Joint Written Notice)
minus (z) the aggregate of all disputed amounts cited in an Objection Notice
then remaining unresolved and the Claim Amount for pending indemnification
claim(s) asserted by any Buyer Indemnified Person prior to the Indemnity
Escrow Termination Date under Section 3.6 (a "Pending Claim").



3.6Claims for Payment from Indemnity Escrow Account by Buyer.



(a)If at any time on or prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date Buyer
(i) believes that a Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to payment or that
payment should be made to a third party pursuant to the terms of Article 7 of
the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) desires to make a claim for payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Account in connection therewith, then Buyer shall give
written notice of such claim (a "Payment Notice") to the Sellers'
Representative and the Escrow Agent stating Buyer's good faith estimate of the
amount of such claim (the "Claim Amount"). If the Sellers' Representative
objects to payment of the Claim Amount, the Sellers' Representative shall give
written notice of such objection (an "Objection Notice") to Buyer and the
Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by the Escrow
Agent of the Payment Notice (the "Objection Period"), and shall state in the
Objection Notice the basis for such objection in reasonable detail. If no
Objection Notice to Buyer's claim is delivered by the Sellers' Representative
prior to the end of the Objection Period, the claim set forth in the Payment
Notice shall be deemed approved and accepted by the Sellers' Representative
for all purposes under this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and shall be
paid to or as directed by Buyer by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Payment Notice no later than three (3) Business Days following the end of the
Objection Period. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to verify that the
Payment Notice was received by the Sellers' Representative or to verify the
content of the Payment Notice and shall be permitted to treat any written
notice from Buyer claiming to constitute a Payment Notice as a Payment Notice
in accordance with this Agreement.



(b)If the Sellers' Representative provides an Objection Notice to Buyer and
the Escrow Agent in respect of any Payment Notice prior to the expiration of
the Objection Period in accordance with Section 3.6(a), then the Escrow Agent
shall not distribute to Buyer any portion of the Claim Amount until the Escrow
Agent receives either a Joint Written Notice or a Final Order with respect to
such claim; provided, that if the Sellers' Representative objects only in part
to the Claim Amount, the Escrow Agent shall, within three (3) Business Days
following delivery of the Objection Notice, pay to or as directed by Buyer an
amount equal to the undisputed portion of the Claim Amount. "Final Order"
means a judgment, order or decree of an arbitrator, court or other judicial
body that decided the disbursement of the amounts reserved for such disputed
claim, together with a certificate of the presenting party to the effect that
such judgment is final, non-appealable and from a court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator having proper authority, upon which certificate the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely without further
investigation. For purposes of the foregoing definition, "final, non-appealable" means that
such order, judgment or decree has not been reversed, stayed, modified or
amended and, as to which (1) the time to appeal, petition for certiorari, or
move for reconsideration, reargument or rehearing has expired and no timely
appeal, petition for certiorari, or motion for reconsideration, reargument or
rehearing is pending, (2) any right to appeal, petition for certiorari, or
move for reconsideration, reargument or rehearing has been waived in writing,
or (3) if an appeal, petition for certiorari, or motion for reconsideration,
reargument or rehearing thereof has been denied, the time to take any further
appeal or to further petition for certiorari or move for further
reconsideration, reargument or rehearing has expired. At any time the Escrow
Agent may in good faith file an interpleader action in any court of competent
jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and other costs incurred in
commencing and maintaining any such interpleader action.



3.7Limit on Allowed Claims. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be required to
pay an amount in excess of the then current balance of the Escrow Account.



3.8Disbursement of Balance of Indemnity Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent shall
hold and/or distribute the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the
following:



(a)Following the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount associated with a Pending Claim which is resolved in
favor of any Buyer Indemnified Persons, shall be paid to or as directed by
Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days following receipt by the Escrow
Agent of a Final Order or a Joint Written Notice directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to Buyer in respect of
each such resolved Pending Claim pursuant to this Section 3.8(a).



(b)Following the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount associated with a Pending Claim which is resolved in
favor of Sellers shall be paid (less a Tax Distribution for such calendar
quarter, which shall be paid to Buyer as directed by any Joint Written Notice
delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 3.8(b)), no later than
three (3) Business Days following receipt by the Escrow Agent of a Final Order
or a Joint Written Notice directing the Escrow Agent to distribute such
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount in respect of each such resolved
Pending Claim, to the Sellers' Representative (for further distribution to
Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) pursuant to this
Section 3.8(b); provided, however, that in no event shall any amount be paid
to the Sellers' Representative to the extent that doing so would leave the
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount less than the then Pending Claims.
Neither Buyer nor the Escrow Agent shall have any liability with respect to
the allocation of funds to be released by the Sellers' Representative to
Sellers.



3.9Escrow Agent.



(a)The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be purely ministerial in
nature. Under no circumstances will the Escrow Agent be deemed to be a
fiduciary to Buyer or the Sellers' Representative or any other person under
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be obligated to act only as
specifically set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to comply with any orders, judgments or decrees of any arbitrator
and of any court and shall not be liable as a result of its compliance with
the same.



(b)As to any legal questions arising in connection with the administration of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely absolutely upon the opinions given
to it by its counsel and shall be free of liability for acting in good faith
in reliance on such opinions.



(c)Absent fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part
of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may rely absolutely upon the genuineness
and authorization of the signature and purported signature of any party upon
any instruction, notice, release, receipt or other document delivered to it
pursuant to this Agreement.



(d)The Escrow Agent may, as a condition to the disbursement of monies as
provided herein, require from the payee or recipient a receipt therefor.

 (e)The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
contemplated by this Agreement in the event it becomes aware of any dispute
between the Sellers' Representative and Buyer as to any material facts or as
to the happening of any event.



(f)All fees of the Escrow Agent for the services provided by the Escrow Agent
under this Agreement are set forth on Exhibit D hereto. All such fees shall be
paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of
Sellers).



(g)In the event of any disagreement among the parties hereto resulting in
adverse claims or demands being made in connection with any portion of the
Escrow Amount as a result of which the Escrow Agent is, in good faith, in
reasonable doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Amount until the Escrow Agent shall
have received (i) a Final Order directing delivery of the Escrow Amount, or
(ii) a Joint Written Notice, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse such
portion of the Escrow Amount in accordance with such Final Order or Joint
Written Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time the Escrow Agent
may file an interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability
as to the Escrow Amount and shall be entitled to recover attorneys' fees,
expenses and other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such
interpleader action.



3.10Terms of Purchase Agreement; Indemnity of Escrow Agent. The obligations
and duties of the Escrow Agent are confined to those specifically set forth in
this Agreement, notwithstanding references herein to other documents or
agreements. In the event that any of the terms and provisions of any other
agreement between any of the parties hereto conflict or are inconsistent with
any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall govern and control the duties of the Escrow Agent in all
respects (solely as it relates to the Escrow Agent). In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, solely as between Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, the terms
of the Purchase Agreement shall govern. The Escrow Agent shall not be subject
to, nor be under any obligation to ascertain or construe the terms and
conditions of any other instrument, or to interpret this Agreement in light of
any other agreement whether or not now or hereafter deposited with or
delivered to the Escrow Agent or referred to in this Agreement, nor shall the
Escrow Agent be obligated to inquire as to the form, execution, sufficiency,
or validity of any such instrument nor to inquire as to the identity,
authority, or rights of the person or persons executing or delivering same.
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any and all costs, damages, expenses
or claims, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which Escrow Agent may incur
or sustain as a result of or arising out of this Agreement or Escrow Agent's
exercise of any rights or performance of any duties hereunder, except to the
extent such costs, damages, expenses or claims are finally adjudicated to have
resulted from the Escrow Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct (provided, that, as between themselves, each of Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall bear fifty percent (50%)
of such obligation); however, to the extent any such costs, damages, expenses
or claims result from or are attributable to a party's failure to provide a
fully executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9 and/or such other forms and documents that
the Escrow Agent may reasonably request pursuant to Section 4.13(c), such
party shall be solely responsible for indemnifying the Escrow Agent for such
costs, damages, expenses or claims).



3.11Exculpation; Limitation of Liability. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable, directly or indirectly, for any (i) damages, losses or expenses
arising out of the services provided hereunder, other than damages, losses or
expenses which have been finally adjudicated to have directly resulted from
the Escrow Agent's breach of this Agreement, gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct, or (ii) special, indirect or consequential damages or
losses of any kind whatsoever (including without limitation lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the possibility of such losses or
damages and regardless of the form of action. The Escrow Agent shall not incur
any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any obligation
hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its control (including, but not
limited to, any provision of any present or future law or regulation or any
act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or terrorism, or the
unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire services or any electronic
communication facility).



3.12Acknowledgment by the Escrow Agent. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent acknowledges that the terms and provisions of this
Agreement are acceptable and it agrees to carry out the provisions of Article
III on its part. 

3.13Resignation or Removal of Escrow Agent; Successors.



(a)The Escrow Agent may resign as such following the giving of thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to Buyer and the Sellers' Representative.
Similarly, the Escrow Agent may be removed and replaced following mutual
agreement of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative and the giving of thirty
(30) days' prior written notice to the Escrow Agent by Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative. In either event, the duties of the Escrow Agent shall
terminate thirty (30) days after the date of such notice (or as of such
earlier date as may be mutually agreeable between the Escrow Agent, on the one
hand, and Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, on the other hand); and the
Escrow Agent shall then deliver the balance of the Escrow Account then in its
possession to a successor Escrow Agent as shall be appointed by Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative as evidenced by a Joint Written Notice delivered to
the Escrow Agent.



(b)If for any reason any successor bank or escrow company is unwilling to
serve as successor Escrow Agent or if Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
are unable to agree upon a successor or shall have failed to appoint a
successor prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following the date of
the notice of resignation or removal, the then acting Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or other appropriate relief; and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto.



(c)Every successor escrow agent appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to its predecessor and also to Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative, an instrument in writing accepting such appointment hereunder,
and thereupon such successor escrow agent, without any further act, shall
become fully vested with all the duties, responsibilities and obligations of
its predecessor and shall be deemed the Escrow Agent for all purposes under
this Agreement; but such predecessor shall, nevertheless, on the written
request of the successor escrow agent, Buyer or the Sellers' Representative,
execute and deliver an instrument or instruments transferring to such
successor escrow agent all the rights of such predecessor hereunder, and shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver all funds and property held by it pursuant
to this Agreement to the successor escrow agent. Should any instrument be
required by any successor escrow agent to more fully vest in such successor
escrow agent the duties, responsibilities and obligations hereby vested or
intended to be vested in the predecessor, any and all such instruments in
writing shall, on the request of Buyer or the Sellers' Representative, be
executed, acknowledged and delivered by the predecessor.



(d)Upon acknowledgment by any successor escrow agent of the receipt of the
then remaining balance of the Escrow Account, the then acting escrow agent
shall be fully released and relieved of all duties, responsibilities and
obligations under this Agreement.



3.14Insolvency Matters.



(a)Subject to Section 4.13, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf
of all Sellers) agree, as between Buyer and Sellers, that to the extent
permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, Sellers shall be
treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount for accounting purposes, such that
the Escrow Amount is shown as an asset of Sellers on financial statements and
other accounting-related records of Sellers, and the Escrow Amount is not
shown as an asset of Buyer on similar records of Buyer.



(b)Buyer and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of all Sellers) agree, as
between Buyer and each of Sellers, that in the event any of them becomes party
or subject to a bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding,
the creditors of such party shall have no right to any portion of the Escrow
Amount unless and until such party obtains the right to have such portion of
the Escrow Amount released to such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (and in such case, the rights of any such creditor(s) in such
portion of the Escrow Amount shall be no greater than the rights such party
would have had in such portion in the absence of such bankruptcy,
receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding).

 ARTICLE IV

MISCELLANEOUS



4.1Assignment; Successors and Assigns; Third Parties. Except as otherwise
provided herein, no party to this Agreement shall convey, assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
express written consent of all other parties; provided, however, that Buyer
may, upon the delivery to the Escrow Agent of (i) written evidence of such
assignment in form and substance satisfactory to the Escrow Agent, and (ii)
all documentation, information, or certificates as the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request hereunder, or as may be necessary from time to time in
order for the Escrow Agent to comply with Section 4.13 or Section 4.15 hereof,
or, any "Know Your Customer" or similar law, rule, regulation or policy to
which the Escrow Agent is or may become subject to, without the consent of the
Sellers' Representative, assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to its lenders as collateral security or
to any person or entity that acquires (whether by merger, purchase of stock,
purchase of assets or otherwise) Buyer, or is the successor or surviving
entity in any such acquisition, merger or other transaction involving, Buyer
(provided that if Buyer so assigns its obligations, Buyer shall not be
relieved of its obligations hereunder in the event that any such assignee
fails to perform such obligations so assigned). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any banking association or corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be
merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any banking association or corporation
to which all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall succeed to all the Escrow Agent's
rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that as
promptly as possible following completion of such transaction involving the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver written notice thereof to Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is not intended to benefit,
and shall not run to the benefit of or be enforceable by, any other person or
entity other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns.



4.2Entire Agreement. This Agreement and, solely with respect to Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative, the Purchase Agreement set forth the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, negotiations, inducements or conditions, express or implied,
oral or written, with respect thereto. In the event of any direct conflict of
the terms of this Agreement with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, as with
respect to the rights of the Sellers' Representative and Buyer, the terms of
the Purchase Agreement shall control and prevail; provided, that in no event
shall the Escrow Agent be bound by the terms of the Purchase Agreement.



4.3Amendment and Waiver; Cumulative Effect.



(a)To be effective, any amendment or waiver of or under this Agreement must be
in writing and signed by Buyer, the Sellers' Representative and the Escrow
Agent.



(b)Neither the failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or
remedy provided in this Agreement or to insist upon compliance by any other
party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the
parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such right, power or remedy or to demand
such compliance; provided, that this Section ý4.3 shall not extend any time
period provided for herein.



4.4Severability. If a provision of this Agreement is deemed to be contrary to
law, that provision will be deemed separable from the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and will not affect the validity, interpretation or effect of
the other provisions of either this Agreement or any agreement executed
pursuant to it or the application of that provision to other circumstances not
contrary to law.



4.5Notices. All notices, consents, waivers, agreements or other communications
hereunder shall be deemed effective or to have been duly given and made (and
shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) only if in
writing and if (a) served by personal delivery upon the party for whom it is
intended, (b) delivered by overnight air courier or (c) sent by facsimile transmission or email, with

OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE

in the performance of its duties hereunder, and shall afford Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative reasonable access, during regular business hours, to
review and make photocopies (at such party's cost) of the same.



4.12Brokerage Confirmation Waiver. Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
hereby: (a) acknowledge that regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency grant them the right to receive brokerage confirmations of

receive periodic cash transaction statements, which will detail all investment
transactions.



4.13Tax Matters.



(a)The parties agree that (i) the Escrow Amount shall be treated as owned by
the Buyer for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes until distributed
pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement and (ii)
upon any release of the Escrow Amount to the Sellers' Representative (for
further distribution to Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares), the portion of the released amount that constitutes interest under
the Code will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as a
payment of interest to Sellers, and Buyer will be permitted a corresponding
interest deduction in accordance with Section 483 of the Code or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1275-4(c) (it being understood that Buyer shall be
responsible for computations under such Treasury Regulation). The parties
agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other income earned
on the Escrow Amount in any tax year, which tax year in any tax year shall be
the period from January 1-December 31 (each period, a "Tax Year") shall be
reported as allocated to Buyer, except as otherwise required by applicable
law. Unless otherwise required by law, the parties agree to file all tax
returns on a basis consistent with the foregoing reporting. Unless otherwise
required by law, the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any
information reports (including without limitation IRS Forms 1099-B) other than
such information reports of interest earned on the Escrow Amount as the Escrow
Agent is required to prepare and file in the ordinary course of its business.
The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to report any amounts to the parties
resulting from the deposit of the Escrow Amount or the release of the Escrow
Amount as a result of or related to the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement.



(b)The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
distributed or released from the Escrow Amount all taxes which are required to
be deducted or withheld under any provision of applicable tax law; provided,
that if the Escrow Agent determines that any deduction or withholding is
required, it shall inform the applicable payee of its intention to deduct or
withhold as soon as reasonably practicable and it shall cooperate on a
reasonable basis with the applicable payee to eliminate or reduce any such
deduction or withholding. All such withheld amounts that are paid to the
proper taxing authority shall be treated as having been delivered to the party
entitled to the amount distributed or released in respect of which such tax
has been deducted or withheld.



(c)Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall each furnish the Escrow Agent
with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or Form W-9, properly completed and
signed, and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request.



(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the Buyer and
Sellers' Representative agree that, within ten (10) Business Days of the end
of each calendar quarter during which any amount remains in the Escrow
Accounts, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver Joint Written
Instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to
Buyer a Tax Distribution for such calendar quarter, less any Tax Distributions
paid to Buyer during such calendar quarter pursuant to Section 3.4, 3.5 or
3.8(b). 

4.14Further Assurances.



(a)Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of another party hereto, shall
execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts
and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely the
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b)No party to this Agreement is (or will be) a person with whom the Escrow
Agent is restricted from doing business under regulations of the Office of
Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") of the Department of the Treasury of the United
States of America (including, those persons named on OFAC's Specially
Designated and Blocked Persons list) or under any statute, executive order
(including, the September 24, 2001 Executive Order Blocking Property and
Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or
Support Terrorism), or other governmental action and is not and shall not
engage in any dealings or transactions or otherwise be associated with such
persons. The parties acknowledge that prior to the establishment of the Escrow
Account and from time to time throughout the term of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to establish and effectuate identity verification
procedures to obtain information which may be used to confirm the parties'
identity of such party and their authorized representatives including without
limitation name, address and organizational documents or driver's license
("Identifying Information") to the extent required by applicable law or the
policies and procedures of the Escrow Agent. The parties agree to provide the
Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties
any such Identifying Information required as a condition of opening an account
with or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent.



4.15IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help
the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
Federal law requires all financial institutions (which includes the Escrow
Agent) to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or
entity who opens an account, including any deposit or treasury management
account. What this means for the Parties: For a non-individual person such as
a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent
will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity, including a list of affiliates and subsidiaries, if necessary. The
Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. For an individual
person, the Escrow Agent may ask for your name, address, date of birth and
other information that will allow the Escrow Agent to identify you. The Escrow
Agent may also ask to see the individual's driver's license or other
identifying documents. In the event any party hereto (or their respective
Authorized Representatives) violates any of the provisions of the Section 326
of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318 or the regulations
purported thereunder, such event shall constitute a default hereunder and
shall entitle Escrow Agent to exercise all of its rights and remedies at law
or in equity, including, but not limited to, terminating this Agreement.

Full compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which
requires new employees to provide documentation/identification to establish
both identity and work authorization within 3 days of their hire. 

NOTICE: Federal law requires all employers to verify the identity and
employment eligibility of all persons hired to work in the United States. This
employer will provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) and, if
necessary, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with information from
each new employee's Form I-9 to confirm work authorization. IMPORTANT: If the
Government cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is
required to provide you written instructions and an opportunity to contact SSA
and/or DHS before taking adverse action against you, including terminating
your employment. Employers may not use E-Verify to pre-screen job applicants
or to re-verify current employees and may not limit or influence the choice of
documents presented for use on the Form I-9. In order to determine whether
Form I-9 documentation is valid, this employer uses E-Verify's photo screening
tool to match the photograph appearing on some permanent resident and
employment authorization cards with the official U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services' (USCIS) photograph. If you believe that your employer
has violated its responsibilities under this program or has discriminated
against you during the verification process based upon your national origin or
citizenship status, please call the Office of Special Counsel at
1-800-255-7688 (TDD: 1-800-237-2515). For more information on E-Verify, please
contact DHS at: 1-888-464-4218

Dear [ ____________],



The purpose of this consulting agreement (this "Agreement") is to set forth
the terms of your consulting arrangement with LendingTree, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Company").

1. Engagement as Consultant. Effective upon the consummation of the transactions (the "Closing Date") contemplated by that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated December 20, 2018, by and among the Company, Value Holding Inc., Jonathan Wu, Vincent Wu, Brian Quinn, Yueting Pen and the Sellers' Representative, you shall be engaged as a consultant to the Company ("Consultant"). Your responsibilities as Consultant shall be to render consulting services to the Company and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including, without limitation, the services listed in Exhibit A hereto (the "Services"). In your capacity as Consultant, you will be required to report to the Head of Content of the Company concerning the Services performed under this Agreement. You shall perform the Services hereunder in a reasonably competent, timely and professional manner. You will devote such business time as reasonably necessary for the performance of the Services. Subject to the requirement of reasonable business travel, you shall be entitled to render the Services from your home office. You will not be provided a Company office nor an assistant.



2.Compensation and Expenses. As consideration for the Services, the Company
shall pay to you: (a) _____________ ($______) per month for each month
(prorated for partial months) from the date hereof until the termination or
expiration of the Term. Such payments shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of each month. The Company will also reimburse you for all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of your Services, including
expenses with respect to pre-approved travel which are incurred in accordance
with the Company's travel policy. Such expenses shall be payable to you within
thirty (30) days after the Company's receipt of the invoice covering the
expenses. The Company shall have no obligation to compensate you for Services
rendered or expenses incurred after termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7 hereof; provided, that such termination shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations to compensate you for Services rendered or
reimburse you for such expenses incurred in accordance with the terms hereof
prior to such termination. By executing the below, you acknowledge and agree
that the Company's insurance coverage will not cover you or your business
activities.



3.Time and Place of Service. Unless agreed to otherwise in writing by you and
the Company, you shall render the Services at your home address set forth
above.



4.Confidentiality; Work Product; Restrictive Covenants.



(a)Confidentiality. During the Term and at all times thereafter, you agree not
to disclose or use (and will cause each of your affiliates not to so disclose
or use at any time) any Confidential Information (as defined hereinafter)
other than with respect to rendering services to the Company. Unless
prohibited by law or law enforcement, in the event you or any of your
affiliates is required by law, including a court order or subpoena, to
disclose any Confidential Information, you will promptly notify the Company in
writing, which notification will include the nature of the legal requirement
and the extent of the required disclosure, and you will shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its affiliates (at the Company's
expense) to preserve the confidentiality of such information consistent with
applicable law. As used herein, "Confidential Information" means all
proprietary or confidential information of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; provided, such information shall not include
information that: (a) is in the public domain as of the date hereof, (b)
enters the public domain after the date hereof through no action of you in
violation of this Agreement (c) is received on a non-confidential basis by you

with respect thereto; or (d) was or is independently developed by you without
reference to or use of, in whole or in part, any of the Confidential
Information.



(b)Work Product. You agree to promptly communicate to the Company's general
counsel, all inventions, ideas and other improvements made or conceived by you
either solely or jointly with others, during the Term, which result from or
are related to any of your work or Services hereunder ("Work Product"). All of
your interest in such Work Product are hereby irrevocably and perpetually
assigned to, and will remain the property of the Company, whether or not
patented or copyrighted (and without additional consideration). All Work
Product developed or acquired by you in the course of performing the Services,
as well as all information and material furnished to you by the Company in
such capacity, shall remain property of the Company or its licensors and shall

shall be returned following termination of this Agreement, unless you have
received prior written authorization to retain any such material. The Company
shall have the unrestricted right to use and disclose any Work Product it
receives from you under this Agreement without additional compensation to you.

or (ii) become employed by or otherwise render personal services to any person
in the Business; provided, however, that you and your controlled affiliates
shall not be prohibited from owning up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding

applicable, has no active participation in connection with the business of
such corporation. As used herein, "Business" means all business engaged in by

and recommendations and reviews.



(d)Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the Term, you will not, and will
cause each of your controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, offer employment to or hire any individual that is an employee of the
Company or otherwise induce or attempt to induce (whether for their own
account or for the account of any other person) any individual that is an
employee of the Company to leave the employ of the Company; provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 4(d) will prohibit any such party from: (i) using
general solicitations (including through search firms) not targeted at
employees of the Company, or employing any person who responds to such
solicitation; (ii) hiring, employing or discussing employment with any person

customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of the Company to
cease doing business with the Company or in any way interfere with the
relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business
relation and the Company.



(f)Non-Disparagement. During the Term and at all times thereafter, you will
not, directly or indirectly, disparage or defame (commercially or personally)
the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that this Section 4(f) shall
not prevent you from making statements about the Company or its affiliates in
connection with litigation or the defense or prosecution of a claim between
you and the Company or its affiliates.



(g)Reformation. The obligations contained in this Section 4 shall be construed
as a series of separate covenants, one for each country, province, state, city
or other political subdivision of the Restricted Territory. If any of such
separate covenants (or any part thereof) is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
you and the Company agree that such invalid or unenforceable covenant (or such
part) shall be eliminated from this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced.
If any of the provisions of this Section 4 are deemed to exceed the time,
geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law, you and the
Company agree that such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time,
geographic or scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable
law.



5.Relationship of the Parties.



(a)You shall perform the Services hereunder in the capacity of an independent
contractor and not as an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
divisions or affiliates, and except to the extent otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, the Company shall have no right to direct or
control the manner in which you perform such Services. Expenses of maintaining
offices and personnel, as well as other administrative and entertainment
expenses (other than the expenses as provided in Section 2), incurred by you
in the performance of Services pursuant to this Agreement shall be your sole
responsibility, and the Company's only expense for the Services shall be the
reimbursement and payment of the amounts specified in Section 2 hereof. You
agree that, except for the reimbursement of expenses, any sums paid pursuant
to this Agreement shall, for purposes of federal, state and local income
taxes, be treated as compensation for the performance of services rendered as
an independent contractor and required to be performed by you under this
Agreement and that neither you nor your successors shall take any position
inconsistent with such treatment. It is understood that your performance under
this Agreement shall not entitle you to any rights under any pension plan or
other benefit program of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, divisions, or
affiliates, including, without limitation, holiday, vacation, or sick pay, or
health or life insurance coverage or any claim of right as one of their
employees under law. You shall not hold yourself out as an employee or agent
of the Company or of any subsidiary, division or affiliate with authority to
perform any legally binding act.



(b)You agree and acknowledge that the independent contractor status of the
parties is a material term of this Agreement. You agree that any claim,
brought by you alleging an employment relationship with the Company, will
constitute a material breach of the Agreement. The parties further agree that
in the event of a legal proceeding in which you, or someone acting on your
behalf, alleges that you were an employee of the Company, the party who does
not prevail shall pay the prevailing party's reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs.

 6.Tax Returns. From and after the date of this Agreement, your relationship
with the Company and its affiliates is that of an independent contractor and
nothing herein shall be construed as creating any other relationship. As an
independent contractor performing services for the Company, payments to you
hereunder must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099. You
confirm that you have provided the Company with your correct taxpayer
identification number. You agree that you will file all tax returns and
reports required to be filed by you with respect to any payment or benefit
provided to you by the Company in connection with this Agreement on the basis
that you are an independent contractor, rather than an employee, as defined in
U.S. Treasury Regulation §31.3121(d)-1(c)(2).



7.Term. The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall be from the Closing Date
until the three month anniversary of the Closing Date unless earlier
terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties. The Company shall also
have the option to terminate this Agreement at any time upon providing notice
to you for any reason. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
remain liable to you shall be for payment of fees and expenses incurred by you
pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination and, if applicable, you
shall promptly return the laptop issued by the Company or any of its. The
provisions of this Section 7 and Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 8-12 shall survive
termination of this Agreement.



8.Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or
mailed first class, postage prepaid, as follows:

such rules are inconsistent with this Section 9(c), in which case this Section
9(c) will govern . Except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein, for
any matter submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be as it would

regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law of any
jurisdiction.



(d)EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.



10.Injunctive Relief. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties will not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or

injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction (without the
requirement of posting a bond).



11.Representations, Warranties and Additional Covenants. You hereby represent
and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof that: (a) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by you does not and will not
conflict with, breach, violate or cause a default under any contract,
agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which you are a party or
by which you are bound; (b) you are not a party to or bound by any employment
agreement, noncompetition agreement or confidentiality agreement with any
other person or entity which would reasonably be expected to in any material
way interfere with the performance of this Agreement by you; and (c) assuming
the due execution and delivery hereof by the Company, the terms of this
Agreement are valid, binding and enforceable against you, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization or moratorium laws, other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies. EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTY

(D) WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD
PARTY; WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF
PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE OR OTHERWISE.



12.Miscellaneous. This Agreement: (a) is the only agreement between you and
the Company concerning the subject matter hereof and supersede any such prior
agreement between us, (b) may only be amended or waived in a writing signed by
the parties hereto and (c) may not be assigned by either party without the
prior written consent of the other. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts and by
facsimile signature, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which together shall constitute one instrument. A signed counterpart delivered
by facsimile, email, or other means of electronic transmission shall have the
same effect as an original.
