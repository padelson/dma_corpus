perform the provisions of this Agreement or under the Equity Commitment Letter (including failing to take such actions as are required
of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and in the Equity
Commitment Letter, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to a party on the
basis that (i) such party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. In seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Equity Commitment
Letter and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, no party shall
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Until such time as the Company
pays the Company Termination Fee or Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, the remedies available to each
party pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.06</U> shall be in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Parent
or Merger Sub from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Company Termination Fee under <U>Section&nbsp;9.03(a)</U>
and <U>Section&nbsp;9.03(b)</U> or the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent
Termination Fee under <U>Section 9.03(c)</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed that Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided in this
<U>Section 10.06</U>, except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder,
under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type contemplated
by this <U>Section 10.06</U> and any monetary damages. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except for specific
performance of the type contemplated by this <U>Section 10.06</U>, under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages
payable by Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Sponsor, any of their Affiliates or any of the Parent Related Parties for breaches
of this Agreement, the Limited Guarantee, the Rollover Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount in the aggregate
equal to the lesser of (A) the Maximum Amount and (B) the sum of the Parent Termination Fee, plus (<I>x</I>) any reimbursement
obligation pursuant to <U>Section 7.14</U> or <U>Section 9.03(e)</U> and (<I>y</I>) the costs of collection and reasonable expenses
(including attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the Company&rsquo;s enforcement of its rights under
this <U>Section 10.06</U> that results in a judgment against Parent or Merger Sub; and under no circumstances will the monetary
damages payable by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of its Affiliates or any of the Company Related Parties for breaches
under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee, plus any reimbursement obligation pursuant to <U>Section

no event will any of the Company, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates or the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they
permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled
to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award of any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages,

any reimbursement obligation pursuant to <U>Section 7.14</U> or <U>Section 9.03(e)</U>, <U>plus</U> (<I>y</I>) the costs of collection

Guarantor, the Sponsor, any of their Affiliates or any of the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guarantee, the Rollover Agreement or the Transactions, the breach thereof, the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
the foregoing for any reason; and (ii) in no event will Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Sponsor, any of their Affiliates
