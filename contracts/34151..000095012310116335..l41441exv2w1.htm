AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 23, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Needle Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ "), Needle Merger Sub Corp., an Ohio corporation and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Jo-Ann Stores, Inc., an
Ohio corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.12. 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and becoming a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of its Strategic Transactions Committee (the " _Special Committee_ ") has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of Green Equity Investors V, L.P. and Green Equity Investors Side V, L.P. (each, a " _Guarantor_ " and, collectively, the " _Guarantors_ ") is entering into a limited guaranty in favor of the Company (the " _Guaranty_ ") with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Merger_  

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and 

   ##### 

  

 

the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on a date to be specified by Parent and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the third business day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another date, time, or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI at such time, the Closing shall occur instead on the earlier of (a) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than three (3) business days prior written notice to the Company and (b) the next business day after the final day of the Marketing Period. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio a certificate of merger or other appropriate document, executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the OGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the OGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the OGCL, or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the Closing Date and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions of the OGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers, immunities and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided in the OGCL and the other applicable Laws of the State of Ohio. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law (and subject to Section 5.9 hereof). 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates; Company
Stock Options_  

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the requirement of any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock (or any other equity securities of the Company) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent, either (i) convert into shares of a class of stock of the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger or (ii) be canceled. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in 

   ##### 

  

   

accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $61.00, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration, in each case in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall prior to the Closing Date enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to this Article II (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained hereto, the Paying Agent shall not disburse any part of the Exchange Fund until the Dissenters Determination Date. Pending its disbursement in satisfaction of such obligations, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Upon the date that is one business day after the Dissenters Determination Date, the Paying Agent shall disburse to Parent that portion of the Exchange Fund (if any) attributable to Dissenting Shares. If a Dissenting Shareholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to, payment of fair cash value pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, (i) such Company Common Stock shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Shareholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to, payment of fair cash value pursuant to 1701.85 of the OGCL and (y) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under Section 2.1(c). Nothing contained in this Section 2.2(a) and no investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Shares that are 

    ##### 

  

    

treated as Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(b)) to receive the
Merger Consideration or any holder of an Option to receive the Designated
Consideration, in each case as provided herein. 

   

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall, subject to Section 2.3, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.2(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are 

   ##### 

  

 

presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts any of them reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Government Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 Section 2.3 _Dissent Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are 

   ##### 

  

    

held by any shareholder who was a record holder of Company Common Stock as to
which such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed for determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of the Company Shareholders Meeting, and who
files with the Company within 10 days after such vote at the Company
Shareholders Meeting (the " _Dissenters Determination Date_ ") a written
demand to be paid the fair cash value for such shares of Company Common Stock
that have not been voted in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement at
the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Sections 1701.84 and
1701.85 of the OGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.1(c), unless and until such shareholder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses such shareholders rights as a
dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such shareholder (a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses any such rights as a Dissenting Shareholder, that shareholders
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into only the right to receive at the Effective Time the
Merger Consideration, without interest. Subject to the preceding sentence,
from and after the Effective Time, each shareholder who has asserted rights
as a Dissenting Shareholder as provided in Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of

 Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. 

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Ohio. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company. 

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any effect, change, event or occurrence (whether or not constituting any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement) that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects, changes, events or occurrences, has a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, assets, liabilities or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the following, and no effects, changes, events or occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, arising out of, resulting from or attributable to any of the following shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur: (A) conditions generally affecting (1) the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or (2) the economy, credit or financial or capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, or (B) effects, changes, events or occurrences to the extent arising out of, resulting from or attributable to (1) actual or prospective changes after the date of this Agreement in Law or in generally accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards or in the interpretation or 

   ##### 

  

   

enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any changes or prospective changes in
general legal, regulatory or political conditions, (2) the announcement of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions (other than for
purposes of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.3(c) and
Section 3.4), (3) acts of war or military action, sabotage or terrorism, or
any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war or military action,
sabotage or terrorism, (4) earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural
disasters, (5) any action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries (x) that
is required by this Agreement (other than with respect to the Companys
obligations to comply with Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.4), (y) taken with
Parents written consent or (z) at Parents written request, (6) any change
resulting or arising from the identity of, or any facts or
circumstances relating to, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, (7) any change or prospective change in the Companys credit
ratings, (8) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume, of
the capital stock of the Company or (9) any failure to meet any internal
or public projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates of revenue, earnings,
cash flow or cash position (it being understood that the exceptions in
clauses (7), (8) and (9) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that the underlying cause of any such decline or failure
referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions
provided by clause (A) and clauses (B)(1) through (6) hereof) is a Material
Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _however_ , that any effect, change, event
or occurrence referred to in clause (A) or clause (B)(1), (3) or (4) may be
taken into account in determining whether or not there has been a Material
Adverse Effect solely if such effect, change, event or occurrence has a
materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate (in which case
only the incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into
account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
or would reasonably be expected to occur). 

   

 (c) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(iv), or would have caused the representation in clause (v) of this Section
3.2(c) not to be true and correct. The aggregate amount of all participant
contributions under the ASOP with respect to the "Accumulation Period" (as
defined in the ASOP) ending on March 31, 2011, will not exceed $1,250,000.

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (except for directors qualifying shares or the like) are owned directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Company free and clear of all Liens and transfer restrictions, except as set forth on Section 3.2(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or 

   ##### 

  

    

other applicable securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other

Subsidiary of the Company, which is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Company, is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights, and there are no subscriptions, options, warrants,

conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or
agreement, any agreements granting any preemptive rights, subscription
rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with
respect to any securities of any Subsidiary. Except for the Company
Stock Plans, the SVBP and the Company 401(k) Plan, none of the Subsidiaries
has any outstanding equity compensation plans or policies relating to the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any Subsidiary of
the Company. Except for the Company Stock Plans, the SVBP and the Company

under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to

 Section 4.4 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to the Transactions, and prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any other business activities other than those relating to the Transactions. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed commitment letter (the " _Equity Funding Letter_ ") from Green Equity Investors V, L.P. and Green Equity Investors Side V, L.P. (collectively the " _Equity Providers_ " and each an " _Equity Provider_ ") to each purchase for cash, in each case subject to the terms and conditions therein, equity securities of Parent in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) executed commitment letters and Redacted Fee Letter from the financial institutions identified therein (the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Equity Funding Letter, the " _Financing_  

   ##### 

  

 

 _Letters_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred
to as the " _Debt Financing_ ", and together with the Equity Financing
collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, none
of the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letters has been amended
or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and the
respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Equity
Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior
to the date hereof, and the Financing Letters are in full force and effect and
are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub, and, with respect to the Equity Funding Letter, each of the
Guarantors, as the case may be, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the date hereof, there are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by
the Financing Letters (including any "market flex" provisions applicable to
the Financing Letters). Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance
with the Equity Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letters, as applicable,
(ii) the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III (without giving effect to any materiality
or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or any Knowledge qualifications)
and (iii) the performance by the Company of its obligations under
Section 5.1, as of the date hereof, the net proceeds contemplated by the
Equity Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letters will, together with
Company cash, in the aggregate, be sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and Designated Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing
of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Letters) and any
other amounts required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, under the Equity Funding Letter or the
Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that Parent is not making any
representation or warranty regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties in Article III. As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing;
_provided_ that Parent is not making any representation regarding the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, or
compliance by the Company of its obligations hereunder. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing
other than (i) as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters, (ii) any
customary engagement letter(s) and non-disclosure agreements(s), and (iii) as
do not impact the conditionality or aggregate amount of the Financing. 

   

 Section 4.6 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full 

   ##### 

  

 

force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each
Guarantor, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of such Guarantor under
such Guaranty, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. 

   

 Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to the Transactions, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, (c) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III (without giving effect to any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications or any Knowledge qualifications), (d) the performance by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.1, (e) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, (f) payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and (g) payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature, and (d) such Person is not insolvent under Section 1336 of the Ohio Revised Code (the Ohio Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act). For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

 Section 4.8 _Certain Arrangements_. Except as previously disclosed to the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or arrangements or commitments to enter into Contracts or arrangements (i) between Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Transactions or (ii) pursuant to which any

any shareholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim 

   ##### 

  

 

against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their

As of the date of this Agreement, there is no pending, or to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened, Action against Parent or Merger Sub or injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree or writ imposed upon Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, by or before any Governmental Authority, that seeks to enjoin, or would reasonably be likely to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering with, any of the Transactions, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement need not prohibit the submission of Takeover Proposals or amendments thereto to the Companys Board of Directors (or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof). 

  

 (b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as permitted by Section 5.2(c), the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to (i) from 12:00 a.m. (New York City time) on February 15, 2011 (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations (or other efforts) with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal and request that any such Person promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person information in connection with or for the purpose of

Proposal. 

   

 (c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b) or any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Takeover Proposal was made or renewed on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and did not result from any breach of this Section 5.2, (A) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Companys Board of Directors (or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with and receiving the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) provide to Parent an unredacted (except, prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, for the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal, which may be redacted during such period) copy of any such Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any financing commitments (including any Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto) and (ii) provide to Parent a written summary of the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made in writing (including any financing commitments and any Redacted Fee Letters relating thereto). 

  

 (d) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal (whether made before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date) on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) and upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.2. 

  

 (e) _No Change in Recommendation or Company Acquisition Agreement_. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(e) or Section 5.2(f), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to its shareholders 

   ##### 

  

 

that the Company Shareholder Approval be given (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") or fail to include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) take or fail to take any
formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement
in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than
a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication (it being understood that the Board of Directors of the Company
may refrain from taking a position with respect to a Takeover Proposal until
the close of business as of the tenth (10th) business day after the
commencement of a tender offer in connection with such Takeover Proposal
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered such an adverse modification) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company
a Takeover Proposal (the actions described in this clause (i) being referred
to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause
or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iii) take any action pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, the Board of Directors of the Company may make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement or take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) if the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) there is a
reasonable probability that the failure to do so would cause the Board of
Directors of the Company to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) the Company has given
Parent at least four (4) calendar days prior written notice of its intention
to take such action (which notice shall include an unredacted copy of the
Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and an unredacted copy of any financing commitments (including
Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto and a written summary of the material
terms of any Superior Proposal not made in writing, including any
financing commitments (including Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto), (2)
the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith with Parent during the three (3) calendar day period after
giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms
of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guaranty such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3)
following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the
Company or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof shall
have considered in good faith such binding offer, and shall have determined
that the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed in such binding offer were to be given effect and (4) in
the event of any material change to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an 

    ##### 

  

    

additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the
notice period shall have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be
at least one business day (rather than the four (4) calendar days otherwise
contemplated by clause (1) above); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall
be void and of no force and effect, unless the Company termination is in
accordance with Section 7.1 and, to the extent required under the terms of
this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the applicable Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with such termination. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board of Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that there is a reasonable probability that the failure to take such action would cause the Board of Directors of the Company to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such action shall not be in response to a Takeover Proposal or a Superior Proposal (which is addressed under Section 5.2(e)) and prior to taking such action, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has given Parent at least four (4) calendar days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for the Change of Recommendation, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the three (3) calendar day period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guaranty in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such Change of Recommendation and (z) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that there is a reasonable probability that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would cause the Board of Directors of the Company to violate its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law. 

  

 (g) Nothing in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that, subject to Section 5.2(e)(i)(C), any disclosure permitted under this Section 5.2(g) that does not contain either an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) complying with its disclosure obligations under 

   ##### 

  

 

applicable Law; _provided_ that this clause (ii) shall not in any way limit
or modify the effect, if any, that any such disclosure would have under the
other provisions of Section 5.2. 

   

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or more; in each case, other than the Merger Transactions. 

  

 (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects (including certainty of closing) of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders (solely in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the Merger Transactions (including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise);  _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Company shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment, recess or postponement thereof, the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approvals, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.2, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, and with Parents consent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the Company

or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting. 

   

 (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in any event by January 18, 2011), the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments; _provided_ that the Company shall be under no obligation to mail the Proxy Statement to its shareholders prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent in good faith.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub

for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. In the
event that the Company is required to file any other transaction statement or
information statement pursuant to SEC rules in connection with the
Merger Transactions (excluding current reports filed on Form 8-K and
additional proxy materials filed on Schedule 14-A) (any such other
transaction statement or information statement, an " _Other Filing_ "), the
provisions of this Section 5.3 relating to the Proxy Statement shall apply
to such Other Filing _mutatis mutandis_. 

   

 Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iv) defend or contest any claim, suit, action or other proceeding brought by a third party that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Transactions, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iv) other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in Section 5.4(c) below.

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all reasonable actions to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws and (y) if the restrictions of any state takeover statute or similar Law become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated

 (d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other party with respect to information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than "4(c) documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act, and (iv) to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in and consult with the other party in advance regarding, any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Transactions.

information and documents as requested by any such Governmental Antitrust
Entity or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation

 Section 5.5 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters (including any applicable "market flex" provisions), it being understood and agreed that a portion of the Financing may consist of a High Yield Note Transaction. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision under the Financing Letters, if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) with respect to the Financing Letters, reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing unless the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount no later than the date of such amendment, modification or waiver, (B) imposes additional conditions precedent to the initial availability of the Debt Financing or amends or modifies any of the existing conditions to the initial funding of the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay, prevent or render materially less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, in each of clauses (B) and (C), in any material respect. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement. For purposes of this Section 5.5, references to " _Financing_ " and " _Debt Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters (including a High Yield Note Transaction referred to in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Redacted Fee Letter) as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a), and references to " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each party to this Agreement confirms its understanding and agreement that (a) a portion of the Financing may consist of a High Yield Note Transaction in addition to or in lieu of a portion of other Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, and (b) the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 5.5(b) shall apply to both a High Yield Note Transaction and such other Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. 

  

 (ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters until the Merger Transactions are consummated; (B) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (including any applicable "market flex" provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including any applicable "market flex" provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letters; 

   ##### 

  

 

 _provided_ that to the extent that a portion of the Debt Financing is funded
pursuant to a High Yield Note Transaction, the amount of the other Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters may be reduced
accordingly and definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing so
reduced need not be negotiated or entered into; (C) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letters that are within its
control (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Equity Funding Letter) and consummate the
Debt Financing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letters (or terms otherwise acceptable to Parent and the
applicable financing source) at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ that to
the extent that a portion of the Debt Financing is funded pursuant to a High
Yield Note Transaction, the amount of the other Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters may be reduced accordingly and the Debt
Financing so reduced need not be consummated; (D) enforce its rights under
the Debt Financing Commitments and cause the lenders and other Persons
providing Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required
to consummate the Merger Transactions; and (E) comply in all material
respects with its covenants and other obligations under the Financing
Letters. 

   

 (iii) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of the material definitive documents for the Financing and shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any breach of any material provisions of any of the Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing by any party to any Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing of which it has actual knowledge; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from a financing source for the Financing with respect to any: (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or any material provisions of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing; and (C) of the occurrence of an event or development that Parent or Merger Sub expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to the immediately preceding sentence; provided that Merger Sub shall not be required to provide any information to the extent it would result in the waiver of an attorney-client privilege or violate any applicable confidentiality obligation in the Debt Commitment Letters. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any applicable "market flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (x) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company and (y) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger Transactions with terms and 

   ##### 

  

 

conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate (including the

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information 

   ##### 

   

 

in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or
risk waiver of such privilege. Without limiting the generality of

managements internal use, (ii) any update of its outlook for the quarter
or the balance of the fiscal year as it may prepare for managements internal
use and (iii) monthly same store results. All requests for information made

   ##### 

   

 

Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee
or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in
each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective
Time (including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating
in whole or in part to the Transactions or the enforcement of this provision
or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume
all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in
respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries or in any agreement in existence as of the date hereof and filed
as an exhibit to or scheduled as an exhibit to any Company SEC Document
providing for indemnification between the Company and any director. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time until
six years from the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by
Law, the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time until six
years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.9 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.9) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, _provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 5.9(a). 

   

 (b) The Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.9 (each, a " _Claim_ ");  _provided_ that none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 (c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, if the annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.9(c) and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9). 

   

 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.9. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. 

   

 Section 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) with respect to those employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are actively employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), (A) base salary and annual target bonus opportunities which are no less favorable than the base salary and annual cash target bonus opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) pension and welfare benefits and perquisites that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (C) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and set forth on Section 5.11(a)(i)(C) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) with respect to the Vice Presidents, Corporate Managers, District Managers and Director level employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are actively employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Designated Company Employees_ "), long-term performance-based incentive opportunities which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the long-term equity and equity-based incentive opportunities (other than the ASOP) (whether payable in equity or in cash) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Designated Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company Employee. 

   

 (b) For purposes of vesting, vacation and sick time credit and eligibility to participate (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately 

      ##### 

  

    

prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the agreements identified in Section 5.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (d) The Company shall be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, (I) to pay annual bonuses for fiscal 2011 in an amount equal to the annual bonus earned by participants for the 2011 fiscal year and (II) to establish bonus targets, maximums and performance goals for fiscal 2012 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

   

 (e) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or "change of control" within the meaning of each Company Plan will occur upon the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates from entering into agreements with members of management for post-Closing employment with the Company or its Affiliates and/or the acquisition of securities of Parent (whether in exchange for securities of the Company held by such members of management or otherwise) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (any such agreement, a "Management Agreement"); provided that no such Management Agreement may be entered into on or prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and each Management Agreement shall provide for termination upon 

      ##### 

  

    

any termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. For the
avoidance of doubt, any equity interests in the Company contributed to Parent
pursuant to a Management Agreement shall be deemed held by Parent as of the
Closing for all purposes of Article II. 

   

 (g) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of any Company Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement, (ii) limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the Effective Time, or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right (x) in any Person, including any current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any participant in any Company Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (y) to continued employment with Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge on the one hand and Parents knowledge, on the other hand, threatened against such party which relate to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent. 

  

 Section 5.13 _SEC Filings_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall file with or furnish to the SEC, on a timely basis, all required registration statements, certifications, reports (including annual, quarterly and periodic reports) and proxy statements with the SEC, including any required Other Filings. In addition, from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time and the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company will continue to file with the SEC quarterly financial data on Form 8-K in accordance with past practice. 

  

 Section 5.14 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than with respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company two days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 1701.54 of the 

   ##### 

  

 

OGCL and in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the Agreement.

 (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i); or 

   

 (ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii); 

 

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.3(b), if at

Company a termination fee of $90,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination

expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates

amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further

respect to Section 7.3(d)). For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to
Section 7.2(ii), (1) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and
any payment pursuant to Section 7.3(d)) and (2) while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.8 and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 7.3(b), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a

avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 7.2(ii) and Section 7.3(f), (1)

 Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles, except to the extent the provisions of the OGCL are mandatorily applicable to the Merger. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 8.7(c), all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.7(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in Section 8.10 of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; 

    #####

 Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 8.7(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 7.3 (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than with respect to the Equity Financing) shall be subject to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions in Section 6.1 and 6.2 were satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2, including the proviso therein, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 5.5(a) of this Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably 

   ##### 

  

   

confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of
it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
8.8 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. 

   

 Section 8.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 Section 8.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Interpretation_. 

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words " _include_ ", " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words " _without limitation_ ". The words " _hereof_ ", " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The terms "or", "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". A statement that an effect, change, event or occurrence has or has not had, or would or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect shall mean that all such effects, changes, events or occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, have or have not had, or would or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
