in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II (such cash amount being
hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained hereto, the Paying Agent shall not disburse any part of the Exchange Fund until the
Dissenters Determination Date. Pending its disbursement in satisfaction of such obligations, the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i)&nbsp;short-term direct

surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a

otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)&nbsp;the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule,
such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words &#147;<U>include</U>&#148;, &#147;<U>includes</U>&#148; or
&#147;<U>including</U>&#148; are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
&#147;<U>without limitation</U>&#148;. The words &#147;<U>hereof</U>&#148;, &#147;<U>herein</U>&#148; and &#147;<U>hereunder</U>&#148;
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The terms &#147;or&#148;, &#147;any&#148; and &#147;either&#148; are not
exclusive. The word &#147;extent&#148; in the phrase &#147;to the extent&#148; shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply &#147;if&#148;. The word &#147;will&#148; shall
be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word &#147;shall&#148;. A statement that an effect,
change, event or occurrence has or has not had, or would or would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect shall mean that all such effects, changes, events or occurrences,
individually or in the aggregate, have or have not had, or would or would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors.
