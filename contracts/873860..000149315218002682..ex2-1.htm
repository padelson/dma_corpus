have the right to dispute the Company's legal analysis in determining the
amount of cash that is distributable in accordance with Section 2-311 or any
other applicable provisions of the MGCL, including whether or not any specific
cash is available for distribution; and provided, further, that for the
avoidance of doubt Parent and Merger Sub may dispute the actual
calculation of Available Cash. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve
any dispute regarding the Company Net Worth and/or Available Cash within the
Resolution Period, the Parties shall promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) after the end of the Resolution Period submit the disputed
items to Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is not available, a mutually
acceptable nationally recognized accounting firm that has not provided
material services to either the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates in the preceding three years (the " _Independent Accountant_ ").
The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountant to render a decision to
the disputed items as soon as practicable (and in any event within 10
days) after the submission to it of the disputed items. Each of the Company
and Parent shall make available to the Independent Accountant all
information, records, data and working papers as may be reasonably requested
by the Independent Accountant in connection with the resolution of the
disputed items; _provided_ that if the estimates of the Company Net Worth
and/or Available Cash delivered by the Company in accordance with the first
sentence of this _Section 3.1(b)_ was calculated as of the date in clause (b)
of the definition of Applicable Month End, the Company will update such
calculation to reflect the more recent date in clause (a) of such definition
and deliver such updated calculation to Parent and to the Independent
Accountant as promptly as practicable, and the determination of the
Independent Accountant hereunder shall be made with respect to such updated
calculation (unless Parent agrees with such updated calculation, in which
case a determination by the Independent Accountant shall not be required).
The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
calculate, based solely on the written submissions of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, and not by independent investigation,
regarding the disputed items and shall be instructed that its calculation (i)
must be made in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and (ii)
with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values
established for such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned
to such amount by the Company and by Parent. Except for any dispute to the
extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this Agreement, the
determination of the Independent Accountant concerning any item in dispute
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties without further right
of appeal. The cost of the Independent Accountant in connection with its
services pursuant to this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be shared equally by the
Company and Parent.

Section 3.4 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event within one
Business Day), the Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited (i)
with a paying agent selected by Parent (subject to the consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the Company) (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of (A) certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (B) uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this

and such Certificate so surrendered and any such Uncertificated Shares so
transferred shall forthwith be cancelled.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, Merger Consideration in respect of
the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such holder's Certificate or
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

  



  

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on
the stock transfer books of Company Capital Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with, the procedures set forth
in this _Article III_.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying
Agent pursuant to _(a_ ) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at
the request of Parent, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 3.4_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, none of the Acquirer Parties, the Company,
the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

  



  

(f) The Paying Agent will invest all cash included in the Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash will be
limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, and, in any
such case, no such instrument will have a maturity exceeding three months, and
that no such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Article
III_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be
paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent will promptly
replace or restore the portion of the Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. The Fund will not be used for any purpose
other than the foregoing.

Section 3.5 _Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period (for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as
of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under
the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(b) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Company pays any cash dividend (subject to Parent's
consent right pursuant to _Section 6.1_ of this Agreement, if any), the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted such that the aggregate
amount of consideration payable in respect of Company Common Stock, Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company Time-Based RCUs and Company Restricted
Shares pursuant to this _Article III_ will be reduced by the aggregate amount
of such cash dividend paid to holders of Company Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Withholding_. Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries, the Paying Agent, and the Rights Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under all applicable
Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Dissenter 's Rights_. In accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1) of
the MGCL and the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, no dissenters' or
appraisal rights will be available to stockholders with respect to the
Merger.

or material correspondence with, the party making such Superior Company
Proposal, including the then-current form of the definitive agreements with
respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal
shall require a new Company Notice of Superior Proposal and trigger a new
Superior Proposal Notice Period, except that any such new Superior
Proposal Notice Period shall be three Business Days instead of five Business
Days). The Company Board may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in respect of a Superior Company Proposal if any such Superior Company
Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this _Section 7.4_.

(e) In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Company Board may (subject to the requirements of _Section 7.4(f)_ ),
prior to (but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3-105 of the MGCL,
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company
Intervening Event if the Company Board determines (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business Day (the
" _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") following Parent's receipt of written
notice (a " _Company Notice of Intervening Event_ ") from the Company
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, including
the material facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening Event.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may not (i)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ unless at the end of the last Superior Proposal
Notice Period, the Company Board determines (after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors) that the Company Takeover Proposal
(after giving effect to any amendments thereto) continues to constitute a
Superior Company Proposal, or (ii) make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 7.4(e) _ unless at the end of the last
Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law. Further, in
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4(d_ ) or _Section 7.4(e)_ ,
the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to a Company
Notice of Superior Proposal, Company Notice of Intervening Event or
otherwise; _provided_ , that if requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period or Intervening Event
Notice Period (as applicable), negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that this Agreement results in a
transaction that (A) in the case of a Company Takeover Proposal, is no less
favorable to the stockholders of the Company than such Company Takeover
Proposal that would be deemed to constitute a Superior Company Proposal in the
absence of such adjustments or (B) in the case of a Company Intervening
Event, enables the Company Board to determine (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is not reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; it being understood and
agreed that, in the event Parent agrees to make such adjustments as set forth
in clause (A) and (B), as applicable, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall be made. The Company agrees that any violation of this _Section 7.4_ by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is (i) a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a senior-
level employee (i.e., a managing director (or similar title) or more senior)
of any financial advisor to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) a
partner of any outside legal counsel to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 7.4_ by the Company.

advise Parent orally of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably current basis (and in no event later than 24
hours from the occurrence or existence of any material event, fact or
circumstance) of any change in the status or material terms of any Company
Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof copies of all material correspondence and
other written material documentation exchanged between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions
of any Company Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to Applicable Law,
Parent will give prompt notice to the Company and the Company will give prompt
notice to Parent of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event whose
occurrence or failure to occur would cause (a) any representation or warranty

respect or (b) a material failure of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, as the case may be, to comply with or

incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any

Parties (as defined below) than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries. From and after

foregoing, collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements (" _Losses_ "), incurred or arising in connection with any
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
regulatory, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the

maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) provide substitute
polices for the Company and its current and former directors and officers
(and any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective
Time) who are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by
the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries in either case, of
not less than the amount of existing coverage and have other terms and from
carriers not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event will the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ended
December 31, 2017 (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 7.7_ it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date, the Company may, upon prior
written notice to Parent, purchase a "tail" directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual
who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who are
currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company. In the event the Company purchases such tail
coverage, the Surviving Corporation will cease to have any obligations under
the first sentence of this _Section 7.7(c)_.

this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition or acquisition by the Company's
directors and officers of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,

Acquirer Parties and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth

provisions of this Agreement were not performed (including failing to take
such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if

that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1_ , the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court

remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.
