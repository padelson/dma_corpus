ARTICLE 2

 

SALE OF ASSETS/PURCHASE PRICE

 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Assets_. Subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell and assign to Buyer,
and Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire from Seller the Assets, effective as
of the Effective Time.

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The total purchase price, subject to adjustment in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to be paid to Seller by Buyer for
the Assets is ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION Dollars ($173,000,000) (the "
_Base Purchase Price_ "). The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as set
forth in _Section 2.4_ (as so adjusted, the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ ")
post-Closing in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

 

2.3 _Receipts and Credits_.

 

(a) _Allocation of Income and Costs_.

 

(i) Buyer (A) shall be entitled to all revenues, production, proceeds, income,
and products from or attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective
Time, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts, and credits earned
(including delay rentals, shut-in royalties, and lease bonuses) with respect
to the Assets from and after the Effective Time, and (B) shall be responsible
for (and entitled to any refunds and indemnities with respect to) all
Operating Expenses incurred from and after the Effective Time; and

 

(ii) Seller (A) shall be entitled to all revenues, production, proceeds,
income, and products from or attributable to the Assets prior to the
Effective Time, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts, and credits
earned (including delay rentals, shut-in royalties, and lease bonuses) with
respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and (B) shall
be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds and indemnities with respect
to) all Operating Expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time.

 



13 (iii) Seller (A) shall be entitled to all revenues, production,
proceeds, income, and products from or attributable to the Retained
Interests, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts, and credits earned
(including delay rentals, shut-in royalties, and lease bonuses) with respect
to the Retained Interests before, on and after the Effective Time, and (B)
shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds and indemnities with
respect to) all Operating Expenses with respect to the Retained Interests
incurred before, on and after the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Determinations_. The terms "earned" and "incurred," as used in this
Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States and the standards established by
the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies, Inc. For purposes of this
_Section 2.3_, determination of whether Operating Expenses are attributable
to the period before or after the Effective Time shall be based on when
services are rendered, when the goods are delivered, or when the work is
performed. For clarification, the date an item or work is ordered is not
the date of such transaction for interpretive purposes, but rather the date
on which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or the date on which
the work ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date. For purposes of
allocating Hydrocarbon production, revenues, proceeds, income, accounts
receivable, and products under this _Section 2.3_:

(i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Oil and Gas Properties when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the
storage facilities into which they are run, or, if there is no such facility,
the applicable lease automatic custody transfer meters through which they are
run; and

(ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Oil and Gas Properties when they pass through the delivery point sales meters
on the pipelines through which they are transported.

 

(c) _Allocation of Taxes_. Taxes, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and
other Operating Expenses that are paid periodically shall be prorated based
on the number of days in the applicable period falling before, and the number
of days in the applicable period falling at or after, the Effective Time,
except that Hydrocarbon production, severance and similar Taxes shall be
prorated based on the number of units actually produced, purchased or sold or
proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Imbalances_. If as of the Effective Time there exists (i) an Imbalance
owing to Seller with respect to the incremental interest in any PDP Well that
Buyer is entitled to as of such time, as more particularly described in the
definition of PDP Wells, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the value of such
Imbalance as of such time, with the value to be based on the then
current sales price being received on such date under the applicable
Marketing Contract for such Hydrocarbons, and (ii) an Imbalance owed by Seller
with respect to the incremental interest in any PDP Well that Buyer is
entitled to as of such time, as more particularly described in the definition
of PDP Wells, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the value of such Imbalance as of
such time, with the value to be based on the then current sales price being
received on such date under the applicable Marketing Contract for such
Hydrocarbons.

 



14 (e) _Payments_. Except to the extent the Base Purchase Price is adjusted in
respect of such amount as provided in _Section 2.4_, if Buyer or Seller
receives any amount to which the other is entitled pursuant to this _Section
2.3_, such receiving Party will account for and transmit such amount to the
other as provided under _Section 2.5_. If Buyer or Seller pays any amount
for which the other is obligated pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, such paying
Party will notify the other Party, and such other Party shall account to the
other Party as provided under _Section 2.5_.

2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted,
without duplication, as follows:

(a) Upward by the sum of the following:

liquids inventories and ethane, propane, iso-butane, nor-butane, and gasoline
inventories produced from the Wells in storage as of the Effective Time
(excluding pipeline inventories and linefill), with the value to be based on
the then current sales price being received on such date under the applicable
Marketing Contract for such Hydrocarbons, less amounts payable therefrom as
royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens upon, measured by or payable
in respect of such Hydrocarbons;

 

(ii) an amount equal to all Operating Expenses paid by Seller that are
attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective Time, whether paid
before or after the Effective Time, including, without duplication of any
other amounts set forth in this _Section 2.4(a)_;

 

(iii) without duplication of any other amounts set forth in this _Section
2.4(a)_, the amount of all Taxes, if any, allocated to Buyer pursuant to
_Article 9_ but paid by Seller;

(iv) an amount equal to the value of Imbalances owing to Seller as of the
Effective Time, with the value to be based on the then current sales price
being received on such date under the applicable Marketing Contract for such
Hydrocarbons; and

 

(v) except as expressly provided otherwise herein, any other amount provided
for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties.

(b) Downward by the sum of the following:

 

(i) an amount equal to all proceeds received by Seller for the sale of the
Hydrocarbons produced from the Wells from and after the Effective Time less
amounts actually paid by Seller as royalties, overriding royalties and other
burdens measured by or payable out of such production, and less severance
taxes actually paid by Seller applicable to such production, except
as otherwise accounted for pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(i)_;

 



15 (ii) without duplication of any other amounts set forth in this  _Section
2.4(b)_, the amount of all Taxes, if any, allocated to Seller pursuant to

pursuant to _Sections 7.2_ ,

(v) an amount equal to the Suspended Funds; and

(vi) except as expressly provided otherwise herein, any other amount provided
for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties.

(c) To the extent applicable, the Adjustments pursuant to this  _Section
2.4_ shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.

2.5  _Final Settlement Statement_. No later than 120 Days after the Closing
Date Seller will deliver to Buyer the final settlement statement (the " _Final
Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth the actual amounts of Adjustments and
the resulting Adjusted Purchase Price, together with associated back-up
documentation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
30 Days after Buyer receives the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer may deliver
to Seller a written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes to be
made to such statement. If Buyer fails to timely deliver the written report to
Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final Settlement
Statement, the statement as delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct
and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further audit
or arbitration. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
15 Days after Seller receives Buyers written report, the Parties shall meet
and undertake to agree on the final adjustments to the Final Settlement
Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on the final adjustments within such
15-Day period, either Party may submit the disputed items to the Accounting
Referee for resolution. The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to
resolve the disputes within 20 Days after having the relevant materials
submitted for review. The decision of the Accounting Referee will be binding
on and non-appealable by the Parties. The fees and expenses associated with
the Accounting Referee will be borne equally by the Parties. Any amounts owed
by one Party to the other as a result of the Final Settlement Statement,
together with interest on such amount from (and including) the Closing Date
to (and excluding) the date of payment at the Prime Rate, will be paid within
5 Business Days after the date when the amounts are agreed upon by the Parties
or the Parties receive a decision of the Accounting Referee, and the
Adjustments included in the Final Settlement Statement will be final and
binding between the Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration.

Claim Notice within such time as will allow the indemnifying Party
a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the underlying
Claim; provided failure to do so shall not affect an indemnified Persons
rights hereunder except for, and only to the extent of, any incremental
increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to
give notice.

 



19 3.7 _Defense of Non-Party Claims_. Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice
involving a Non-Party for which an indemnifying Party believes it may have an
obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall, if
it so elects in accordance with this _Section 3.7_ (without prejudice to its
right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume
the defense of the Non-Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnifying
Party, and the indemnified Person shall cooperate in all reasonable respects.
If any Non-Party Claim involves a fact pattern wherein each Party may have an
obligation to indemnify the other Party, each Party may assume the defense of
and hire counsel for that portion of the Non-Party Claim for which it may have
an obligation of indemnity. In all instances, the indemnified Person may
employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Non-Party Claim;
provided, if the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Non-Party
Claim pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ and has agreed to indemnify the
indemnified Person, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
indemnified Person shall be borne solely by the indemnified Person. If the
indemnifying Party elects by written notice to undertake the defense of the
Non-Party Claim within 30 Days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice,
then (i) the indemnifying Party shall defend the indemnified Person against
such Non-Party Claim, (ii) the indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment
entered or settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim, (iii) the
indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim that (A) does not
include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases
the indemnified Person from all liability with respect to such Non-Party
Claim, or (B) would restrict such indemnified Persons ability to conduct its
business in the ordinary course, and (iv) the indemnified Person shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to such Non-Party Claim without the indemnifying Partys prior written
consent. If the indemnifying Party has not elected to undertake the defense
of a Non-Party Claim, or if the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Non-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ but fails to diligently defend
against the Non-Party Claim within 30 Days following any written notice from
such indemnified Person asserting such failure, then the indemnified Person
shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the
indemnifying Party (to the extent the indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder), the Non-Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings. In such instances, the indemnified Person shall have full control
of such defense and proceedings; provided, the indemnified Person shall not
settle such Non-Party Claim without the written consent of the indemnifying
Party; provided further, if the indemnifying Party fails to notify the
indemnified Person in writing as to whether or not it consents to such
settlement within 30 Days following its receipt of notice of such settlement
from the indemnified Person, then such consent shall be deemed given. The
indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by an indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section
3.7_, and the indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
_Section 3.7_, if the indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
the indemnified Person under this  _Section 3.7_ and if such dispute is
resolved in favor of the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall not
be required to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified Persons defense
pursuant to this  _Section 3.7_.

 



20 3.8 _Investigation and Knowledge_. The right to indemnification or other
remedy based on the inaccuracy of or non-compliance with any representation
or warranty in this Agreement shall not be enforceable to the extent the Party
claiming indemnity or other remedy had Knowledge of such inaccuracy of or
noncompliance prior to Closing.

 

3.9 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each of the Parties expressly waives and
releases, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive and release, special,
punitive, remote, unforeseeable, speculative and exemplary damages with
respect to any dispute arising under, related to, or in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement, contract or instrument contemplated herein
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.10 _Extent of Indemnification_. Without limiting the scope of
the indemnification, disclaimer, release and assumption obligations set forth
in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, an indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder in accordance with the
terms hereof, regardless of whether the Claim or indemnifiable loss giving
rise to any such Indemnity Obligation is the result of the sole, partial,
active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, gross negligence,
strict liability, other legal fault or responsibility, or violation of any
Law of or by any such indemnified Person.

material compliance with applicable permits and no event has occurred which

, to Sellers Knowledge the Equipment and the Central Facilities are in an
operable state of repair adequate to maintain normal operations in accordance
with the methods and practices of a prudent operator of oil and gas properties
in Karnes County, Texas, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Seller or, to
Sellers Knowledge, the respective operator of the Oil and Gas Properties, has
all material easements, rights of way, licenses and authorizations, from
Governmental Authorities and Non-Parties necessary to access, construct,
operate, maintain and repair the Equipment and the Central Facilities in the
ordinary course of business as currently conducted and in material compliance
with all Laws, except such failures would not individually or in the

operations in accordance with the methods and practices of a prudent operator
of oil and gas properties in Karnes County, Texas, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and, without limiting the foregoing, do not contain junk or other
obstructions which could reasonably be expected to materially interfere with
drilling, completion, and recompletion, stimulation, or other operations on,
with respect to, or affecting the Assets.

 

5.22 _Non-Consent Operations_. Seller has not elected not to participate in
any operation or activity proposed with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties

becoming subject to a penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not
to participate in such operation or activity.

 

5.23 _Casualty Loss; Condemnation_. Since January 1, 2013, to Sellers
Knowledge (i) there has not been any material Casualty Loss to or
Condemnation of any Asset and (ii) no Condemnation is pending or threatened
against the Assets.

any material amounts to Non-Parties, in order to fulfill the foregoing
obligation, and provided further, the foregoing obligation shall apply only to
the extent the Parties own an interest in the oil and gas leases, wells and

7.2 _Consents_.

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the consents
set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ which have not been obtained or waived as of the

obtain such consents, but, in each case, without being obligated to pay any
consideration or waive or release any right or privilege to obtain such
consent. If the Parties are not able to effect the assignment of any of the
Assets at Closing due to the lack of a required Non-Party consent to transfer
the same, then, except as otherwise provided herein, such Assets shall not,
and shall not be deemed to be, assigned at Closing.

 

(b) As to any Contract (subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.2(d)_),
until any such consent is obtained, to the extent permissible under Law and
under the terms of such Contract, Seller shall post-Closing (i) continue to

forward to Buyer any monies or other benefits received that are attributable
to such Contract and Buyer shall fully indemnify and hold harmless Seller with
respect to any costs, claims or liabilities arising thereunder, and (iii)

this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall continue only for so long as Seller holds an
interest in any portion of the Retained Interests.

(c) If the assignment of a Lease, Contract or Surface Contract is subject to a
consent requirement other than Customary Post-Closing Consents and (i) the
Person holding such consent right is not a Governmental Authority, (ii) the
Lease, Contract or Surface Contract does not contain language to the effect
that the lessor or counterparty thereto (as applicable) will have the right
to terminate the Lease, Contract or Surface Contract if an assignment is made
without the consent requirement being satisfied, (iii) the failure to obtain
such consent would not cause the assignment to Buyer to be void or voidable,
and (iv) the holder of such consent right has not denied such consent in
writing, then such Lease, Contract or Surface Contract shall be assigned to
Buyer at Closing and following the Closing Seller and Buyer shall continue,
for 180 Days, to use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required

180-Day period the required consent has not been obtained, then the Parties
shall discuss in good faith what further mutually agreeable actions (if any)
will be taken with respect to such unobtained consent.

 



29 (d) If the assignment of a Lease, Contract or Surface Contract is subject to a
consent requirement other than Customary Post-Closing Consents and (i) the
holder of the consent right is a Governmental Authority, (ii) the Lease,
Contract or Surface Contract contains language to the effect that the
counterparty will have the right to terminate the Lease, Contract or Surface
Contract if an assignment is made without the consent requirement being
satisfied, (iii) the failure to obtain such consent would cause the assignment
to Buyer to be void or voidable, or (iv) the holder of such consent right has
denied such consent in writing (in such case, a " _Consent Agreement_ "), then
such Consent Agreement shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned and
sold to Buyer hereunder and the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the excluded Consent Agreement. Following the Closing,
Seller shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure such
consent within 180 Days following the Closing, with Buyer lending reasonable
assistance. If at the end of such 180-Day period the required consent has not
been obtained, then the Parties shall discuss in good faith what further
mutually agreeable actions (if any) will be taken with respect to
such Consent Agreement. If no further action is mutually agreed to between
the Parties within 60 Days (following such 180-Day period), the Consent
Agreement and any Assets related thereto shall be deemed an Excluded Asset. If
during such 180-Day period the required consent is obtained, then Seller
shall notify Buyer and Buyer shall purchase, on or before 10 Business Days
following receipt of such notice, the Consent Agreement under the terms of
this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Consent
Agreement. To the extent such Consent Agreement has not been included in
determining the Adjustments to be made pursuant to _Section 2.4_, then the
Adjustments that are specific to such Consent Agreement shall be calculated
and contemporaneous with the payment of such Allocated Value there shall be
applied as a deduction to such Allocated Value (if the sum of the downward
Adjustments exceeds the sum of the upward Adjustments) the net amount
resulting from such Adjustments or there shall be applied as an addition to
such Allocated Value (if the sum of the upward Adjustments exceeds the sum of
the downward Adjustments) the net amount resulting from such Adjustments.

 

7.3 _Approvals of Governmental Authorities_. Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or reasonably
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of all Governmental Authorities and officials and parties to contracts
with the Parties that may be or become necessary for the performance of
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will cooperate
fully with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders.

7.4 _Efforts_. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions and to do all things necessary to consummate, make effective and
comply with all of the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from time to time after Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further
instruments as may be reasonably requested by the other Party, at such
requesting Partys cost, and as are commercially reasonable to be performed in
order to accomplish more effectively the purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including those post-Closing

 



30  actions contemplated by _Section 7.2_. Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall:
(a) record the Assignment and all state and federal assignments executed at
the Closing in all applicable real property records and/or, if applicable,
all state and federal Governmental Authorities and Buyer shall provide to
Seller copies of such recorded documents; (b) actively pursue the approval of
all Customary Post-Closing Consents from the applicable Governmental
Authorities; and (c) except as otherwise provided for herein, actively pursue
all other consents and approvals that may be required in connection with the
assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of the rights,
interests, obligations and liabilities assumed by Buyer hereunder that have
not been obtained prior to Closing, provided that Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such other consents and approvals. Promptly
after Closing, Seller shall deliver all notices that are required to be
delivered in connection with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the
assumption of the rights, interests, obligations and liabilities assumed by
Buyer hereunder.

 

7.5 _Records in Seller s Possession_. Following Closing, Seller shall grant
Buyer reasonable access (at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice) to
the Records. Within 5 Business Days after the Closing Date, Seller shall

7.6 _SEC Matters_. Seller acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates may be
required to include statements of revenues and direct operating expenses and
other financial information relating to the Assets (" _Financial Statements_
") in documents filed with the SEC by Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and that such Financial Statements may be
required to be audited. In that regard, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer, and provide Buyer reasonable access to such records (to the extent such
information is available) and personnel of Seller as Buyer may reasonably
request to enable Buyer, and its representatives and accountants, at Buyers
sole cost and expense, to create and audit any Financial Statements that Buyer
deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Seller shall provide Buyer and its independent accountants with reasonable
access to any and all existing information, books, records, and documents in
Sellers possession that relate to the Assets (subject to any privilege or
confidentiality obligations) and other data delivered to Buyer by Seller
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement relevant to the periods being
audited.

under the terms of this Agreement occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall

TAXES

9.1 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees (a) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the acquired Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and
(b) in the case of Seller, to give the Buyer reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
Buyer so requests, Seller shall allow Buyer the option of taking possession
of such books and records prior to their disposal. Buyer and Seller further
agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated.

 

9.2 _Property and Excise Taxes_. All ad valorem, real property, personal
property, and similar Taxes assessed on the Assets (" _Property Taxes_ ") and
excise Taxes associated with any of the Assets (" _Excise Taxes_ ") are
Sellers obligation with respect to periods before the Effective Time and
Buyers obligation with respect to periods from and after the Effective Time;
provided that, if the taxable period with respect to such a Tax begins on or
before and ends after the Effective Time, then such Tax shall be attributable
to the portions of such taxable period before and after the Effective Time
based on the relative number days in each portion of such taxable period. If
either Party pays Property Taxes or Excise Taxes for which the other Party is
responsible, and the amount of such payment is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price under _Section 2.4_, then upon receipt
of evidence of payment the nonpaying Party will reimburse the paying Party
promptly for the nonpaying Partys share of such Taxes.

 

9.3 _Severance Taxes_. Seller shall bear and pay all severance or other Taxes
based upon or measured by Hydrocarbon production from the Assets, or the
receipt of proceeds therefrom, to the extent attributable to production from
the Assets before the Effective Time. Buyer shall bear and pay all such Taxes
on production from the Assets from and after the Effective Time. Seller
shall withhold and pay on behalf of Buyer all such Taxes on production from
the Assets between the Effective Time and the Closing Date, and the amount of
any such payment shall be reimbursed to Seller as an adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_. If either Party pays any such
Taxes owed by the other, and the amount of such payment is not taken into
account as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price under _Section 2.4_, then
upon receipt of evidence of payment the nonpaying Party will reimburse the
paying Party promptly for the nonpaying Partys share of such Taxes

 



33 9.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all state
and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes

contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith
