said adjustment. If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot resolve this matter
within five (5) business days, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section 1.4(d)._

(c) Within 30 days following the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and
deliver to the Purchaser a closing date balance sheet and a calculation of

Purchaser does not give the Seller notice of the Purchasers objection to the
Closing Statement, with such notice containing a statement of the basis of the
Purchasers objection, within 30 days of receipt of the Closing Statement,
then the Closing Statement shall be final for all purposes following the end
of such 30 day period.

(d) If the Purchaser shall have any objections to the Closing Statement
within 30 days following receipt of the Closing Statement, the Purchaser and
the Seller shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement as to the matter
in dispute. If the Purchaser and the Seller shall have failed to resolve such
disputed matter within ten business days (or such longer period as mutually
agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller) after receipt of written notice of
such objection, which notice shall contain a statement of the basis of the
disputing partys objection, then any such disputed matter may at any time
thereafter be referred by either party for resolution by a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm acceptable to the Seller and the
Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Purchaser and the
Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary to cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm
in its resolution of the dispute. The determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be made as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than 30 days following referral of the disputed matter to the Independent
Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
incurred in resolving the disputed matter shall be allocated equally between
the Purchaser and the Seller. The definitive Closing Statement and calculation
of Working Capital (the " _Certified Statement_ "), after resolution of any
disputes pursuant to this _Section 1.4_, shall be verified by the Independent
Accounting Firm in accordance with the requirements of this _Section 1.4_ and
shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto.

the Certified Statement or agreement between the Purchaser and the Seller on
the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)_ above, the Purchaser or
the Seller, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party an amount such
that following such payment, and taking into account the payments made on the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have paid to the Seller the Purchase Price,
plus (or minus) 100% of the amount by which the amount of Working Capital set
forth on the Certified Statement or on the Closing Statement exceeds (or is
less than) the Target Working Capital.

1.5 _Credits, Prorations and Prorated Credits_. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall prorate all Prepaids, including any payments due or advanced under any
lease (and all other similar customary adjustments, including Taxes), as of
the Closing Date. With respect to any amounts (including Taxes) that have not
yet been billed or otherwise determined, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
prorate such amounts based on the most recent ascertainable bill, based on
when such Taxes, Prepaids and other assessments are due and payable. The
Prepaids and such prorations (including Taxes) shall be included in the
calculation of Working Capital, to the extent assumed by the Purchaser.



 

\- 5 - 1.6 _Payments and Computations_. All payments under this Agreement shall be
made in U.S. dollars. Each party shall make any payment due to the other
party to this Agreement not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the

the Closing Date, and in the case of payments made pursuant to _Section
1.4(e)_, up to but excluding the date on which payment is received, and
otherwise, including the date on which payment is received). Whenever any
payment under this _Section 1.6_ shall be due on a day other than a business
day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day, and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of payment of interest.
Any payment as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section

Party) and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by
the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such suit or
proceeding and the amount of the claimed damages; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
Liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any Damage or
Liability caused by or arising out of such failure or to the extent such delay

and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the
defense of such suit or proceeding.

reasonably expects to incur Damages as a result of a breach of a
representation and warranty set forth herein, which notice shall describe such
breach and Damages in reasonable detail (an " _Expected Claim Notice_ "),
then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive until, but only

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party is actively pursuing the
resolution of such matter. If the legal proceeding with respect to which an
Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in

elected nonetheless to proceed with the Closing.

(v) Except as set forth in _Section 8.5(a)(iv)_, the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Seller Parties shall not be affected or deemed
waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser
(including any of the Purchasers Representations) or by reasons of any facts
or circumstances that the Purchaser or any of the Purchasers Representatives
should have known but did not actually know.

(b) _Other Benefits_. The amount of any and all Damages for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this _Article 8_ or _Article 9_
 shall be net of (i) any Tax benefit or Tax Attribute (net of any associated
Tax cost) to which an Indemnified Party is entitled by  



 

\- 33 -  reason of (A) payment by such Indemnified Party of such Damages, (B) the
receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder, or (C) any adjustment of
any Tax item which gives rise to any Damages and (ii) the amount of any
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments from third parties, contribution
payments or reimbursements actually received by the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Damages.

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for the remedy of specific performance prior to
the Closing or pursuant to  _Section 10.3(b)_ and except as otherwise
provided in _Article 9_ , the Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 8.1_
and _8.2_ shall, in the absence of fraud, be the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Seller and the Purchaser, respectively, for any breach of the
representations or warranties in this Agreement and for any failure to perform
or comply with any covenants or agreements contained herein. In furtherance
of, and subject to, the foregoing, each party hereto hereby waives, on behalf
of itself and, as applicable, the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against the Indemnifying Parties arising under or
based upon any applicable law (including Environmental laws) or otherwise
(except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
8_ ). 

8.7 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. In any case where an Indemnified
Party recovers from a third person any amount in respect of a matter for
which an Indemnifying Party has previously indemnified it pursuant to this
_Article 8_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom
the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in
excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party
to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any
amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim
arising out of such matter. Upon payment in full of any such amounts
recovered, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any person (other than
an Indemnified Party) with respect to the subject matter of such claim. Any
Indemnified Party shall assign or otherwise reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover amounts
from, any person liable or responsible for any Damages for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement. The obligations
of the Seller to indemnify and hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitees under
this _Article 8_ shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty
or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 8.4_. No Purchaser Indemnitee
shall have the right to assert any claim for indemnification against
the Seller unless such claim has been made with reasonable specificity
pursuant to _Section 8.3_ within the time periods provided in _Section 8.4_.
The obligations of the Purchaser to indemnify and hold harmless any
Seller Indemnitees under this _Article 8_ shall terminate when the applicable
representation, warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 8.4_. No
Seller Indemnitee shall have the right to assert any claim for
indemnification against the Purchaser unless such claim has been made with
reasonable specificity pursuant to _Section 8.3_ within the time periods
provided in _Section 8.4_.

8.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate their respective actual damages upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
actual Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder.



 

\- 34 - 8.9 _Characterization of Payments_. Except as otherwise required by applicable
law, the parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

8.10 _Exercise of Remedies by Purchaser Indemnitees Other than the
Purchaser_. No Purchaser Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor
or assignee of the Purchaser) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim
or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless the Purchaser (or
any successor or assignee of the Purchaser) consents to the assertion of the
indemnification claim or the exercise of the other remedy. No Purchaser
Indemnitee is entitled to assert any indemnification claim or exercise
any other remedy under this Agreement against any Affiliate of the Seller
Parties.

ARTICLE 9

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes_.

(a) The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser against all Damages for Taxes
assessed against the Purchaser with respect to the Business that are
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(b) The Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Parties and any of their
Affiliates against all Damages for Taxes assessed against the Seller Parties
that are attributable to the Purchasers conduct of the Business during any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

(c) With respect to any Straddle Period, any Damages for Taxes shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
by closing the books at the end of the Closing Date, except that Tax items of
a periodic nature, such as property taxes or depreciation allowances
calculated on an annual basis, shall be allocated by apportioning a pro-rata
portion of such Taxes to each day in the relevant Straddle Period.

(d) The Purchase Price shall be exclusive of any goods and services tax,
sales, use, value-added, transfer or similar Taxes (collectively, " _GST_ ").
The parties shall use their respective Best Efforts to satisfy the
requirements of the Singapore tax authorities so that the supply or transfer
of the Acquired Assets is regarded as a transfer of a business as a going
concern for purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A) (the " _GST
Act_ "), including without limitation each Party ensuring that it is a
registered taxable person for purposes of the GST Act and the Purchaser
providing written confirmations as required by any of the Seller Parties. The
parties shall use their respective Best Efforts to satisfy any similar
requirement of the Swiss tax authorities so that the supply or transfer of
the Acquired Assets is regarded as a transfer of a business as a going concern
for purposes of Swiss GST law. Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
conduct the Business as a going concern and the Acquired Assets will be
used for the purposes of the Business. In the event that it is determined
that any GST is payable for the supply or transfer of the Acquired Assets, the
relevant Seller Parties shall immediately issue a valid tax invoice for GST
purposes to the Purchaser, and after receipt of the valid tax invoice for GST
purposes the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller an amount equal to
such GST.



 

\- 35 - (e) The Purchaser shall be responsible for paying any stamp duty or stamp tax
required in connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets.

9.2 _Apportionment and Allocation of Purchase Price_. The total consideration
provided by the Purchaser, including the Purchase Price and the aggregate
amount of Assumed Liabilities, shall be apportioned among the Seller Parties
and Purchaser parties in accordance with _Schedule 9.2 (a)_ , and shall be
allocated among the Acquired Assets in accordance with _Schedule 9.2 (b)_.
For all tax and accounting purposes, each party to the transactions under this
Agreement shall report the effects of such transactions consistently with such
allocation.

9.3 _Cooperation_. Each of the Seller Parties and the Purchaser shall:

(a) Provide assistance to the other party as reasonably requested in preparing
and filing Tax Returns, including filing the necessary documents
in connection with the transfer of assets (reporting procedures), responding
to Tax Contests and recovering any GST;

(b) Make available to the other party as reasonably requested all
information, records and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Business;
and

(c) Retain any books and records that could reasonably be expected to be
necessary or useful in connection with any preparation by any other party of
any Tax Returns, for any audit, examination or proceeding relating to Taxes.
Such books and records shall be retained until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (including extensions thereof).

ARTICLE 10

OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Seller shall be
responsible for all obligations owed to the employees of the Business who are
employed by the Seller Parties as of the date hereof (the " _Active Employees_
") for all periods through the close of business on the Closing Date,
including all wages and other remuneration due to all Active Employees with
respect to their services as employees of the Seller Parties as of and through
the close of business on the Closing Date, including all vacation pay and
severance pay, if any, earned and payable through the Closing Date. 

(b) The Purchaser shall not assume, honor or accept any Employee Benefit Plan.
For all employees being transferred under article 333 CO, the Purchaser will
provide an employment benefit plan in accordance with their employment
agreements. The Seller shall be solely liable and responsible for satisfying
all obligations (whether arising under federal, state or local law, or
pursuant to contract or otherwise) that may arise or that may have arisen on
or before the Closing Date in connection with (i) the employment by the Seller
Parties of their respective employees (or the termination thereof), (ii) the
engagement of consultants, agents or other non-employee service providers,
(iii) the creation, funding or operation of any of the Seller Parties
respective Employee Benefit Plans that cover any of the Seller Parties  



 

\- 36 -  respective employees, consultants, agents or non-employee service providers,
or (iv) the transactions described in this Agreement, including but
not limited to compliance with the health care continuation requirements
under ERISA and the Code for current or former employees of the Seller Parties
(or their eligible dependents). At or prior to Closing, the Seller Parties
agree to pay to their employees amounts owing to such employees for the pro-
rata portion, if any, of amounts payable under any incentive program for the
portion of the current fiscal year ending on the Closing Date.

(c) The Purchaser shall offer to employ each of the Active Employees listed on
_Section 10.1(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules (each, upon acceptance of such
offer, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") either, in relation to employees covered
under the Employment Act of Singapore (the " _EA_ "), by way of transfer under
Section 18A of the EA, or pursuant to a new employment agreement, effective
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, at such employees salary,
annual leave and other terms and conditions substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such employee by the Seller as of the Closing
Date, including credit for prior years of service and applicable severance
benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall interview the
Level 1 Key Employees and Level 2 Key Employees within 15 business days after
the date of this Agreement, which interviews shall include a discussion of the
terms of employment with the Purchaser, and shall make offers to such
employees within 25 business days after the date of this Agreement. The Seller
Parties shall inform Active Employees covered by the CO according to article
333 et seq. CO, and such Active Employees who do not reject the transfer of
their working contract within allowed time shall become Continuing Employees
(because their employment agreement will be transferred at their terms and
conditions by operation of law in accordance with article 333 CO) and the
employment relationships with respect to the Continuing Employees are
transferred to the Purchaser including all rights and obligations as of the
date of the transfer and, as between Seller and Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
be responsible for all obligations owed to the Continuing Employees arising
after the Closing Date (close of business).

(d) The Purchaser shall have the right to offer to employ each of the
employees listed on _Section 10.1(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedules. If such
employees do not accept such offers of employment on or prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser the services previously
provided by such employees to the Seller, at the Purchasers sole cost and
expense, for a period of up to twelve months following the Closing Date.

(e) If, at any time within 12 months of the Closing Date, the Purchaser
makes an offer of employment to, and it is accepted by, any Active Employee
who is not a Continuing Employee, the Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the
Seller for any and all severance or termination payments that the Seller made
to such employee as a result of the action taken in contemplation of this
Agreement.

10.2 _Seller s Information_. In no event shall the Purchaser or any
Affiliate of the Purchaser involved in the operation of the Business hold
itself out as the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller after the Closing
Date; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 10.2_ shall restrict
the Purchasers use of the names "Muller Feindraht AG," "American Fine Wire"
or any derivations thereof. In addition, the Purchaser shall, within three (3)
months of the Closing Date, re-label, at the Purchasers sole expense, or
discard all marketing documentation acquired pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)(i)_
bearing the name "Kulicke and Soffa," "KandS" or any derivation thereof.



 

\- 37 - 10.3 _Certain Covenants_.

(a) _Nonsolicitation_.

(i) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Seller or as otherwise
permitted in the Sales Representative Agreement, for a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Nonsolicitation Period_ "), the Purchaser shall not, directly or
indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person
nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, call upon any person who is, at the time the person
is called upon, an employee of the Seller Parties or any Affiliate of the
Seller Parties, for the purpose or with the intent of soliciting such employee
away from or out of the employ of the Seller, or employ or offer employment
to any person who was or is employed by the Seller unless such person shall
have ceased to be employed by the Seller for a period of at least six months.

(ii) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Purchaser or as otherwise
permitted in the Sales Representative Agreement, during the Nonsolicitation
Period, the Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf
of or in conjunction with any other person, nor shall it permit any of its
subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
call upon any Continuing Employee or any person who is, at the time the
person is called upon, an employee of the Purchaser for the purpose or with
the intent of soliciting such employee away from or out of the employ of the
Purchaser, or employ or offer employment to any person who was or is employed
by the Purchaser unless such person shall have ceased to be employed by the
Purchaser for a period of at least six months.

(iii) This _Section 10.3_ shall not be deemed to prohibit the Purchaser or
the Seller from engaging in general media advertising or solicitation that
may be targeted to a particular geographic or technical area but that is not
targeted towards current employees of the Seller (in the case of the Purchaser
) or the Purchaser (in the case of the Seller).

(iv) For purposes of this _Section 10.3_, references to the "Seller" or the
"Seller Parties" includes the Seller and the Seller Parties, as the case may
be, and each of its subsidiaries, and references to the "Purchaser" include
each subsidiary of the Purchaser.

(b) _Noncompetition_.

(i) For a period of five years after the Closing, the Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates to not, engage, directly or indirectly, whether as
an officer, director, employee, consultant, owner, member, manager, partner,
 



 

\- 38 -  shareholder, advisor, consultant or otherwise in any business that competes
anywhere in the world with the Business as conducted on the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, manufacturing or distributing any
products in competition with the Business (the " _Restricted Business_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
restrict (i) any activities expressly permitted under the Joint Development
and Engineering Services Agreement, the Sales Representative Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, or (ii) any acquisition of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates by any person, including by means of a business combination,
merger, consolidation, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities,
tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise, in which a person or "group" (as
defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
promulgated thereunder) of persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial
or record ownership or voting power of securities representing more than 50%
of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the Seller
or its Affiliates or in which such transaction constitutes or accounts for 50%
or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of such
acquiring person.

(ii) In addition to the foregoing, for a period of five years after the
Closing, the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not, acquire
(whether by acquisition of assets, merger or otherwise) any Business Entity
for whom revenues from the Restricted Business represented an amount greater
than 5% of such entitys aggregate revenues during such entitys last fiscal
year, or is reasonably projected to represent an amount greater than 5% of
such entitys aggregate projected revenues during such entitys next fiscal
year (a " _Relevant Acquisition_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Seller or its Affiliates may make a Relevant Acquisition if within nine months
of the consummation of such Relevant Acquisition, the Seller or its Affiliate
has disposed of (or ceased operating) that portion of the Business Entity
conducting the Restricted Business.

(iii) If any provision contained in this _Section 10.3(b)_ shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this _Section 10.3(b)_, but this _Section 10.3(b)_ shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by applicable law, or in
any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision
shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this _Section
10.3(b)_ to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic
area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained
herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable law. The
Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that the other could be irreparably
harmed by any breach of this _Section 10.3(b)_ and that there would be
no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate the Purchaser or the
Seller, as applicable, for any such breach. The Seller or the Purchaser, as
applicable, agrees that the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek injunctive
relief requiring specific performance by the other party of this _Section
10.3(b)_.



 

\- 39 - 10.4 _Wrong Pocket_.

(a) If the Seller Parties receive any payment (i) in respect of any Accounts
Receivable included in the Acquired Assets or (ii) for any product or service
sold by or on behalf of Purchaser after the Closing, the Seller Parties shall
promptly remit such funds to the Purchaser.

(b) If the Purchaser receives any payment for any product or service sold by
or on behalf of the Seller Parties after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
promptly remit such funds to the Seller.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, if any party receives a payment from a
third party that, pursuant to the terms hereof, should have been paid to the
other party hereto, the party who receives the payment agrees to hold in trust
and promptly remit such payment to the party entitled thereto. If either
party receives a payment from a customer that cannot be identified to a
specific invoice or obligation, the recipient shall, if reasonable under the
circumstances, inquire of the customer as to the intended application thereof
and, lacking a response, the payment shall be applied to the oldest
outstanding undisputed invoice relating to the payor.

10.5 _Accounts Receivable_.

(a) The Purchaser shall use its Best Efforts to collect the
Accounts Receivable included in the Acquired Assets for the 120 calendar day
period immediately following the Closing Date (" _Accounts Receivable
Collection Period_ "). Within ten (10) business days following the end of the
Accounts Receivable Collection Period, the Purchaser shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a report (the " _Accounts Receivable
Report_ ") setting forth the amount of such Accounts Receivable that has not
been collected by the Purchaser by the end of the Accounts Receivable
Collection Period, net of the reserves that have been provided for Accounts
Receivable in the Closing Statement (the " _Uncollected Accounts Receivable_
").

(b) The Seller shall have ten (10) business days from the receipt of the
Accounts Receivable Report to review the same (the " _Accounts Receivable
Review Period_ "). For the purpose of such review, the Purchaser shall afford
the Seller or its accountants and Representatives the right to inspect the
Purchasers records related to the Accounts Receivable. In the event
the Seller disputes the Uncollected Accounts Receivable, the Seller shall
provide written notice to the Purchaser within the Accounts Receivable Review
Period, setting forth the basis of such dispute (the " _Accounts Receivable
Dispute Notice_ "). If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot resolve such
dispute, if any, within five (5) business days after the end of the Accounts
Receivable Review Period, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to _Section
1.4(d)_. If the Seller does not give the Purchaser the Accounts Receivable
Dispute Notice within ten (10) business days of receipt of the Accounts
Receivable Report, then the Accounts Receivable Report and the Uncollected
Accounts Receivable shall be final for all purposes.



 

\- 40 - (c) Within fifteen (15) business days after delivery of the Accounts
Receivables Report or, in the event of a dispute, within five (5) business
days after the resolution of the dispute by mutual agreement of the Seller and
the Purchaser or the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm, as
applicable, the Purchaser shall transfer the Uncollected Accounts Receivable
to the Seller and the Seller shall transfer to the Purchaser, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the amount of such
Uncollected Accounts Receivable, net of reserves that have been provided for
Accounts Receivable in the Closing Statement, together with interest thereon
from the Closing Date to the date of the payment at the three-month London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as reported on the Closing Date in _The Wall
Street Journal_. If any Accounts Receivable that are transferred to the
Seller are subsequently collected by the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
promptly remit such amounts to the Seller.

10.6 _Name Change_. After the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall refrain
from using the names "Muller Feindraht AG" and the "American Fine Wire" and,
within ten (10) business days after the Closing Date, Muller shall take all
necessary corporate action to effect a change of its corporate name to a name
other than "Muller Feindraht AG" or any derivation thereof.

10.7 _Redirection of Email, Website and Documents_. Following the Closing
Date, the Seller Parties and the Purchaser shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to redirect to (i) the Purchaser all email
correspondence, website traffic, contracts, production orders and other
similar items that the Seller Parties receive related to the Business (ii)
the Seller Parties all email correspondence, website traffic, contracts,
production orders and other similar items that the Purchaser receives that are
not related to the Business.

writing signed by the party intended to be bound by the waiver. A party is
not prevented from enforcing

or delay in exercising any right or remedy or in requiring satisfaction
of any condition, except to the extent that the party specifically waives the
same in writing. A written waiver given for one matter or occasion is
effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once
given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other matter or occasion.

intended to be exclusive, and a partys rights and remedies are intended to be
cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any rights and remedies
authorized in law or in equity.
