each Company Share subject to a Company Restricted Share Award, that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and converted into, and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, the following consideration, in each case, without interest:

(i) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only cash
(a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant
to Section 2.03 (each, a "Cash Electing Company Share") shall be converted
into the right to receive $9.50 in cash.

(ii) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive a
combination of Parent Shares and CVR consideration (a "Share and CVR Election")
has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.03
(each, a "Share and CVR Electing Company Share") and each Non-Electing Company
Share shall be converted into the right to receive the combination of (1)
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07, 0.743 of a share of
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Shares
(such fraction of a Parent Share, the "Share and CVR Election Exchange Ratio")
and (2) one (1) contractual contingent value right (each, a "CVR"), which shall represent the right to receive a contingent cash
payment as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Contingent Value Rights Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C, but subject to the review and comment of the

combination of cash, Parent Shares, Merger Consideration Preference Shares,
Merger Consideration Warrants and Upside Rights (a "Mixed Election") has been
effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be
converted into the right to receive the combination of (1) $0.905 in cash, (2)
a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
Parent Shares, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07, equal to
the Mixed Election Common Shares Exchange Ratio, (3) subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.07, a number of duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable Series A preference shares, par value $0.10 per
share, of Parent (the "Merger Consideration Preference Shares"), having the
terms and conditions set forth in the certificate of designation of Parent
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Parent
Certificate of Designation") equal to the Mixed Election Preference Shares
Exchange Ratio, (4) subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07,
0.190 of a warrant (each, a "Merger Consideration Warrant") in the form of and
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrant
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, but subject
to the review and comment of the Paying Agent (the "Parent Warrant Agreement")
to be entered into by and between Parent and the Paying Agent and (5) $0.905
aggregate principal amount of a right issued by Parent (collectively, the
"Upside Rights") in the form of and subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the form of Upside Right (the "Upside Right
Instrument") substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, but
subject to the review and comment of the Rights Agent; provided that an Upside
Right may be issued in an applicable aggregate principal amount to any holder
of Company Shares making a Mixed Election.

(b) The consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.01(c), together with
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares and Merger Consideration Preference
Shares, as the case may be, as contemplated by Section 2.2(e), is collectively
referred to herein, as the "Merger Consideration."

(c) Subject to Section 2.06, as of the Effective Time, all Company Shares
shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Company Shares (each, a "Certificate") or uncertificated Company Shares
represented by book entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Book-Entry Share") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to
be paid in consideration therefor, in accordance with Section 2.02(b), and the
right to receive dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section
2.02(f), in each case, without interest.

Section ii.. Exchange Fund.

(1) Paying Agent. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") in connection
with the payment and delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Article II and, in
connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent on
or prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent (i) a number of Parent Shares represented by
book entry sufficient to pay the full number of Parent Shares issuable
pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding Company Shares based on a
good faith estimate thereof, (ii) a number of Merger Consideration Preference
Shares represented by book entry sufficient to pay the full number of Merger
Consideration Preference Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange
for outstanding Company Shares based on a good faith estimate thereof, (iii) a
number of Merger Consideration Warrants represented by book entry sufficient
to pay the full number of Merger Consideration Warrants issuable pursuant to
Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding Company Shares based on a good faith
estimate thereof and (iv) an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
cash portion of the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Shares,
assuming that there will not be any fractional Parent Shares or Merger
Consideration Preference Shares (such shares, warrants and cash described in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), and the shares, warrants and cash
referred to in the following two sentences, being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund"). From time to time as necessary, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, additional cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent
Shares and Merger Consideration Preference Shares to holders of Company Shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions payable
to holders of Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and Section 2.02(h).
In the event that the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to make
the payments contemplated by this Section 2.02, Parent shall promptly deposit,
or cause to be deposited, additional cash, Parent Shares, Merger Consideration
Preference Shares and Merger Consideration Warrants with the Paying Agent in
an amount sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall be held in
trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares
that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Pending its
disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.02, any cash included in the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in
(A) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (B) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (C)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (D)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion; provided that no
investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Company
or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article
II, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent, to be held in trust by the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same
manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments
contemplated by this Article II. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the
rights of any former holder of Company Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than the payment to holders of Company Shares of the Merger
Consideration and of any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and Section 2.02(h).

(2) Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Company Shares. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Company
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement (other than a holder of Dissenting Shares or any
holder of a Certificate who properly made and did not revoke a Mixed Election,
a Cash Election or a Share and CVR Election) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall (i) specify that delivery of a Certificate shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to such Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Certificate to the Paying Agent and (ii) be in such form and have such
other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to
the Company's reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to the Effective
Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth, among other things,
the procedures by which holders of Certificates may effect the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to this
Article II. Each holder of a Certificate who properly made and did not revoke
a Mixed Election, a Cash Election or a Share and CVR Election pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(c) for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares or Merger Consideration Preference Shares, as the
case may be, as set forth in Section 2.2(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(c))
representing Non-Electing Company Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole Parent Shares
(which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) and CVRs which the
aggregate number of Company Shares previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) into the right to
receive and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares as set forth in Section
2.2(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
payment in the form of or with respect to CVRs, Merger Consideration
Preference Shares, Merger Consideration Warrants or Upside Rights) is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be accompanied by all documents evidencing transfer to such Person and
(y) the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company that any transfer, stamp or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder either has been
paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant hereto. In lieu
thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall
automatically, upon the delivery of a Form of Election (and, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares held via a depository, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of
any customary transmission or materials required by the Paying Agent), be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Company Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
satisfaction of the applicable procedures contemplated by this Section 2.02
and subject to Section 2.06, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions
pertaining to Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share as contemplated by Section 2.02(f). No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the cash payable with respect to Company Shares pursuant to
this Article II. For Federal, State and local income Tax purposes, Parent
shall be treated as owning the Exchange Fund and all income and loss related
thereto, and no party shall file any tax return inconsistent with such
treatment, unless otherwise required by a determination (as defined in Section
1313 of the Code) and any other applicable State and local tax Law.

(3) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent or the
Surviving Company shall pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to be paid in respect
of Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated by
this Article II.

(4) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been delivered to the Paying
Agent and which has not been disbursed to former holders of Company Shares,
and thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent
and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims of the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions pertaining to their former Company Shares
that such former holders have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.02(f). Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(5) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, no fraction of a Parent Share or Merger Consideration Preference
Share may be issued in connection with the Merger and no dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Shares or Merger Consideration Preference
Shares shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share and no
such fractional share will entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a shareholder of Parent or the Surviving Company. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional Parent Share or Merger Consideration Preference Share,
as the case may be, any holder of Company Shares or Company Awards who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share or Merger
Consideration Preference Share shall be paid cash, without interest, in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the fractional interest in a Parent Share
or Merger Consideration Preference Share, as the case may be, to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled under this Article II but for this Section
2.02(e) multiplied by (ii) the applicable Measurement Price.

(6) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to any Parent Shares that the holder thereof has
the right to receive upon the surrender thereof until the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Certificate, or (in the
case of a Book-Entry Share) deliver a Form of Election (and, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares held via a depository, the Paying Agent shall have received
any customary transmission or materials required by the Paying Agent), in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to any applicable state, federal or
other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as
the case may be, in addition to all other amounts to which such holder is
entitled under this Article II, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to the number of Parent Shares that such holder is
entitled to pursuant to this Article II (rounded down to the nearest whole
Parent Share) with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with
respect to Parent Shares prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or delivery, as the
case may be, and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or delivery, as
the case may be, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Shares
that such holder is entitled to pursuant to this Article II.

(7) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares, Merger
Consideration Preference Shares, Merger Consideration Warrants, CVRs (or, in
each case, dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund or provided by the Rights Agent, as applicable, to the extent delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or
other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(8) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid and any payments, if any, made pursuant to Section 2.02(f)
in respect of each Company Share in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to (i) Section 2.06 and (ii) the
Surviving Company's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared by the Company on Company Shares not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company
of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company
Shares formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(d), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article II.

(9) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and the
Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement and any
Redemption Price under Section 2.04 such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or under any
provision of other applicable Tax Law. Parent shall notify the Company at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing (or, if such time is
unreasonable under the circumstances, as soon as practicable thereafter) of
any Tax that Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent intends to withhold.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to reduce or eliminate any
withholding tax, and shall each provide to the other party any forms it is
eligible to provide to reduce or eliminate such withholding tax. To the extent
amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent,
Parent shall promptly remit (or cause to be remitted) such deduction or
withholding to the appropriate Governmental Authority and shall promptly
provide the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
with the appropriate documentation for such payments. To the extent amounts of
Tax are deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section iii.. Company Election Procedures.

(1) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder
of Company Shares (which shall include, for purposes of this Section 2.03 and
as contemplated by Section 2.04(b), any holder of Private Warrants who shall exercise such
Private Warrants for Company Shares), other than Dissenting Shares and Company
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), shall be entitled
to specify the number of such holder's Company Shares with respect to which
such holder makes a Cash Election, a Share and CVR Election or a Mixed Election
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(2) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the registration statement
on Form S-4 pursuant to which each of the Parent Shares, CVRs, Merger
Consideration Preference Shares, Merger Consideration Warrants and Upside
Rights issued as the Merger Share Consideration will be registered under the
Securities Act (the "Registration Statement") a form of election (the "Form of
Election") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The
Form of Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Form of Election and any Certificates to the Paying Agent. The Company
shall mail the Form of Election with the proxy statement relating to the
Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, together with the proxy
statement relating to the Parent Shareholders Meeting, in each case as amended
or supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement") to all Persons
who are record holders of Company Shares as of the record date for the Company
Shareholders Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder
of Company Shares (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial
owner through proper instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election,
a Share and CVR Election or a Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails
to make a Cash Election, a Share and CVR Election or a Mixed Election with
respect to any Company Shares held or beneficially owned by such holder by the
Election Deadline, then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Share and CVR
Election with respect to those Company Shares (each such Company Share, a
"Non-Electing Company Share"). The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons who become
record holders of Company Shares during the period between the record date for
the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Election Deadline.

(3) Any such holder's election shall have been properly made only if the
Paying Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m.,
Bermuda time, on the date that is ten (10) Business Days preceding the Closing
Date (the "Election Deadline"), a Form of Election properly completed and
signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates representing the Company Shares
represented by Certificates to which such Form of Election relates, duly
endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of
the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates
as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible
guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act))
provided that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Paying Agent by
the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, any documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form
of Election. After a Cash Election, a Share and CVR Election or a Mixed Election
is validly made with respect to any Company Shares, no further registration of
transfers of such Company Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of
the Company, unless and until such Cash Election, Share and CVR Election or
Mixed Election is properly revoked. (4) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, announce any such delay
and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(5) Any Cash Election, Share and CVR Election or Mixed Election may be revoked
with respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject thereto by the
holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice
received by the Paying Agent prior to the Election Deadline. All Cash
Elections, Share and CVR Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be
revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII. If a
Cash Election or Mixed Election is revoked, the Company Shares as to which
such election previously applied shall be treated as Share and CVR Electing
Shares in accordance with Section 2.01(c)(i)(B) unless a contrary election is
submitted by the holder prior to the Election Deadline. Certificates will not
be returned to holders unless the holder so requests.

(6) The determination of the Paying Agent (or the joint determination of
Parent and the Company, in the event that the Paying Agent declines to make
any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not
Cash Elections, Share and CVR Elections or Mixed Elections shall have been
properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.03 and as to when Cash
Elections, Share and CVR Elections, Mixed Elections and revocations were
received by the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent (or Parent and the Company
jointly, in the event that the Paying Agent declines to make the following
computation) shall also make all computations contemplated by Section 2.01(c),
and absent manifest error, such computation shall be conclusive and binding.
The Paying Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent (subject to the
consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any rules as are consistent with this Section 2.03 for the
implementation of the Cash Elections, Share and CVR Elections and Mixed
Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to
effect these Cash Elections, Share and CVR Elections and Mixed Elections.

Section iv.. Redemption of Company Preference Shares; Treatment of Warrants.

(1) At the Closing, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to each of the
holders of Company Preference Shares, by wire transfer of same-day funds, the
Redemption Price (as such term is defined in the Company Certificate of
Designation) to which such holder is entitled in accordance with the Company
Certificate of Designation. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide for the redemption of the Company Preference Shares at the Closing,
including delivering a Redemption Notice (as such term is defined in the
Company Certificate of Designation) at least twenty (20) calendar days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date in accordance with the Company Certificate of
Designation.

(2) At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Private Warrants or the Public Warrants, as applicable, (collectively, the
"Company Warrants"), automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, the Company Warrants shall be converted into the right to
purchase and receive upon exercise thereof, upon the basis and upon the terms
and conditions specified in such Company Warrant and in lieu of the Company Shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the
exercise of the rights represented thereby, (i) in the case of a Public
Warrant, the Merger Consideration that the holder of such Public Warrant is
entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of such Public Warrant, if any, or
(ii) in the case of a Private Warrant, the Merger Consideration that the
holder of such Private Warrant would have received if such holder had
exercised such Private Warrant immediately prior to the Closing, and each
holder of Private Warrants shall be entitled to deliver a Form of Election in
respect of the Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive, if
any, in accordance with Section 2.03 as if such holder was a holder of a
corresponding number of Company Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume, by written instrument, all of the Company's obligations under
the terms of the Private Warrants in respect of the rights of the holders
thereof to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in the foregoing
clause (ii) of this Section 2.04(b).

Section v.. Company Equity Awards.

(1) Company Options. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire Company Shares
and shall be converted at the Effective Time, without any action on the part
of any holder of any Company Option, into a right and option to acquire Parent
Shares (each, an "Assumed Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option (including applicable vesting, exercise
and expiration provisions and any terms and conditions relating to accelerated
vesting upon a termination of the holder's employment in connection with or
following the Merger). The number of Parent Shares subject to each such
Company Option shall be equal to the number of Company Shares subject to each
such Company Option multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07), rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Shares, and such Parent Option shall have an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in such Company Option divided by the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07); provided that
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, exercise price, number of Parent Shares
subject to such Assumed Option, and terms and conditions of exercise of each
such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code.

(2) Company RSU Awards. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award
(each, an "Assumed RSU Award") relating to (and that is settled by the
delivery of) a number of Parent Shares equal to the number of Company Shares
underlying the Company RSU Award multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.07), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares. Each Assumed RSU Award shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting upon a termination of the holder's employment in
connection with or following the Merger).

(3) Reservation of Shares. To the extent necessary to give effect to this
Section 2.05, not later than the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for
future issuance under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan a number of Parent
Shares at least equal to the number of Parent Shares that will be subject to
the Assumed Options, the Assumed RSU Awards and the CVR Restricted Shares as a
result of the actions contemplated by this Section 2.05 and the Waiver
Agreements entered into as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Not
later than the Effective Time, Parent shall file an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the Parent
Shares subject to such Assumed Options, Assumed RSU Awards and CVR Restricted
Shares and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and Parent
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements for so long as such Assumed Options, Assumed RSU
Awards and CVR Restricted Shares remain outstanding.

(4) Actions of Company and Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or applicable committee thereof) shall and the Parent Board (or
applicable committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. Without
limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, not later than
thirty (30) days following the date hereof, (i) the Company Board (or
applicable committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to
give effect to the treatment of Company Performance Share Awards and Company
LTIP Awards set forth on Section 2.05(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(ii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries who hold Company Performance Share Awards
or Company LTIP Awards to execute an agreement, in the form prescribed by the
Company, to give effect to such treatment and (iii) the Company shall request
that, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 2.05(d)(ii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter to execute the Waiver Agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I.

Section vi.. Shares of Dissenting Holders.

(1) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
canceled and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the "Appraised Fair Value") is greater
than the Merger Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from the
Surviving Company by payment in cash made within thirty (30) days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure.

(2) In the event that a holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an "Appraisal Withdrawal"),
such holder's Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Electing Company
Shares that have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and be deemed
to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c)(i)(A), without
interest and subject to any required withholding of Taxes.

(3) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares or Appraisal
Withdrawals and any other written instruments, notices, petitions or other
communications received by the Company in connection with the foregoing, in
each case, pursuant to the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act concerning
the rights of holders of Company Shares to require appraisal of such Company
Shares in accordance with this Section 2.06 and (B) to the extent that the
Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act, and the Company shall
consider in good faith any requests made by Parent in connection therewith.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or applications or take any other action to exercise appraisal
rights in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act. Payment of any amount
payable to holders of Dissenting Shares shall be the obligation of the
Surviving Company.

Section vii.. Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration, the Share and CVR Exchange Ratio, the
Mixed Election Exchange Ratio, the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Article III.



Representations and Warranties of the Company

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
(A) set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure letter delivered
by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") or (B) disclosed or reserved for in any Company
SEC Documents filed prior to the third Business Day prior to the date hereof
(other than disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections of any such filings and
any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer contained in any such filings and any other disclosures in any such
filings that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature (it being
agreed and understood that any matter disclosed in such Company SEC Documents
shall not be deemed disclosed for purposes of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.14
and 3.21)):

Section i.. Organization; Standing. (1) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other
legal entity, duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, (ii) has full
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties, rights and assets and to conduct its business as presently
conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in each case of clause
(iii), where such failure would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(2) A true and correct copy of each of the Company Organizational Documents is
included in the Company SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of any
provisions of the Company Organizational Documents. The Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of the organizational documents of
each Subsidiary of the Company that conducts the business of insurance or
reinsurance or is licensed as a Lloyd's corporate member or Lloyd's managing
agent (each, a "Company Insurance Subsidiary"), in each case, as amended and
in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

Section ii.. Capitalization.

(1) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 500,000,000
Company Shares and 100,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company. At the close of business on August 3, 2020 (the "Company
Capitalization Date"), (i) 115,299,341 Company Shares were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 11,901,670 Company Preference Shares were issued and
outstanding, (iii) 6,088,535 Public Warrants were issued and outstanding, (iv)
5,418,434 Private Warrants were issued and outstanding, and (v) zero Company
Shares were held by the Company as treasury shares. Since the Company
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, other than in
connection with the vesting or settlement of Company Awards, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any Company Shares or any
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Company Shares. All of the issued and outstanding Company Shares and Company
Preference Shares and the Public Warrants and the Private Warrants have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and
were issued in compliance with all applicable securities Laws.

(2) As of the close of business on the Company Capitalization Date, the
Company had no Company Shares or Company Preference Shares reserved for
issuance, except for 13,940,688 Company Shares reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Company Share Plans (including 4,416,553 Company Shares subject to
outstanding Company Awards at target), 6,088,535 Company Shares reserved for
issuance pursuant to the Public Warrants, 5,418,434 Company Shares reserved
for issuance pursuant to the Private Warrants and 15,000,000 Company Shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to the terms of the Company Preference Shares.

(3) Section 3.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
correct list as of the Company Capitalization Date of outstanding Company
Awards, including for each such award (as applicable) the holder (the specific identity of whom may be
redacted to the extent required by applicable Law), type of award, the number
of Company Shares subject to each award (for the avoidance of doubt, for
performance-based awards, the target number of Company Shares is the number at
target level of performance), the applicable Company Share Plan under which
such awards were granted, grant date, vesting schedule, expiration date,
exercise price and performance period. There are no outstanding compensatory
share options, restricted shares, restricted share units or other equity-
related securities or awards other than the Company Awards. No Company Option
is an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 421 of the Code.

(4) Except as set forth in Section 3.02(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter:
as of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Company Shares, Company Preference Shares or Company
Rights or to pay any dividend or make any other distribution in respect
thereof, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no such obligations have been
asserted by any holders of Company Shares, Company Preference Shares or
Company Rights. All dividends required to be paid in respect of the Company
Preference Shares have been timely paid and there are no accrued and unpaid
dividends with respect to the Company Preference Shares. There are no voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party
with respect to the voting of shares of the Company. There are no preemptive
or similar rights granted by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company on
the part of any holders of any class of securities of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth above in Section 3.02(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, other than the outstanding Company Awards and the
outstanding Company Warrants, there are not any options, warrants, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock units, stock-based performance units,
commitments, contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries of the Company is a party or by which any
of them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, deliver or sell or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of, or
other equity interest in, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)

Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and designed as necessary to
permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's

procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Parent's financial statements
in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
Parent and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parent's assets
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. Parent, based

this Agreement and the discussions, negotiations and transactions related

Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened or anticipated claims, actions, suits, investigations, audits or
examinations with respect to any Parent Plan or its assets (other than routine
claims for benefits).

(3) Parent does not maintain or contribute to a plan subject to Title IV of

service provider of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
other payment or benefit under any Parent Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of compensation or benefits, or increase the amount of
compensation due to any director, officer, employee or individual service
provider of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (whether by virtue of any
termination, severance, change of control or similar benefit or otherwise),
(iii) cause Parent to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any benefits
under any Parent Plan, (iv) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness, trigger
any funding obligation under any Parent Plan or impose any restrictions or
limitations on Parent's rights to administer, amend or terminate any Parent
Plan or (v) result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting
of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation section 1.280G-1) that would reasonably be construed,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, to constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
Person is entitled to receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-
up, indemnification or other payment) from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries

Insurance Laws, have been filed with and not objected to by such authority
within the period provided for objection, except that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(4) The Parent Insurance Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, their
respective agents and administrators that wrote, sold, produced, managed or
marketed the Parent Insurance Policies for any of the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries, have issued, sold, produced, managed and marketed such Parent
Insurance Policies in compliance with applicable Law in the respective
jurisdictions in which such products have been sold, except such non-
compliance as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, each
agent or administrator (i) was duly licensed as required by Law in the
particular jurisdiction in which such agent or administrator wrote, sold,
produced, managed or marketed the Parent Insurance Policies (for the type of
business wrote, sold, produced, managed or marketed on behalf of the Parent
Insurance Subsidiary) except for such failures to be licensed which have been
cured, which have been resolved or settled through agreements with applicable
Governmental Authorities, which are barred by an applicable statute of
limitations and which have not had and would not reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
if required by applicable Law, was duly appointed by the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary, except such omissions as have not had and would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(1) Except for any failure to file or submit the same that has been cured or
resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable Insurance Regulator, since
January 1, 2019, each of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries has filed or

each case, required by applicable Insurance Law to be filed with or submitted
to the appropriate Insurance Regulator of each jurisdiction in which it is
licensed, authorized or otherwise eligible with respect to the conduct of the
business of insurance or reinsurance, as applicable (collectively, the "Parent
Statutory Statements"), except for such failures to file which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(2) Parent has made available to the Company, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and to the extent required to be filed with the applicable
Insurance Regulator on or prior to the date of this Agreement, true and
correct copies of all material (i) Parent Statutory Statements as of December

the form filed with the applicable Insurance Regulator and (ii) examination
reports of any insurance regulatory authorities received by Parent relating to
the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries since January 1, 2019. The financial
statements included in such Parent Statutory Statements were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with Applicable SAP, applied on a consistent
basis, except as may have been noted therein, during the periods involved, and
fairly present in all material respects, to the extent required by and in
conformity with Applicable SAP, the statutory financial position of the
relevant Parent Insurance Subsidiary as of the respective dates thereof and
the results of operations of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary for the
respective periods then ended, and no material deficiency has been asserted in
writing by any Insurance Regulator with respect to any of such Parent
Statutory Statements that has not been cured or otherwise resolved prior to
the date hereof. Except as indicated therein, (x) all assets that are
reflected on the Parent Statutory Statements comply with all applicable
Insurance Laws regulating the investments of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries
and (y) all applicable Insurance Laws with respect to admitted assets and are
in amount at least equal to the minimum amount required by applicable
Insurance Laws except, in the case of clauses (x) and (y), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. The financial statements included in the Parent
Statutory Statements accurately reflect in all material respects the extent to
which, under applicable Law and Applicable SAP, the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary is entitled to take credit for reinsurance (or any local
equivalent concept).

(3) Since January 1, 2019, no material fine or penalty has been imposed on any
Parent Insurance Subsidiary by any Insurance Regulator. Since January 1, 2019,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material adverse
remarks, comments or responses on any of the reporting, visits, reviews,
questionnaires or surveys, or any other matter from the relevant Insurance
Regulator.

Section xviii.. Reinsurance.

(1) As of the date of this Agreement, each reinsurance or retrocession treaty
or agreement, slip, binder, cover note or other similar arrangement pursuant
to which any Parent Insurance Subsidiary is the cedent or reinsurer (the
"Parent Reinsurance Contracts") is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the applicable Parent Insurance Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
each other party thereto, and is enforceable against the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto, in accordance with its terms (except in each case as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither the applicable
Parent Insurance Subsidiary nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties to any Parent Reinsurance Contract is in material default or material
breach or has failed to perform any material obligation under any such Parent
Reinsurance Contract, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there does not exist
any event, condition or omission that would constitute such a material breach
or material default (whether by lapse of time or notice or both), except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries has
received written notice of the existence of any event or condition which
constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
default on the part of such Parent Insurance Subsidiary under any Parent
Reinsurance Contract, except where such default would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened Actions with
respect to any material Parent Reinsurance Contract.

(2) To the Knowledge of Parent, (i) no party to a Parent Reinsurance Contract
is insolvent or the subject of a rehabilitation, liquidation, conservatorship,
receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, (ii) there are no, and since
January 1, 2019 there have been no, disputes under any Parent Reinsurance
Contract other than disputes in the ordinary course of business for which
adequate loss reserves have been established and (iii) the applicable Parent
Insurance Subsidiary is entitled to take credit for reinsurance in the Parent
Statutory Statements for all such Parent Reinsurance Contracts with respect to
which credit for reinsurance is available and all such amounts recoverable,
receivable or payable have been properly recorded in the books and records of
account (if so accounted therefor) of the applicable Parent Insurance
Subsidiary and are properly reflected in the Parent Statutory Statements and
in Parent's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP except, in
each of clauses (i) through (iii), as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(3) With respect to any Parent Reinsurance Contract for which any Parent
Insurance Subsidiary is taking credit on its most recent Parent Statutory
Statements, from and after January 1, 2019: (i) there has been no separate
written or oral agreement between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and the
assuming reinsurer that would adversely reduce, limit, mitigate or otherwise
affect any actual or potential loss to the applicable Parent Insurance
Subsidiary that is a party thereto under any such Parent Reinsurance Contract,
other than inuring contracts that are explicitly defined in any such Parent
Reinsurance Contract; and (ii) the Parent Insurance Subsidiary party thereto
complies, and has complied with any applicable requirements set forth in
Applicable SAP, except, in each of clauses (i) through (ii), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section xix.. Reserves. The statutory policy reserves with respect to the
Parent Insurance Policies (the "Parent Reserves") of each Parent Insurance
Subsidiary contained in the Parent Statutory Statements (a) were, except as
otherwise noted in the applicable Parent Statutory Statement, determined in
all material respects in accordance with Applicable SAP and (b) satisfied the
requirements of Applicable SAP and all applicable Law in all material
respects, except as otherwise noted in such statutory statements and notes thereto
included in such statutory statements. Parent has made available to the
Company a true and correct copy of all material actuarial analyses of Parent
and its Subsidiaries that were prepared since January 1, 2019 by third-party
actuaries (or Parent's internal actuaries if such actuarial analyses were
shared with any Governmental Authorities) and are available as of the date of
this Agreement. Any information and data furnished by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to actuaries, independent or otherwise, in connection with the
preparation of such actuarial analyses were derived, in all material respects,
from the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each such actuarial
analysis was based upon, in all material respects, a complete and accurate
inventory of Parent Insurance Policies in force at the relevant time of
preparation and was prepared in all material respects in conformity with
generally accepted actuarial principles in effect at such time, consistently
applied (except as may be noted therein).

Section xx.. Opinion of Financial Advisor. On or prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Parent Board has received the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent with respect to the Company Shares,
the Company Options and the Company's restricted stock, performance stock
awards and restricted stock awards is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent. It is agreed and understood that such opinion is for the benefit of
the Parent Board and may not be relied on by the Company for any purpose.

Section xxi.. Financing.

(1) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company a true and correct copy of a fully executed debt commitment letter
(as amended from time to time after the date hereof in compliance with Section
5.14, the "Debt Commitment Letter") providing the terms and conditions upon
which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (together with any other person that becomes
party to such letter as an arranger or a lender after the date hereof,
collectively, the "Lenders") have committed to provide the full amount of
financing described therein (the "Debt Financing"). As of the date of this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in
full force and effect, and the Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any
respect and no waiver has been granted thereunder, no such amendment,
supplement, waiver or modification is contemplated except as expressly set
forth therein, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission
thereof is contemplated (it being understood that the exercise of "market
flex" provisions under the Fee Letter (as defined below) shall not be deemed
an amendment, supplement, waiver or modification). The obligations to fund the
full amount of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter are not
subject to any conditions or contingencies other than as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.01 and Section 6.02, there is no fact or occurrence existing as of
the date of this Agreement that makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect or that causes
the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective with respect to Parent, that in
each case could reasonably be expected to constitute a material breach by
Parent under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, that
precludes or is reasonably likely to preclude the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or that, subject to the
consummation of any Other Financing Arrangement (as defined in Section 5.14),
could otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being available at or prior
to the time that the Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. All commitment and other fees required to be paid under the
Debt Commitment Letter on or prior to the date hereof have been paid. As of
the date of this Agreement, Parent has provided the Company with a complete
copy of all fee letters (collectively, the "Fee Letter") relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter, subject to redactions solely of fee amounts and economic
and other commercially sensitive terms, none of which redacted provisions
could reasonably be expected to affect the conditionality, enforceability,
availability or aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing.

(2) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company a true and correct copy of a fully executed equity commitment
letter (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment
Letters, the "Commitment Letters") providing the terms and conditions upon
which the counterparty thereto (the "Equity Investor") has committed to
provide the full amount of financing described therein (the "Equity Financing"
and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). As of the date of
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and the Equity Investor, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect, and
the Equity Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated
or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect and no waiver
has been granted thereunder, no such amendment, supplement, waiver or
modification is contemplated except as expressly set forth therein, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated.
The obligation to fund the full amount of the commitment under the Equity
Commitment Letter is not subject to any conditions or contingencies other than
as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter delivered to the Company on the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02, there is no
fact or occurrence existing as of the date of this Agreement that makes any of
the assumptions or statements set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect or that causes the Equity Commitment Letter
to be ineffective with respect to Parent, that could reasonably be expected to
constitute a material breach by Parent under the terms and conditions of the
Equity Commitment Letter, that precludes or is reasonably likely to preclude
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter
or that could otherwise result in the Equity Financing not being available on
a timely basis at or prior to the time that the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All commitment and other fees
required to be paid under the Equity Commitment Letter on or prior to the date
hereof have been paid. (3) Subject to its terms and conditions, the Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof,
together with the proceeds of any Other Financing Arrangements, will provide
Parent with sufficient funds to pay the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration required to be paid in cash, cash consideration payable to
holders of Company Awards pursuant to Section 2.03 and any other amount
required to be paid in cash in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, including any obligations of the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries that become due or payable by the Surviving Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Merger, and to pay all
related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub (such amount, the "Required
Cash Amount").

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the receipt or availability
of any funds or Financing by or to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent be a
condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations hereunder.

Section xxii.. Solvency. Assuming that (a) the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Article III are true and correct in all material
respects, (b) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (c) all estimates,
projections and forecasts of the Company provided to Parent by the Company or
its Representatives have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
that were and are reasonable and (d) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are Solvent, then
at and immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to all
of the Transactions, including the funding of the Financing and any payment of
all or part of the Required Cash Amount, Parent, the Surviving Company and
each Subsidiary of the Surviving Company will be, on a consolidated basis,
Solvent. Parent and Merger Sub are not entering into the Transactions with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.

Section xxiii.. Certain Arrangements. Other than the Company Voting Agreement
and the Waiver Agreements, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Contracts or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or
commitments to enter into Contracts or other arrangements or understandings
(whether oral or written) (a) between Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's management or the
Company Board, on the other hand, that relate in any way to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the Transactions, (b) pursuant to which any shareholder
of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
shareholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve the Merger and this
Agreement or agrees to vote against any Company Superior Proposal or (c)
between Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any holder of Company Awards, on the other hand, pursuant to which such holder
would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature
than the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.03.

Section xxiv.. Brokers and Other Advisors. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent pursuant to an
engagement letter, a copy of which has been provided to the Company, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section xxv.. Ownership of Company Shares. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Affiliates beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13d-3 of
the Exchange Act), or will prior to the Closing Date beneficially own, any
Company Shares or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Company Shares, or is a party, or will prior to the Closing
Date become a party, to any Contract, other arrangement or understanding
(whether written or oral) (other than this Agreement and the Company Voting
Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any
Company Shares.

Section xxvi.. Investment Intention. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of the Surviving Company for its own account, for investment
purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in
Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the
shares of the Surviving Company have not been registered under the Securities
Act and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act
or an exemption from such registration is available.

Section xxvii.. Anti-Corruption; Trade Compliance.

(1) In the past five (5) years, Parent and its Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
and agents (collectively, the "Parent Relevant Persons") have not directly or
indirectly violated any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (as amended) or any other applicable anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws
or regulations except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(2) In the past five (5) years, the Parent Relevant Persons have not in the
course of their actions for, or on behalf of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries engaged directly or indirectly in transactions: (i) with any of

OFAC, or by any other applicable economic or trade sanctions law applicable to
the jurisdictions in which Parent and its Subsidiaries are domiciled or
operate, except, in each of clauses (i) through (iii), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section xxviii.. Real Property. Except as would not constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (a) Parent or one of its Subsidiaries has fee simple
title to each parcel of real property owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, and a good and valid leasehold interest in each Parent Lease, in
each case free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and (b)
none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received or given notice of any
default under any Parent Lease, which default continues on the date of this
Agreement. Section xxix.. No Other Representations or Warranties. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and that it and its Representatives have received
access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives
have desired or requested to review for such purpose and that it and its
Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and to discuss the business, operations, assets,

and warranties made by Parent and the Merger Sub in this Article IV, none of
Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any other express or implied

Sub or any other Person makes or has made any express or implied
representation or warranty to the Company or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates with respect to (a) any financial projection, forecast, estimate,

Company or its Representatives or Affiliates in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in connection with the Company's consideration and
review of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless any such information is
expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in this Article
IV. Parent acknowledges that a Contagion Event has had, is having and is
likely to continue to have, an impact on the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their business and, to the extent that any representation or warranty of the
Company herein is or becomes inaccurate or breached as a result of the impact
of a Contagion Event or any action or inaction by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including their compliance with any directive, order, policy,
guidance or recommendation by any Governmental Authority or any disaster plan
of the Company or any change in applicable Law as a result of a Contagion
Event, then such representation or warranty shall not be deemed breached for
any purpose under this Agreement. PARENT acknowledges that, if the Closing

Section ii.. No Solicitation by the Company; Change in Recommendation.

(1) Except as permitted by this Section 5.02, from and after the date hereof,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, directors,
executive officers and employees to, and shall direct its other
Representatives to, (i) cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons
that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal (and shall
promptly require any such Person to return or destroy, in accordance with the
terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, any information furnished
by or on behalf of the Company and shall take commercially reasonable action
to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such Person's
obligations under any applicable confidentiality agreement) and (ii) until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, induce
or knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be likely to lead
to, a Company Alternative Proposal or (B) engage in or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any other Person regarding, or furnish
to any other Person any material non-public information for the purpose of
facilitating, a Company Alternative Proposal. The Company shall promptly
terminate access by any Person to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any Company Alternative Proposal. The Company shall promptly
inform its Representatives of the Company's obligations under this Section
5.02 and shall be liable for any action taken by any Subsidiary, director,
executive officer or employee of the Company that, if taken by the Company,
would constitute a breach of this Section 5.02.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time following the date
hereof and prior to the Company obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval the
Company receives a Company Alternative Proposal, which Company Alternative
Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02, then (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons
making the Company Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof or to request that any Company Alternative Proposal made orally be
made in writing and (ii) if the Company Board determines, in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be likely to lead
to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person or group of Persons making such Company Alternative Proposal;
provided that the Company will not furnish any non-public information
regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Person or group of Persons
without first entering into an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement
with the Person or group of Persons making the Company Alternative Proposal;
provided, further, that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person to the extent access to such
information was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and
(y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person or group of Persons making such Company Alternative Proposal. In no
event may the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse
or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide any
compensation to, any Person or group of Persons (or any of its or their
Representatives or potential financing sources) making a Company Alternative
Proposal, unless such payment or reimbursement is pursuant to a Contract in
effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(3) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours), notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Company
Alternative Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Alternative Proposal (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and the name of the Person or group of Persons making such Company
Alternative Proposal. The Company shall provide all information as is
reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed on a current basis of any
material developments with respect to, and the status and terms of, any such
Company Alternative Proposal (including any material changes thereto). For the
avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02
will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(4) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) qualify,
withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the Company
Board Recommendation or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) if a Company Alternative Proposal has been
publicly disclosed, fail to publicly recommend against such Company
Alternative Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days of the request of Parent to take such action or
(C) approve, adopt or recommend any Company Alternative Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, amalgamation agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Company Alternative Proposal, other than any Acceptable Company
Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(b) (each, a "Company
Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the Company Shareholder
Approval is obtained, the Company Board may, if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, if the Company has
received a Company Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; provided that (x) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a
"Company Notice") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of such Company Alternative Proposal and (y) at or after 5:00 p.m.,
Bermuda time, on the third Business Day following the day on which the Company
delivered the Company Notice, during which such period the Company shall have
negotiated, and caused any of its applicable Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, the Company Board, determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that
such Company Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change in the financial
terms or any other material amendment to the terms and conditions of such
Company Superior Proposal will require a new Company Notice and a new two (2)
Business Day period). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the parties acknowledge and agree that Company Board
will take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to
in writing, and not withdrawn, by Parent by 5:00 p.m., Bermuda time, on the
last day of the three (3) Business Day period or two (2) Business Day period,
as applicable, following a Company Notice.

(5) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to Section 5.02(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.02(e)),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board, prior
to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, from making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if there has been an Intervening Event
and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that:

(a) the Company shall give Parent a written notice of its intention to take
such action (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the
Company nor any public announcement that the Company Board is considering
making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change under applicable Law shall
constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) and providing a reasonably
detailed description of such Intervening Event;

(b) the Company shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days following
receipt by Parent of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any,
during such three (3)-Business Day period; and

(c) following expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board again makes the determination set forth in Section 5.02(e).

(6) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from
(i) taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (it being understood that
any such communication to the shareholders of the Company shall not be deemed
to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii) making any disclosure
or communication to shareholders of the Company if the Company Board
determines in good faith, based on the written advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure or communication would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(7) As used in this Agreement, "Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement"
shall mean any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and
after the date of this Agreement that contains terms that are not less
favorable in all matters to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and does not prohibit the Company from complying
with its obligations set forth in this Section 5.02.

(8) As used in this Agreement, "Company Alternative Proposal" shall mean,
other than the Transactions, any inquiry, proposal (whether or not in writing)
or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries)
relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any
direct or indirect (i) acquisition (including any reinsurance or retrocession
transaction, or transaction that has similar risk transfer effects) that, if
consummated, would result in any Person or group (other than the Existing
Shareholder) owning (x) 100% of the Company Reserves, revenues or net income
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) 15% or more of
the consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined
in good faith by the Company Board) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (ii) acquisition of Company Shares representing 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Shares (other than by the Existing Shareholder), (iii) merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, share purchase, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which such Person
or group (or the shareholders of any Person) (other than the Existing
Shareholder) would acquire, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the
aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity in such
transaction or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity or (iv) any combination of the foregoing, whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions; provided, however, that
"Company Alternative Proposal" shall not include any inquiry, proposal
(whether or not in writing) or offer (x) with respect to any restructuring,
reorganization or recapitalization of CMB or other similar transaction
involving CMB or its securityholders that does not result in a sale of capital
stock, assets or businesses of the Company or (y) made mutually by Parent, CMB
and the Company, or by the Company with the consent of Parent and CMB, as part
of or in connection with, the negotiation or settlement of any claims brought
Series B Preferred Shareholders with respect to the rights or obligations of
the Series B Preferred Shareholders or the Company relating to the Company
Preference Shares.

(9) As used in this Agreement, "Company Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide written Company Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.02 and that the Company Board has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all relevant (in the view of the Company
Board) legal, regulatory, financial and other aspects of such proposal
(including the conditionality and the timing and the likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), would be more favorable to the Company and its
shareholders than the Merger; provided that, for purposes of the definition of
"Company Superior Proposal", the references to "15%" in the definition of
Company Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

(10) As used in this Agreement, "Intervening Event" shall mean any event,
occurrence, fact, condition or change occurring or arising after the date of
this Agreement that (i) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the
Company Board prior to the execution of this Agreement, which event,
occurrence, fact, condition or change becomes known to the Company prior to
the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and (ii) does not relate to
(A) a Company Alternative Proposal or (B) any (x) changes in the market price
or trading volume of the Company's securities or (y) the Company meeting,
failing to meet or exceeding published or unpublished revenue or earnings
projections, in each case in and of itself (it being understood that the facts
or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such change or event may be
taken into account when determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred).

(11) As used in this Section 5.02, Section 5.03 and Section 5.04, "group" has
the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section iii.. No Solicitation by Parent; Change in Recommendation.

(1) Except as permitted by this Section 5.03, from and after the date hereof,
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, directors, executive

with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, any information
furnished by or on behalf of Parent and shall take all commercially reasonable
action to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such Person's
obligations under any applicable confidentiality agreement) and (ii) until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, induce
or knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be likely to lead to, a Parent Alternative Proposal or (B) engage
in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any other
Person regarding, or furnish to any other Person any material non-public
information for the purpose of facilitating, a Parent Alternative Proposal.
Parent shall promptly terminate access by any Person to any physical or

shall promptly inform its Representatives of Parent's obligations under this
Section 5.03 and shall be liable for any action taken by any Subsidiary,
director, executive officer or employee of Parent that, if taken by Parent,
would constitute a breach of this Section 5.03.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.03(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time following the date
hereof and prior to Parent obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval Parent
receives a Parent Alternative Proposal, which Parent Alternative Proposal did
not result from a breach of this Section 5.03, then (i) Parent and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons making the Parent
Alternative Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to request
that any Parent Alternative Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii)
if the Parent Board determines, in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Alternative
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be likely to lead to a Parent
Superior Proposal, then Parent and its Representatives may (x) furnish
information with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group
of Persons making such Parent Alternative Proposal; provided that Parent will

Parent Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making
the Parent Alternative Proposal; provided, further, that Parent shall promptly
provide to the Company any material non-public information concerning Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person to the extent access
to such information was not previously provided to the Company or its
Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Parent
Alternative Proposal. In no event may Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to
reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to
provide any compensation to, any Person or group of Persons (or any of its or
their Representatives or potential financing sources) making a Parent
Alternative Proposal, unless such payment or reimbursement is pursuant to a
Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(3) Parent shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) notify the Company in the event that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Parent Alternative
Proposal and shall disclose to the Company the material terms and conditions
of any such Parent Alternative Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and the name of the Person or group of Persons making such Parent
Alternative Proposal. Parent shall provide all information as is reasonably
necessary to keep the Company informed on a current basis of any material
developments with respect to, and the status and terms of, any such Parent
Alternative Proposal (including any material changes thereto). For the
avoidance of doubt, all information provided to the Company pursuant to this
Section 5.03 will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(4) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) qualify,
withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Company) the Parent
Board Recommendation or fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement, (B) if a Parent Alternative Proposal has been publicly
disclosed, fail to publicly recommend against such Parent Alternative Proposal
or fail to reaffirm the Parent Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business
Days of the request of the Company to take such action or (C) approve, adopt
or recommend any Parent Alternative Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a "Parent Adverse Recommendation Change") or
(ii) authorize, cause or permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, amalgamation agreement or
other similar agreement related to any Parent Alternative Proposal, other than
any Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to Section 5.03(b)
(each, a "Parent Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the
Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Parent Board may, if the Parent
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, if
Parent has received a Parent Superior Proposal, make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided that (x) Parent delivers to the Company a
written notice (a "Parent Notice") advising the Company that Parent intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material
terms and conditions of such Parent Alternative Proposal and (y) at or after
5:00 p.m., Bermuda time, on the third Business Day following the day on which
Parent delivered the Parent Notice, during which such period Parent shall have
negotiated, and caused any of its applicable Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with the Company with respect to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company, the Parent Board, determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that
such Parent Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change in the financial
terms or any other material amendment to the terms and conditions of such
Parent Superior Proposal will require a new Parent Notice and a new two (2)
Business Day period). In determining whether to make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Parent Board will take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing, and not withdrawn, by the
Company by 5:00 p.m., Bermuda time, on the last day of the three (3) Business
Day period or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, following a Parent
Notice.

(5) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to shareholders of Parent a position or communication
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (it being
understood that any such communication to the shareholders of Parent shall not
be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii) making any
disclosure or communication to shareholders of Parent if the Parent Board
determines in good faith, based on the written advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure or communication would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(6) As used in this Agreement, "Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement"
shall mean any confidentiality agreement entered into by Parent from and after
the date of this Agreement that contains terms that are not less favorable in
all matters to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and does not prohibit Parent from complying with its obligations set forth in
this Section 5.03.

(7) As used in this Agreement, "Parent Alternative Proposal" shall mean, other
than the Transactions, any inquiry, proposal (whether or not in writing) or
offer from any Person or group (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any
direct or indirect (i) acquisition (including any reinsurance or retrocession
transaction, or transaction that has similar risk transfer effects) that, if
consummated, would result in any Person or group owning (x) 100% of the Parent
Reserves, revenues or net income of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (y) 15% or more of the consolidated assets (based on the fair market
value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Parent Board) of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition of Parent Shares
representing 15% or more of the outstanding Parent Shares, (iii) merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, share purchase, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which such Person or
group (or the shareholders of any Person) would acquire, directly or
indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of Parent or of the
surviving entity in such transaction or the resulting direct or indirect
parent of Parent or such surviving entity or (iv) any combination of the
foregoing, whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions.

(8) As used in this Agreement, "Parent Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide written Parent Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.03 and that the Parent Board has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all relevant (in the view of the Parent
Board) legal, regulatory, financial and other aspects of such proposal
(including the conditionality and the timing and the likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), would be more favorable to Parent and its
shareholders than the Merger; provided that, for purposes of the definition of
"Parent Superior Proposal", the references to "15%" in the definition of
Parent Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

Section iv.. Preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement; Shareholders Meetings.

(1) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and in any event within 30 Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
(i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and
file it with the SEC and (ii) Parent (with the assistance and cooperation of the Company) shall prepare the Registration
Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus, and file it with the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act and (B) have the Joint Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC, in each case as promptly as practicable after such filing,
and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger. Subject to Section 5.02, the Company Board shall make
the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of Company Shares and shall
include such Company Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement.
Subject to Section 5.03, the Parent Board shall make the Parent Board
Recommendation to the holders of Parent Shares and shall include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall provide to the other all information concerning it and its Subsidiaries
as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the
preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and
shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the other party in the preparation
of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and the resolution
of any comments thereto received from the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement if and to the extent
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply the other party with
copies of all written correspondence between such party and the SEC with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, as the
case may be. Each of Parent and the Company shall (1) to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, as
applicable, and any amendment or supplement thereto, and any written
communications with the SEC (including any responses to any comments of the
SEC) prior to disseminating the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective
shareholders or filing the Registration Statement with the SEC, (2) consider
in good faith any comments on the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or such other document or written communication with the SEC, as
applicable, reasonably proposed by the other party and (3) not disseminate the
Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders or file the
Registration Statement with the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the
other (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided that with respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the
other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations, or
the combined entity; provided, further, that this approval right shall not
apply with respect to information relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. If, at any time prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as the case
may be, any information relating to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Affiliates, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such
notification, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall file with the SEC an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information as promptly as
practicable after the other party has had a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon, and, to the extent an amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement is filed, to the extent required by applicable Law,
Parent and the Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to their
respective shareholders.

(2) Subject to Section 5.04(a), the Company shall take all necessary actions
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Organizational Documents and
the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment,
reconvening or postponement thereof, the "Company Shareholders Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than thirty (30)
days) following effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion,
adjourn, reconvene or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting or change the
record date with respect thereto if the Company reasonably believes that,
after consultation with Parent, (i) such adjournment, reconvening,
postponement or change of the record date is necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to
the holders of Company Shares within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement), (A) there will be an insufficient number of Company Shares present
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Shareholders Meeting or (B) there will be an
insufficient number of proxies to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval
(provided that the Company Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
by more than an aggregate of fifteen days in connection with any postponements
or adjournments in reliance on this clause (ii)) or (iii) such adjournment,
reconvening, postponement or change of the record date is required by Law or a
court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in connection
with any Actions in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or has
been requested by the SEC or its staff. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been
earlier terminated, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and to hold a vote of its
shareholders for purposes of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Company Alternative Proposal (whether
or not a Company Superior Proposal), by an Intervening Event or by a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made by it; provided, however, that if the
public announcement of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery
of a Company Notice or a notice contemplated by Section 5.02(e)(i) is less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company shall be entitled to postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to a
date not more than ten (10) Business Days after such event. If the Company
makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) the Company shall
nevertheless submit the matters contemplated by the Company Shareholder
Approval to a vote of its shareholders and (y) the Joint Proxy Statement and
any and all accompanying materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with applicable Law.

(3) Subject to Section 5.04(a), Parent shall take all necessary actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Parent Organizational Documents and the
rules of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment,
reconvening or postponement thereof, the "Parent Shareholders Meeting") as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than thirty (30)
days) following effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may, in its sole discretion,
adjourn, reconvene or postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting or change the
record date with respect thereto if Parent reasonably believes that, after
consultation with the Company, (i) such adjournment, reconvening, postponement
or change of the record date is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the
holders of Parent Shares within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Parent Shareholders Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the Parent
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement), (A) there will be an insufficient number of Parent Shares present
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Shareholders Meeting or (B) there will be an
insufficient number of proxies to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval
(provided that the Parent Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
by more than an aggregate of fifteen days in connection with any postponements
or adjournments in reliance on this clause (ii)) or (iii) such adjournment,
reconvening, postponement or change of the record date is required by Law or a
court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in connection
with any Actions in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or has
been requested by the SEC or its staff. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been
earlier terminated, the obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting and to hold a vote of its
shareholders for purposes of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Parent Alternative Proposal (whether
or not a Parent Superior Proposal) or by a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change made by it; provided, however, that if the public announcement of a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery of a Parent Notice is
less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Parent Shareholders Meeting,
Parent shall be entitled to postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting to a date
not more than ten (10) Business Days after such event. If Parent makes a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) Parent shall nevertheless submit the
matters contemplated by the Parent Shareholder Approval to a vote of its
shareholders and (y) the Joint Proxy Statement and any and all accompanying
materials may include appropriate disclosure with respect to such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with applicable Law.

(4) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting,
respectively, at the same time and on the same date as the other party. Section v.. Reasonable Best Efforts.

(1) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

other Transactions, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary, proper or advisable actions or nonactions, consents, approvals,
authorizations, waivers and qualifications from Governmental Authorities and
making all necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices

obtain a consent, approval, authorization, waiver or exemption from any
Governmental Authority (including under Insurance Laws and the HSR Act) and
(ii) executing and delivering any additional agreements, documents or
instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(2) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly (whether by merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise),
acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or
license) any business, corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of
assets, if doing so would reasonably be likely to: (i) impose any material
delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining,
consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers of Governmental Authorities
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or
(iv) otherwise impair or delay the ability of Parent to perform its material
obligations under this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Section
5.05(b) shall prohibit Parent and its Subsidiaries from acquiring or investing
in managing general underwriters or managing general agents or taking the
actions described in Section 5.05(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

(3) In furtherance and without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent shall file a

certificates, with the New York Department of Financial Services and the
Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, within thirty (30) calendar days

Division of the United States Department of Justice with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and requesting early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof (but in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date hereof), and (iv) Parent and the Company, as
applicable, shall make any and all necessary filings or notices with the applicable Governmental Authorities, including with respect to those
Governmental Approvals set forth in Schedule 6.01(b) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof (but in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date hereof). All filing fees payable in connection
with the foregoing shall be borne by Parent. Subject to Section 5.08, Parent
and the Company agree to promptly provide, or cause to be provided, all
agreements, documents, instruments or information that may be required or
requested by any Governmental Authority relating to Parent or its Affiliates,
on the one hand, or the Company or its Affiliates, or its or their respect
structure, ownership, businesses, operations, regulatory and legal compliance,
assets, liabilities, financing, financial condition or results of operations,
or any of its or their directors, officers, employees, partners, members or
shareholders.

(4) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it shall consult
with one another with respect to the obtaining of all consents, approvals,
authorizations or waivers of Governmental Authorities necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the other reasonably
apprised on a prompt basis of the status of matters relating to such consents,
approvals, authorizations or waivers. Parent and the Company shall have the
right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, and subject to any
restrictions under applicable Law, each shall consult the other on, any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority or
any third party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party agrees to in good faith consider and reasonably
accept comments of the other parties thereon. Parent and the Company shall
promptly furnish to each other copies of all such filings and written
materials after their filing or submission, in each case subject to applicable
Laws.

(5) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent, approval,
authorization or waiver is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing each other
copies of any written or electronic communications, and shall promptly advise
each other when any such communication causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent, approval, authorization or
waiver will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent, approval,
authorization or waiver will be materially delayed or conditioned.

(6) None of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective controlled Affiliates not to, permit any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, members, shareholders or any other
Representatives to participate in any live or telephonic meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meeting. (7) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall a party to this Agreement or any of its controlled Affiliates be
required to agree to take or enter into any action which would be required to

documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving

Parent in preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section vii.. Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other and with CM Bermuda Limited (together with its Affiliates, as
applicable, "CMB") before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements (including scheduling of a press conference or conference
call with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall refer to the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, and not CMB), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without
the prior consent of any other party, issue such press release or make such
public statement (a) as may be required by Law or Order, the applicable rules
of NASDAQ or the NYSE or any listing agreement with NASDAQ the NYSE or (b) to
enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement. The Company shall not
make any internal announcements or other communications to its employees or
other constituents with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on
such announcement or communication, which the Company shall consider in good
faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may make any oral
or written public announcements, releases or statements without complying with
the foregoing requirements if the substance of such announcements, releases or
statements, was publicly disclosed and previously subject to the foregoing
requirements.

Law, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (a) provide to

properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of such party and its Subsidiaries as Parent or the Company, as
applicable, or their respective Representatives may reasonably request;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (or to cause any their respective Subsidiaries
to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the
Company or Parent, as applicable, believes in good faith that doing so would:
(i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity
or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine (provided that the applicable
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of such privilege or
doctrine); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of such party or any
of its Subsidiaries to any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or
violate any then effective Contract to which such party or any of its
Subsidiaries is party; (iii) result in a competitor of such party or any of
its Subsidiaries receiving information that is competitively sensitive; (iv)
require such party or its Subsidiaries to provide any personnel file, medical
file or related records of any Company Employee or employee of Parent, or (v)
breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including any Antitrust Law)
or Order. During any visit by the Company or Parent to the business or
property sites of the other party or any of its respective Subsidiaries, the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws
and all of the other party's and its respective Subsidiaries', as applicable,
safety and security procedures, including those related to a Contagion Event.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.08, from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates shall conduct, without the prior written
consent of the other party, any environmental investigation at any real
property owned or leased by such other party or any of its Affiliates, and in
no event may any environmental investigation include any sampling or other
intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything
else at or in connection with any of such real property. Each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
(including, with respect to Parent, Merger Sub) and its and their respective
Representatives to, hold all information provided or furnished by the other
party pursuant to this Section 5.08 confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 5.08 or the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company shall be permitted to disclose any information furnished to it or
any of its Representatives pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 5.08 to the
Existing Shareholder.

Section ix.. Indemnification and Insurance.

(1) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, together
with such Person's heirs, executors and administrators, an "Indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director
or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any Action relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or
relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in the Company Organizational Documents and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement or in any agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement
(as may be amended, modified or supplemented after the date of this Agreement
to expand the scope of indemnification and exculpation regarding the rights
and obligations of the Strategic Review Committee, the Original SRC Members
and the Independent Shareholder Representatives under Section 8.02) providing
for indemnification between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the memorandum of association
and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, advance the
reasonable and documented expenses (including reasonable and documented fees
and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.09
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this Section 5.09) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law; provided that the individual to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be finally
determined in a non-appealable judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 5.09(a).

(2) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.09 (each, a
"Claim") for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim
without admission of fault, guilt or wrongdoing, or such Indemnitee otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent,
the Surviving Company and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of
any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(3) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the current directors'
and officers' liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are currently (and any
additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount,
no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued
by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy).
The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase a prepaid "tail" policy
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the Transactions;
provided that the premium for such "tail" policy shall not exceed 300% of the
aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company to maintain its
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy. If such prepaid
"tail" policy has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.09(c) and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

(4) The provisions of this Section 5.09 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and his or her heirs and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the
Company Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.09 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.09 applies unless (x) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.09 applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.09).

(5) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.09.

(6) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.09 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies. Section x.. Rule 16b-3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to take such actions as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or
director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section xi.. Employee Matters.

(1) From the Effective Time though December 31, 2021 or, if longer, the time
required by applicable law (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Company (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company, its
successors and assigns) to provide, each individual who is employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the
Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee"), with (i) base salary, wage rate
and short-term incentive opportunity that in each case is no less favorable
than that provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(2) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume,
honor and continue during the Continuation Period (or such longer period as
required by applicable Law or the terms of the Company Plan) all of the
Company Plans, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Severance
Plan, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time and in accordance with
their terms.

(3) With respect to any current year accrued but unused paid time off to which
any Company Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy or
individual agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Paid Time Off Policy"), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) allow such Company
Employee to use such accrued but unused paid time off and (ii) if any Company
Employee's employment terminates during the Continuation Period, pay the
Company Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the current year
accrued but unused paid time off to the same extent that the Company Employee
would have received a cash payment therefor under the Paid Time Off Policy as
in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(4) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees commence to participate
following the Effective Time, including any "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off and severance
plans), (i) for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting
and (ii) for purposes of calculating paid time off and severance pay, each
Company Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall
be treated as service with the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and
business of the Surviving Company, its successors and assigns) to the same
extent such service was credited before the Effective Time under the Company
Plan that provided the same or substantially similar benefit; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

(5) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) commence to participate from and after the Effective
Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior
to such commencement of participation and (ii) honor any co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which such commencement
of participation occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(6) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or term of similar
import), the occurrence of the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change
in control" or "change of control" (or such term of similar import) under such
Company Plan.

(7) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.11 is intended
to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment
to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, including any
Company Plan, (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or
interference with the right or obligation of Parent or its Subsidiaries to
make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (iii)
alter or limit Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries, following the Closing) ability to terminate the
employment of any Employee.

(8) Except as otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

Section xii.. Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation; Series
B Claims. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any Actions
commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against such party which
relate to this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions.
Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate, at Parent's sole cost and expense, in the defense and settlement
of any shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement,
the Statutory Merger Agreement or the Transactions, and shall not settle any
such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that such
consent shall not be required with respect to any settlement (a) that would
not impose equitable relief on, and would not provide for the admission of
wrongdoing by, the Company or any of its directors, as the case may be, and
(b) the monetary portion of which has been reserved for by the Company or is
covered by insurance policies of the Company or its directors within
applicable limits and deductibles. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall and shall cause its Representatives to (i) give prompt notice to Parent
of any substantive information that comes to its attention, or any material
communication received, regarding the Series B Claims, in each case from the
Series B Preferred Shareholders, (ii) not make any admission of liability with
respect to the Series B Claims and (iii) not settle the Series B Claims
without Parent's prior consent.

Section xiii.. Merger Sub Shareholder Approval. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving the Merger, this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement (the "Merger Sub Shareholder
Approval").

Section xiv.. Financing.

(1) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and to consummate
the Financing as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, but on or prior to the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, which reasonable best
efforts shall include (i) entering into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on terms and conditions no less
favorable to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letters after
giving effect to the "market flex" provisions under the Fee Letter (the
"Financing Agreements"), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis or obtaining the
waiver of all conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements, (iii) consummating the Financing at or prior to the time upon
which Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (it
being understood that, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement
for Parent to obtain the Financing) and (iv) enforcing its rights under the
Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements, except, in the case of
clauses (i) through (iv) above, to the extent (and solely to the extent)
Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries has (x) issued in one or more
offerings any debt or equity securities in lieu of the Debt Financing on or
prior to the Closing Date (any such offering, a "Securities Offering" and
collectively, the "Securities Offerings") and/or (y) obtained financing in the
form of loans (including under a revolving line of credit), notes or other
similar instruments in lieu of the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing
Date (collectively with any Securities Offerings, the "Other Financing
Arrangements") that provides sufficient proceeds, together with available and
unrestricted cash on hand of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the proceeds of
the Equity Financing, to pay the Required Cash Amount. Other than as set forth
in Section 5.14(b) and Section 5.14(c), Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain in effect each Commitment Letter, except to the extent
(and solely to the extent) Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries has closed one or more Other Financing Arrangements that provides
sufficient proceeds, together with available and unrestricted cash on hand of
Parent and its Subsidiaries and the proceeds of the Equity Financing, to pay
the Required Cash Amount. Parent must, upon the reasonable request by the
Company, (A) keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
any Other Financing Arrangements and (B) provide the Company with copies of
all definitive agreements and other material documents related to the Debt
Financing and any Other Financing Arrangement in connection with its
satisfaction of obligations pursuant to clause (d) below. Parent shall give
the Company written notice as promptly as practicable (and in any event,
within two (2) Business Days) (x) of any material breach or default by any
party to any of the Financing Commitments or definitive agreements related to
the Financing or any documentation governing any Other Financing Arrangement
of which Parent becomes aware, and/or (y) of the receipt of any (1) written
notice or (2) other written communication, in each case from any Lender or
Equity Investor with respect to (I) any actual breach or default, or any
termination or repudiation, in each case in any material respect, by any party
to any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of any Financing or definitive agreements related
to the Financing or (II) dispute or disagreement between or among the parties
to any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing or any documentation governing any Other Financing Arrangement with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or such Other Financing
Arrangement or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing that
would reasonably be expected to (A) make the funding of the Financing or such
Other Financing Arrangement less likely to occur or (B) materially delay or
prevent the Closing, or (y) reduce the aggregate amount available under the
Commitment Letters (including as a result of the imposition of any "flex"
terms in the Fee Letter) below an amount that, when combined with available
and unrestricted cash on hand of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the proceeds
of any Other Financing Arrangements, is sufficient to pay the Required Cash
Amount (but excluding in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary
course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or any
definitive agreement with respect thereto). Parent must provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date that
the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent.

(2) If, prior to the earliest of (x) the Closing, (y) the consummation of
Other Financing Arrangements that provide sufficient proceeds, together with
available and unrestricted cash on hand of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the
proceeds of the Equity Financing, to pay the Required Cash Amount and (z) the
amount of available and unrestricted cash on Parent's balance sheet being
sufficient, together with the proceeds of the Equity Financing, to pay the
Required Cash Amount (such earliest date, the "Satisfaction Date"), any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or Parent becomes aware of
any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt Financing
unavailable, on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions in
the Fee Letter) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent will
promptly notify the Company in writing (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the occurrence or discovery thereof) and Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
financing from the same or alternative sources on terms not less favorable to Parent than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter, containing
conditions to draw, conditions to Closing and other terms that would
reasonably be likely to affect the availability thereof that (A) are not more
onerous in any material respect than those conditions and terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) would not reasonably be likely to materially
delay the Closing or make the Closing materially less likely to occur, and (C)
in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof (the "Alternative Financing") and to obtain (and, when obtained, to
provide the Company with a copy of) a new financing commitment for the
Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"), which
new letter shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in
part. In the event that any Alternative Financing Commitment Letters are
obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letters" or
the "Debt Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent not superseded by an Alternative Financing Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any Alternative Financing Commitment
Letters to the extent then in effect and (B) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the
foregoing.

(3) Other than as set forth in Section 5.14(b), prior to the occurrence of the
Satisfaction Date, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), replace,
amend, modify, supplement or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent such replacement, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
(individually or in the aggregate with any other replacements, amendments,
supplements, modifications or waivers) would reasonably be expected to (x)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof) to an amount
that would not, together with available and unrestricted cash on hand of
Parent and its Subsidiaries and the proceeds of the Equity Financing, be
sufficient to pay the Required Cash Amount, or (y) impose any new or
additional condition, or otherwise replace, amend, modify or expand any
condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (I) materially delay or prevent the
Closing, or (II) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against any other party under the Debt Commitment Letter
(collectively, the "Restricted Debt Commitment Letter Amendments"); provided
that, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 5.14(c), the Parent
may replace, amend, supplement, modify or waive the Debt Commitment Letter (to
the extent not prohibited by this Section 5.14(c)) (including to add
additional agents, co-agents, lenders, lead arrangers, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, together with any conforming or ministerial changes related thereto,
but only if the addition of such parties, individually or in the aggregate,
would not result in the occurrence of a Restricted Debt Commitment Letter
Amendment). Upon any such replacement, amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance
with this Section 5.14(c), the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall mean the
Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced, amended, modified or waived and the
term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Debt Financing contemplated by any such Debt Commitment Letter as so replaced,
amended, supplemented, modified or waived. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company true and correct copies of any such
replacement, amendment, restatement, modification, supplement, waiver or
substitution of the Debt Commitment Letters.

(4) From the date hereof and until the Satisfaction Date, the Company shall,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide
all reasonable cooperation as is customary for financings of this type
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing or the Other
Financing Arrangements, including using reasonable best efforts to:

(a) furnish, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such historical financial
and other pertinent information (including such information that is reasonably
necessary for Parent's preparation of pro forma financial statements)
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing or the
Other Financing Arrangements;

(b) cause senior management of the Company to participate in a reasonable
number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties
acting as underwriters, initial purchasers, lead arrangers, bookrunners or
agents for, and prospective Financing Sources for, for the Debt Financing or
the Other Financing Arrangements), presentations, road shows, sessions with
rating agencies, and due diligence sessions in connection with the Debt
Financing or the Other Financing Arrangements;

(c) (A) provide customary assistance with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, bridge teasers,
syndication memoranda, lender presentations, offering memoranda, prospectuses
and other customary marketing materials (collectively, the "Offering
Materials") required in connection with the Debt Financing or the Other
Financing Arrangements, including furnishing (y) records, data or other
information necessary to support any statistical information or claims
relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries appearing in the
aforementioned materials and (z) customary certificates of the chief financial
officer (or other comparable officer) of the Company with respect to financial
information (including pro forma financial information); (B) provide
reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of the Financing Sources
to the extent reasonable and customary (and, to the extent applicable, subject
to the limitations contained in this Agreement) and (C) provide customary
authorization letters with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors (including, solely as to the Company and its Subsidiaries, customary
10b-5 and material non-public information representations);

(d) promptly, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing, provide all documentation and other information that any underwriter,
initial purchaser, arranger or bookrunner of, or agent, trustee, depositary or
Financing Source for, any Debt Financing or Other Financing Arrangements has
requested in connection with such Debt Financing or Other Financing
Arrangements under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as requested at least eight (8) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date; (e) assist in the preparation, execution and delivery of definitive financing
documents, including guarantee documents, customary closing certificates and
documents, and customary back-up therefor, as may be required by the Debt
Financing or the Other Financing Arrangements and other customary documents as
may reasonably be requested by Parent or the Financing Sources, but, except as
set forth in clause (d)(iii) above, in no event shall (A) any of the items
described in the foregoing be effective until as of or after the Closing or
(B) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to execute or delivery
any solvency certificate or similar certification;

(f) assist Parent in benefitting from the existing lending and investor
relationships of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;

(g) cooperate with Parent and Parent's efforts to obtain corporate and
facilities ratings and legal opinions from Parent's legal counsel, as
reasonably requested by Parent;

(h) take all corporate, limited liability company, partnership or other
similar actions reasonably requested by Parent or any Financing Source to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing; provided that no such actions
shall be required to be effective prior to Closing, and no such actions shall
be required to be taken by any Person who is not continuing in such capacity
after the Closing; and

(i) cause the Company's independent auditors to furnish to Parent and the
Financing Sources promptly with drafts of customary comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort and change period comfort) that the independent
auditors of the Company are prepared to deliver upon "pricing" and "closing"
of any Securities Offerings and the Company's independent auditors to deliver
such comfort letters upon the "pricing" and "closing" of any such Securities
Offerings, and cause the Company's independent auditors to provide customary
auditor consents (including consents with respect to inclusion of the
Company's financial statements and any audit opinions in respect thereof in
any Current Report on Form 8-K, registration statement, prospectus or offering
memorandum or similar documents for any portion of the Debt Financing or any
Securities Offerings).

In no event shall the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives have any obligations under this Section 5.14(d), other than to
cause the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.14(d). The foregoing
notwithstanding, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their
Representatives be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this Section 5.14(d) that would (i) require the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Persons who are officers or directors (or similar
positions) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or any
Other Financing Arrangements or enter into, execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement,
in each case, that is not contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing or
that would be effective prior to the Closing Date (except (I) the
authorization letters set forth in clause (d)(iii)(C) above, (II) the
representation letters required by the Company's auditors in connection with
the delivery of "comfort letters" set forth in clause (d)(ix) above and (III)
any certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company reasonably requested
by Parent's counsel in connection with the delivery of any legal opinions such
counsel may be required to deliver (including the certificate set forth in
clauses (d)(iii) above)), (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be breached by the Company, (iii) require the Company to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing or any Other Financing
Arrangements prior to the Closing (except to the extent such expenses,
liabilities or other obligations are subject to the expense reimbursement or
indemnity provisions set forth in the final two sentences of this clause (d)
below) or have any obligation of the Company under any agreement, certificate,
document or instrument be effective until the Closing (other than information
provided pursuant to any applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations), (iv) cause any director, officer or
employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal liability, (v) unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company, (vi) require the waiver or amendment of any terms of
this Agreement or the payment of any fees or reimbursement of any expenses
prior to the Closing (except to the extent such fees or expenses are subject
to the expense reimbursement or indemnity provisions set forth in the final
two sentences of this clause (d) below), (vii) require delivery of any legal
opinions from legal counsel to the Company or its Subsidiaries or (viii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements or any adjustments to any
pro forma financial information required to be provided in accordance with the
Debt Financing or any Other Financing Arrangements. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.14(d) or otherwise shall require the Company, prior to the Closing,
to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing or any
Other Financing Arrangements. Parent shall, promptly upon written request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in connection with any actions taken in connection
with the Debt Financing or any Other Financing Arrangements or otherwise
pursuant to this Section 5.14(d). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or any Other Financing Arrangements, any
action taken pursuant to this Section 5.14(d) and any information used in
connection with the foregoing (other than information provided in writing by
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.14(d)), except to the extent that any of the foregoing is determined in a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise
from (x) the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company,
its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives or (y) information
provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives in writing expressly for use in connection with the Debt
Financing or any Other Financing Arrangements containing any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 5.14(d) shall be deemed satisfied for purposes of
Section 6.02(b) unless the failure to consummate the Debt Financing is
directly and primarily the result of the Company's breach of its obligations
under this Section 5.14 in respect of the Debt Financing. (5) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt Financing or the Other
Financing Arrangements; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(6) At the request of Parent in connection with any Securities Offering, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file a Form 8-K with the SEC
disclosing information identified by Parent relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of permitting such information to be included in the
Offering Materials to be provided to potential investors who do not wish to
receive material nonpublic information with respect to any of Parent, the
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be required to file a
Form 8-K with the SEC to the extent that the Company reasonably objects to
such disclosure (including as a result of a determination by the Company that
making such disclosure would be detrimental to the business or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

Section xv.. Company Guarantees. From the date hereof until the Closing Date
(or, if earlier, the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII), Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts
and cooperate in good faith to either (a) obtain any requisite consent to the
Transactions from each third-party counterparty to a Company Guarantee,
including, as applicable, a waiver of any objections or rights such third
party may have under the applicable Company Guarantee or (b) terminate and
replace such Company Guarantee with a similar guarantee which is mutually
agreeable to the Company, Parent and such third party.

Section xvi.. Credit Agreement. If requested by Parent, between the date
hereof and the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date of termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to assist the Company to, obtain (a) any requisite consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby from each third-party counterparty to the Credit
Agreement, including, as applicable, a waiver of any objections or rights such
third party may have under the Credit Agreement and (b) (i) an amendment to
extend the maturity of the Credit Agreement and (ii) such other amendments as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided that, at the option of the Company, any such amendments
requested under this clause (b)(ii) shall only be effective on and after the
Closing Date; provided further that, in the event the consent and waiver
described in the foregoing clause (a) cannot be obtained on or prior to the

Termination

Section i.. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or Parent Shareholder
Approval (except as otherwise expressly noted):

(1) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of the Company Board and the Parent Board;

(2) by either of the Company or Parent:

(a) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or prior to May 6, 2021
(as such date may be extended pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i), the "Walk-
Away Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the breach by such
party of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
its failure to act in good faith or its failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Transactions, including to the extent required by
and subject to Section 5.05, has been a principal cause of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date (it being understood that
Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso); provided, further, that, if on a date that
would have been the Walk-Away Date the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(b)
or Section 6.01(c) (as a result of an Order relating to Antitrust Laws) are
the only conditions in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) that shall not have been satisfied
or waived on or before such date, the Company or Parent may unilaterally
extend the Walk-Away Date to August 6, 2021 if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, notifies the other party on or prior to May 6, 2021 of its
intention to extend the Walk-Away Date, in which case the Walk-Away Date shall
be deemed for all purposes to be such later date;

(b) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
or entered an Order permanently preventing or prohibiting the Merger, and such
Order shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this clause (ii) shall not be
available to any party (A) that has failed to use its reasonable best efforts
to remove, contest, resolve or lift, as applicable, such Order or (B) if such
party has failed to fulfill its obligations pursuant to Section 5.05;

(c) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

(d) if the Parent Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Parent Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

(3) by Parent if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its obligations or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and (ii) is
not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if
reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of
the Walk-Away Date and thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Parent
stating Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(c) and the basis for such termination (or in any event has not
been cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c) if Parent
or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
obligations or agreements hereunder, which breach would give rise to a failure
of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b);

(4) by the Company:

(a) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its obligations or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (B) is
not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if
reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of
the Walk-Away Date and thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by Parent
or Merger Sub of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the
Company stating the Company's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) and
the basis for such termination (or in any event has not been cured by the
Walk-Away Date); provided that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) if the Company is
then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, obligations or
agreements hereunder, which breach would give rise to a failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b); or

(b) prior to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, if the Parent Board
shall have effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section ii.. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than Sections 7.02 and 7.03, Article VIII, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the last sentence of Section 5.08, all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except (a) as liability may exist pursuant to the
provisions specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that survive
such termination and (b) that no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability for fraud on the part of such party or any willful and material
breach by such party of any representation, warranty, obligation or agreement
set forth in this Agreement or fraud.

the Company or its designee, within two (2) Business Days following the date
of such termination by the Company, the Parent Termination Fee;

(b) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, then the Company shall pay to
Parent or its designee, within two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the Company
Termination Fee; or

(c) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iv) prior to
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, then Parent shall pay to the
Company or its designee, within two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the Parent
Termination Fee.

(2) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, (i) except in the case of
an intentional and material breach of this Agreement or the Company Voting
Agreement, in the event that the Company Termination Fee is paid by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.03(a), the Company Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination of this Agreement), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any Action against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming
the basis for such termination and (ii) except in the case of an intentional
and material breach of this Agreement or the Parent Voting Agreement, in the
event that the Parent Termination Fee is paid by Parent pursuant to Section
7.03(a), the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the
Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement), the Transactions (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Action against Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective partners, shareholders, managers, members or Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

(3) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company or
Parent be required to pay to the other party more than one Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, pursuant to Section
7.03(a).

affecting the rights under this Agreement of any holder of Company Shares
making a Cash Election or a Share and CVR Election in comparison to other
holders of Company Shares (disregarding for this purpose any effect
contemplated by clause (b)) or (b) reducing the amount of consideration, or

provision of this Agreement would result in the termination of the Company
Voting Agreement if the prior written consent of CMB or CMIG International
Holdings Pte. Ltd under Section 13(a) of the Voting Agreement was not obtained
with respect to such change, modification or waiver, such change, modification
or waiver, as applicable, shall be null and void unless such proposed change,

privilege. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach.

permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or

Section vi.. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(1) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract, tort or statute)
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement), shall in all respects be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles of such state that
might refer the governance, construction or interpretation of such agreements
to the Laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent the provisions of
the laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to the Merger.

(2) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be
brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts
within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case,
any appellate court therefrom. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Actions and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction
to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue
set forth in this Section 8.06(b) shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees
that service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight
courier at the address set forth in Section 8.09 of this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided, however, that
nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek
any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court
judgment.

Section vii.. Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right of the
Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts described in Section
8.06(b) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right
to specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 8.07 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction.

RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO

VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
