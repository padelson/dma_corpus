promptly after the indemnified party receives notice of the claim or liability being asserted, but
the failure to do so shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability, except to the

defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those
available to the indemnifying party that, if the indemnified party and the indemnifying party were

prejudice the prosecution of the defenses available to such indemnified party, then the indemnified
party shall be entitled, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to participate in the defense
thereof and select its own counsel. Each of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall
