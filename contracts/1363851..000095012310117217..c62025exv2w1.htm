Such amounts shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP, whether or not in accordance with the historical accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methodologies of the Companies, giving effect to any changes or adjustments to the applicable balance sheet items as a result of the Transaction. To the extent that GAAP permits alternate treatments of any item comprising Closing Date Working Capital, the particular treatment used in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements shall also be used in the preparation of the Closing Date Working Capital and Closing Date Indebtedness Amount calculations. 

  

 (b) Upon delivery of such calculations, the Purchaser will provide the Selling Party Representative and its agents and representatives with access to the personnel and the books and records of the Purchaser and the Company to the extent related to the Selling Party Representatives evaluation of the calculations of the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness Amount.

In the event that the Selling Party Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such sixty (60) day period, the Selling Party Representative and the Selling Members shall be deemed to 

   ##### 

  

 

have accepted the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital and the
Closing Date Indebtedness Amount delivered by the Purchaser, which shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, the Purchaser and the Selling
Party Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for a
period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree)
to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness Amount. If the
Purchaser and the Selling Party Representative are unable to resolve
such disagreements within such time period, then, at any time thereafter,
either the Selling Party Representative or the Purchaser may engage the
Auditor to resolve any remaining disagreements. If the Auditor is so engaged,
the Selling Party Representative and the Purchaser shall make, and hereby
agree to make, readily available to the Auditor all relevant personnel and
books and records of the Company and any other documents reasonably necessary
for the Auditor to make its determination under this Section 2.08(b). The
Auditor shall determine as promptly as practicable (i) whether the
Purchasers calculations were prepared in accordance with the standards set
forth in Section 2.08(a) with respect to the remaining disagreements
submitted to the Auditor and whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing
Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness Amount requires
adjustment and (ii) the extent to which each Party prevailed in the dispute
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The determination of the
Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The fees and
expenses of the Auditor pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be borne by the
Purchaser and the Selling Party Representative in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on matters resolved by the Auditor pursuant to clause (ii)
above. The date on which the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing
Date Indebtedness Amount are finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.08 is hereinafter referred as to the "Determination Date." 

   

 (c) The "Adjustment Amount" means an amount (which may be positive or negative) equal to (i) the Closing Consideration as calculated using the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness Amount as determined in accordance with this Section 2.08 in lieu of using the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness Amount, respectively, in accordance with the definition of Closing Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Consideration that formed the basis for the payments at the Closing as determined pursuant to Section 2.02. 

  

 (d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then within five (5) days after the Determination Date the Purchaser shall pay the Adjustment Amount to the Selling Party Representative, to be disbursed to the Selling Parties Pro Rata. 

  

 (e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then within five (5) days after the Determination Date, the Purchaser and the Selling Party Representative shall issue instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (f) The Parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration unless otherwise required by Law.

 Section 2.09 Earn-Out. 

   

 (a) In addition to the Purchase Price, the Selling Parties shall have the opportunity to earn, and the Purchaser shall pay to such Persons, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.09, additional cash proceeds, in an aggregate amount of up to Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000), calculated and determined in the manner set forth in this Section 2.09. 

  

 (b) If Medfusions gross profit together with the gross profit generated by the Purchased Assets as contemplated in paragraph (d)(i) of this Section 2.09 for the twelve (12) month period ending on December 31, 2012 (the "Earn-Out Year") is greater than Thirty-Six Million Dollars ($36,000,000) (the "Gross Profit Target"), Purchaser shall pay a total aggregate amount equal to $5.50 for every $1 of gross profit in excess of the Gross Profit Target, Pro Rata to the Selling Parties, up to a maximum of Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000) in the aggregate (the "Earn-Out Consideration") within 45 days of the final determination of the Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to Section 2.09(c), and deliver to each Selling Party his, her or its Pro Rata share of such Earn-Out Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to the Selling Members wire instructions previously delivered to the Purchaser. 

  

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after December 31, 2012, but in no event later than March 31, 2013, Purchaser shall (i) prepare or cause to be prepared in accordance with GAAP (to the extent that GAAP permits alternate treatments in calculating gross profit, the particular treatment used in the preparation of the historical financial statements of Purchaser shall be used) (A) Medfusions balance sheet and statements of income for the Earn-Out Year, which Purchaser shall cause, at Purchasers expense, to be audited in accordance with GAAP by KPMG LLP (or Purchasers then current audit firm) (collectively, the "Earn-Out Financial Statements"), and (B) a statement (the "Gross Profit Statement") setting forth the amount of gross profit (as set forth in the Earn-Out Financial Statements) and the calculation of the amounts of the Earn-Out Consideration, if any, in reasonable detail (collectively, the "Earn-Out Deliveries"), and (ii) deliver the Earn-Out Deliveries to the Selling Party Representative, on behalf of the Selling Parties. Upon delivery of such calculations, the Purchaser will provide the Selling Party Representative and his agents and representatives with reasonable access to the personnel and the books and records of the Purchaser and Company to the extent related to the Selling Party Representatives evaluation of the Earn-Out Deliveries and related calculations. The Selling Party Representative may dispute the calculation of the Earn-Out Consideration or any element relevant to the calculations of the Earn-Out Consideration by notifying the Purchaser of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, to the extent practicable given the information set forth in the Gross Profit Statement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Earn-Out Deliveries. In the event that the Selling Party Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, the Selling Party Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations of the Earn-Out Consideration, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, the Selling Party Representative may, at his expense, engage a certified independent accounting firm of national reputation to conduct an audit of Medfusion ("Payee Audit"). The Payee Audit shall be conducted during regular business hours of Medfusion and in a manner that does not cause 

   ##### 

  

 

unreasonable disruption to Medfusions or Purchasers business operations. If
the Payee Audit reveals a shortfall in the Earn-Out Consideration of 5% or
more from the Earn-Out Consideration set forth in the Earn-Out Deliveries,
the Selling Party Representative shall direct the accounting firm that has
conducted the Payee Audit to provide the Purchaser with written notice of such
shortfall. The Purchaser shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to
dispute the results of the Payee Audit. If the Purchaser does not dispute the
result of the Payee Audit within such thirty-day period, Purchaser shall make
prompt payment to the Selling Parties of such shortfall and pay or reimburse
all reasonable expenses incurred for the Payee Audit. If Purchaser provides
written notice to the Selling Party Representative within such thirty-day
period to dispute the results of the Payee Audit, the parties shall submit
the matter for binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11.13. 

   

 (d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Earn-Out Consideration is a significant portion of the consideration to be paid in the Transaction and Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees as follows: 

   

 (i) Subject to clause (iv) below of this Section 2.09(d), Purchaser shall operate Medfusion and the Subsidiaries as stand-alone entities from the Closing Date through the end of the Earn-Out Year (it being understood and agreed that the Purchased Assets may be operated by any Affiliate of the Purchaser but any gross profit generated by the Purchased Assets will be tracked and counted as gross profit for purposes of this Section 2.09); 

   

 (ii) To the extent gross profit benefits are realized in the Business as a result of the Transaction or its integration with the Purchaser and its business from the Closing Date through the end of the Earn-Out Year, including incremental discounts from wholesalers and cost reductions from direct purchasing agreements negotiated with manufacturers, the Selling Parties will receive the benefits of those improvements in the calculation of the gross profit for purposes of determining the Earn-Out Consideration; 

   

 (iii) Prior to the transfer of prescriptions filled by Purchaser or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the business of Medfusion for fulfillment, the Selling Party Representative and the Purchaser will mutually agree in good faith and in writing to an appropriate adjustment in the Gross Profit Target to reflect such adjustments in prescription volume; and 

   

 (iv) From the Closing Date through the end of the Earn-Out Year, Purchaser will conduct the Business in a commercially reasonable manner. It is the current intention of the Purchaser that following the Closing Date Medfusion will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser, but nothing herein shall give the Selling Parties any rights to prevent the merger or consolidation of Medfusion into Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser (excluding, for this purpose, Medfusion or the Subsidiaries) or any third Person or any sale, transfer or other disposition of a majority of the equity interests in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, Medfusion and its Subsidiaries to any third Person (each a "Company Change of Control Event"). Upon the occurrence of a Company Change of Control Event between the Closing Date through the end of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Earn-Out Year, the Earn-Out Consideration shall accelerate and be payable in
full Pro Rata to the Selling Parties within twenty (20) days of the
consummation of such Company Change of Control Event. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall support the Business after the Closing in a
commercially reasonable manner that would not as its purpose (i)
cause diminution of the Earn-Out Consideration or (ii) deprive the Selling
Parties of a full and fair opportunity to receive payment of the Earn-Out
Consideration hereunder as is dependent on the performance of the Business. 

  

 Section 2.10 Tax Treatment; Allocation of Closing Consideration and Adjustment Amount. 

   

 (a) Purchaser and the Selling Members agree, for federal income Tax purposes, that the Bayou Check-the-Box Election, Exchange Transaction and sale of the Company Units and Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as follows: (1) in accordance with Treas. Reg. §301.7701-3(c)(1), the Bayou Check-the-Box Election shall be treated as if Bayou State distributed all of its assets and liabilities to its members in liquidation of Bayou State, and immediately thereafter the members contributed all of the distributed assets and liabilities to a newly formed limited liability company taxable as a partnership (in accordance with Treas.

 (b) As soon as practicable after the determination of the Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Selling Party Representative an allocation schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") setting forth Purchasers allocation of the Closing Consideration, Adjustment Amount and liabilities of the Companies (to the extent includible in the cost of the assets of the Companies for income tax purposes) (the "Tax Consideration") to the assets of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, which shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Allocation Schedule shall be subject to the review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Selling Party Representative. 

  

 (c) If the Tax Consideration changes at any time after the Allocation Schedule is prepared by Purchaser and provided to the Selling Party Representative, Purchaser shall prepare and provide to the Selling Party Representative within sixty (60) days after such change a revised Allocation Schedule that reflects the change and is prepared in accordance with Section 2.10(b), which shall be subject to the review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Selling Party Representative. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule shall be resolved in the same manner as disputes are resolved pursuant to Section 2.08(b). The Parties shall promptly advise each other of the existence of any Tax audit or other Action related to the allocation hereunder. 

  

 (e) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, file all Tax Returns consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and the Allocation Schedule. No Selling Party shall file any Tax Return inconsistent with the federal income tax classification after the Closing of Medfusion, Bayou Sate and Medtown North Georgia as entities disregarded as separate from Purchaser.

shall be subject to the review and reasonable approval of the
Purchaser. Medfusion also shall take such other actions in furtherance of

Notwithstanding the sale of the Company Units and the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the Companies agree that neither Companies nor the Purchaser shall have the right to assert the attorney/client privilege as to pre-closing communications between any of the Sellers Agreements or the Companies (for the Companies, only with respect to pre-closing communications), on one hand,

signatories to any of the Sellers Agreement with respect to any of the

the signatories to any of the Sellers Agreements. All other files generated

Each Selling Member acknowledges and agrees that he has acquired valuable knowledge of certain confidential information that constitutes the property of Medfusion and the Subsidiaries solely and exclusively, and which, if lost or used by the Selling Member outside the Business could cause irreparable and continuing injury to the Business for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Each Selling Member further acknowledges and agrees that all records, lists, client lists, files, electronic documents, reports, notes, internal manuals relating to services provided by Medfusion or the Subsidiaries, business plans, compilations or other recorded matter, and copies or reproductions thereof, to the extent relating to the operations of Medfusion and the Subsidiaries made or received by the Selling Member are the exclusive property of Medfusion and the Subsidiaries. Each Selling Member also covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing Date it will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, divulge or make use of any trade secrets or other confidential information of the Business described in this subsection (b) other than to disclose such secrets and information to the Purchaser or its Affiliates.

Such prohibition will include, but not be limited to, (i) the offering of services, products and other deliverables that compete with services, products or deliverables sold or offered for sale by Medfusion or its Subsidiaries, (ii) owning, managing, operating, controlling, participating in or otherwise carrying on a business similar to or competitive with the Business, Medfusion or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the use or license to a third party to use the name "Medtown" in the operation of a business similar to or competitive with the Business, Medfusion or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in connection with the operation of a retail pharmacy with drug dispensing revenue attributable to specialty pharmacy accounting for less than 10% of total drug dispensing revenues (a "Retail Pharmacy"). For purposes of clarity, the restrictions in this Section 6.11(c) shall not apply to the Selling Members (A) involvement in (i) a Retail Pharmacy, (ii) a hospital pharmacy; (iii) pharmaceutical research or clinical trials; (iv) drug manufacturing; or (B) "passive" ownership of an equity interest in AssuranceRx, LLC. 

  

 (d) During the Restricted Period, a Selling Member will not (whether as principal, agent, independent contractor, employee, consultant, representative, investor, manager, security holder, partner or otherwise) directly or indirectly, contact, solicit, divert, take away, induce or attempt to induce any person who is then in the employ of Medfusion or any of its Affiliates, to leave the employ of Medfusion or such Affiliate, or in any way interfere with the relationship between Medfusion or such Affiliate and any of their respective employees, or employ or attempt to employ directly or through another person or entity, any such employee, or approach any such employee for any of the foregoing purposes. This subsection (d) shall not prohibit the use of general advertising or other general solicitation by a Selling Member not targeted to the employees of Medfusion or its Affiliates. 

  

 (e) During the Restricted Period, a Selling Member (whether as principal, agent, independent contractor, employee, consultant, representative, investor, manager, security holder, partner or otherwise) will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, endeavor to solicit, contact, or interfere, contract with, provide services to, or otherwise deal or do business with any Person that: 

   

 (i) is a customer, licensee, sales representative, drug manufacturer, drug wholesaler or payor of Medfusion or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date; or 

   

 (ii) was a customer, licensee, sales representative, drug manufacturer, drug wholesaler or payor of Medfusion or its Subsidiaries at any time within eighteen (18) months prior to the Closing Date; or

provided, however, that the restrictions contained in this subsection (e)
shall not apply to a Selling Members dealings with any drug manufacturer or
drug wholesaler in the conduct of a Retail Pharmacy business. 

   

 (f) During the Restricted Period, a Selling Member (whether as principal, agent, independent contractor, employee, consultant, representative, investor, manager, security holder, partner or otherwise) will not, directly or indirectly, make (or cause to be made) to any Person any disparaging, derogatory or other negative or false statement about Medfusion or the Subsidiaries, the Business, the Purchaser or any of Medfusions or the Purchasers respective Affiliates (including with respect to the products, services, equipment, suppliers, policies, practices, operations, employees, sales representatives, independent contractors, licensees, advisors, agents, officers, security holders, members, managers, partners or directors of any such Person) provided, however, that the restrictions contained in this subsection (f) shall not apply to a Selling Members dealings with any drug manufacturer or drug wholesaler in the conduct of a Retail Pharmacy business. 

  

 (g) Each Selling Member agrees that the services of Medfusion and the Subsidiaries are special and unique, that damages cannot compensate in the event of a violation of the above noncompetition and non-solicitation covenants, and that injunctive relief shall be essential for the protection of Medfusion and the Subsidiaries, the Purchaser and their respective successors and assigns. Accordingly, each Selling Member agrees and consents that, in the event such Selling Member shall violate or breach any of said restrictive covenants, Medfusion and the Subsidiaries shall be entitled to obtain (and such Selling Member hereby consents to) injunctive relief against such Selling Member, without bond, in addition to such further or other relief as may appertain at equity or law. Obtainment of such an injunction by Medfusion or the Subsidiaries shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right by Medfusion or the Subsidiaries to assert any other remedies Medfusion or the Subsidiaries have at law or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from the forbearance or failure by Medfusion or the Subsidiaries to take action hereon. Each Selling Member agrees that if any provisions hereof shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion is to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made; provided, further, to the extent any provision hereof is deemed unenforceable by virtue of its scope in terms of area or length of time, but may be made enforceable by limitations thereon, each Selling Member agrees that the same shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in such jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. 

  

 Section 6.12 Consummation of the Exchange Transaction. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Selling Members (after giving effect to, and assuming the consummation of, the Exchange Transaction) and Medfusion shall consummate the Exchange Transaction to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser and, in connection therewith, Medfusion shall take all actions reasonably necessary to enforce the provisions of the Exchange Agreement.

 Section 6.13 Receivables Matters.

If the Purchaser makes an indemnity claim under Section 9.02(a) as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation contained in Section 4.22(a) with respect to a specific accounts receivable (the "Indemnification Receivables"), any amounts collected with respect to such Indemnification Receivables shall be paid to the Purchaser in satisfaction of such indemnification claim if the Purchaser has not yet been paid with respect to such indemnification claims or, if such indemnification claim has been paid to the Purchaser, shall be distributed to the Selling Party Representative to be paid Pro Rata to the Selling Parties. 

   

 Section 6.14 Medtown South. Medtown South agrees that (i) it shall not, and it shall ensure its owners do not, use or license to a third party to use the name "Medtown" to conduct any business activities following the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, (ii) the closing and shut down of its operations shall occur concurrent with the Closing and shall comply with all applicable Laws and (iii) it shall not, and it shall ensure its owners do not, dissolve Medtown South until the end of the Earn-Out Year.

 (b) No indemnification shall be payable to a Selling Party Indemnified Party with respect to claims under Section 9.04 that are asserted after the applicable Indemnity Period;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if within the applicable Indemnity Period a specific state of facts shall have become known that may give rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 9.04 and a Selling Party Indemnified Party shall have given written notice to the Purchaser of such facts known by such Selling Party Indemnified Party at such time, then the right to indemnification with respect to such claim shall remain in effect without regard to when such matter shall be finally determined and disposed of. 

  

 Section 9.05 Notice; Defense of Claims. An indemnified party may make claims for indemnification hereunder by giving written notice thereof to (a) in the case of claims 

     ##### 

  

    

against the Purchaser, to the Purchaser, and (b) in the case of claims against
the Selling Parties, to the Selling Party Representative, in each case within
the period in which indemnification claims can be made hereunder. If
indemnification is sought for a claim or liability asserted by a third party,
the indemnified party shall also give written notice thereof to the
indemnifying party promptly after the indemnified party receives notice of
the claim or liability being asserted, but the failure to do so shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability, except to the extent that
it is materially prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice.
Such notice shall summarize in reasonable detail the basis for the claim for
indemnification and any claim or liability being asserted by a third party.
The indemnified party shall have the right to assume, conduct and control the
defense of, and compromise or settle such claim (unless the claim is
solely for monetary damages and would not reasonably be expected to affect
the ongoing operation of the Business after the Closing Date in any material
respect in which case the indemnifying party shall have the right to assume,
conduct and control the defense of, and compromise or settle such claim), at
the indemnifying partys cost and expense, by giving written notice (the
"Defense Notice") to the other party of its intention to do so. The
indemnified party shall be entitled, at the expense of the indemnifying
party, to direct the defense against a third party claim or liability
with counsel selected by it (subject to the consent of the indemnifying
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the indemnifying
party has assumed the defense of a third party claim that is solely for
monetary damages and is not reasonably expected to affect the ongoing
operation of the Business after the Closing Date in any material respect, and
the indemnified party determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that there are or may be legal defenses available to the
indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party that, if the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party were to be represented by the same counsel, would constitute a conflict
of interest for such counsel or prejudice the prosecution of the defenses
available to such indemnified party, then the indemnified party shall be
entitled, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to participate in the
defense thereof and select its own counsel. Each of the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party shall at all times have the right to fully participate
in the defense of a third party claim or liability at its own expense
directly or through counsel. If no Defense Notice is given by the
indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the
notice of claim or liability, the indemnifying party shall have the right at
its own expense to undertake the defense of such claim or liability (with
counsel selected by the indemnifying party). If the third party claim
or liability is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely by the
indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall make available such
information and assistance as the indemnifying party may reasonably request
and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense, at
the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article IX, neither the indemnifying party, on the one hand,
nor the indemnified party on the other, may compromise or settle any claim or
liability without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. 

   

 Section 9.06 Escrow. 

   

 (a) With respect to any claim for indemnification arising from an inaccuracy or breach by any Selling Party of his, her or its respective representations and warranties contained in Article III or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or his, her or its respective covenants or agreements in this Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may, at 

   

-60-

##### 

 

  

their option, seek payment of any such indemnification claim from such Selling
Party directly or from the Escrow Fund established pursuant to this Section
9.06. With respect to any other claim for indemnification under Section 9.02,
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall seek payment of any such
indemnification claim or Loss recovery first from the Escrow Fund established
pursuant to this Section 9.06 until it has been depleted. The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall also have the right, exercisable by delivery of
written notice to the Selling Party Representative, to set off against, and
reduce the total amount of any Earn-Out Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder by the amount of any and all Losses to which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified with respect to any breach
by any Selling Party of his, her or its representations and warranties
contained in Article III or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
his, her or its respective covenants in this Agreement. For purposes of
clarity, once a particular Selling Partys Pro Rata portion of the Escrow
Fund has been depleted with respect to Losses for which it is liable, the
Purchaser may not apply portions of the Escrow Fund attributable to other
Selling Parties with respect to such Losses, but must instead seek payment
directly from such Selling Party or through permissible set off. 

   

 (b) If Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02 in excess of the amount of the Escrow Fund, or if the funds in the Escrow Fund are inadequate to reimburse Purchaser Indemnified Parties solely with respect to any and all Losses (i) for which such Purchaser Indemnified Parties are determined to be entitled to indemnification (x) arising from any inaccuracy or breach of a Fundamental Representation or representation or warranty contained in Article III or (y) pursuant to Sections 9.02(b), 9.02(c), 9.02(d), 9.02(e) or 9.02(f) or (ii) attributable to fraud (the matters set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence are referred to collectively as "Excluded Matters"), Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right, solely with respect to any Excluded Matter, to seek recovery of such Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund severally and directly from the Selling Parties. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall also have the right, exercisable by delivery of written notice to the Selling Party Representative, to set off against, and reduce the total amount of any Earn-Out Consideration otherwise payable hereunder by the amount of any and all Losses to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified by a particular Selling Party with respect to any Excluded Matter. 

  

 (c) On the Closing Date, an amount equal to Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) (the "Escrow Fund") shall be deposited by the Purchaser with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), pursuant to the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. The Escrow Fund shall be used to satisfy and pay the Adjustment Amount, if any, as set forth in Section 2.08 and the amount of Losses, if any, for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, on the date which is three Business Days after the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"), the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Selling Parties Pro Rata an amount equal to the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the Escrow Termination Date, if any. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the Escrow Termination Date, any claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party has been made that could result in a Loss that is subject to indemnification pursuant to Article IX hereof, and the Purchaser has notified the Escrow Agent and the Selling Parties of such in writing, and such claim remains unpaid, then there shall be withheld from the distribution to the Selling Parties such amount of the Escrow Fund within the applicable escrow account as is reasonably necessary to cover any such Loss resulting from such pending claim in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and such withheld amount shall either be (i) paid to the Purchaser or (ii) paid to each Selling Party as provided in Section 9.06(c), as determined upon final resolution of such claim or claims in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and Article IX hereof (and the escrow shall be continued in effect until such final resolution of such claim or claims). 

  

 Section 9.07 Other Limitations; Exclusive Remedies. For all purposes under this Article IX, Losses shall be (i) net of any insurance, indemnification or other recoveries actually received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates under any insurance policy or other Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (net of any applicable out-of-pocket collection costs, deductibles and premium adjustments) and (ii) calculated on an "After-Tax Basis," meaning after taking into account (A) all increases in Taxes payable by the indemnified party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment; (B) to the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of the Loss, all increases in Taxes payable by the indemnified party for all affected taxable years and periods as a result of the event giving rise to such Loss (the "Indemnified Event"), and (C) to the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of the such Loss, all reductions in Taxes actually realized by the indemnified party for all affected taxable years or periods as a result of the Indemnified Event. All calculations shall be made based on actual Tax increases and Tax reductions, and shall be paid at the time such actual Tax increase or reductions are actually realized. The Parties agree that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price, unless otherwise required by Law. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no Losses may be claimed under this Article IX by an indemnified party to the extent such Losses relate to any matter which was specifically included in the determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.08; (b) no Party shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive or similar exemplary damages, except to the extent actually paid to a third party; (c) no indemnified party shall be entitled to a "double" recovery arising out of the same facts or circumstances; and (d) if the Closing occurs, the provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole recourse and remedy of the parties hereto (except with respect to any equitable remedy to which a party may be entitled or fraud), or any Affiliate of any thereof, for any breach, misrepresentation or other matters under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.08 Selling Party Representative. 

   

 (a) Ron Cunningham is hereby appointed by the Selling Parties as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each of the Selling Parties (the "Selling Party Representative"), to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate and enter into settlements and compromises of claims, to demand, prosecute and defend claims arising out of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to comply with orders of courts and determinations and awards with respect to claims, and to take all actions necessary or 

   ##### 

  

 

appropriate in the judgment of the Selling Party Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the consent of
the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Escrow Account from time to time
upon not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to the
Purchaser. Any vacancy in the position of Selling Party Representative shall
be filled by the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Escrow Account. The
Selling Party Representative may resign upon thirty (30) calendar days prior
written notice to the Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
Selling Party Representative. No bond shall be required of the Selling
Party Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Selling Party
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each Selling Party. 

   

 (b) The Selling Party Representative shall not have any liability for any damages to the Selling Parties for any action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as Selling Party Representative, except as caused by the Selling Party Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Selling Party Representative may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and the Selling Party Representative shall not be liable to the Selling Parties for anything done, omitted or suffered by the Selling Party Representative based on such advice. The Selling Party Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Selling Party Representative. 

  

 (c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Selling Party Representative shall be deemed to have been taken or given on behalf of all the Selling Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all Selling Parties, and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Selling Party Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of, and binding on, each of the Selling Parties. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and their respective representatives are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Selling Party Representative. 

  

 (d) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deposit Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "Selling Party Representative Account Fund") into an interest-bearing account in the name of the Selling Party Representative for the benefit of the Selling Parties (the "Selling Party Representative Account"). Subject to Section 9.08(b), the Selling Party Representative Account Fund shall remain in the Selling Party Representative Account up to the later of the Escrow Termination Date or the date that all disputes, if any, between the Selling Party Representative and the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement have been resolved (such later date, the "Selling Party Representative Account Release Date"). The Selling Party Representative shall be entitled to reasonable compensation on an hourly basis and reimbursement of all expenses incurred in connection with his, her or its services as the Selling Party Representative hereunder. The Selling Parties hereby agree to contribution upon demand their Pro Rata share of costs and expenses of the Selling Party Representative in excess of the Selling Party Representative Account Fund. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the Selling Party Representative is authorized to draw upon the Selling Party 

   ##### 

  

 

Representative Account to pay expenses as it deems, in good faith, to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the defense of indemnity claims,
or the enforcement of rights under this Agreement, on behalf of the Selling
Parties, and such other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Payment of
the Selling Party Representative Account Fund on the Selling Party
Representative Account Release Date shall be made to the Selling Parties Pro
Rata, as determined by the portion of the Closing Consideration withheld from
each Selling Party in establishing the Selling Party Representative Account
Fund. 

   

 (f) The Selling Party Representative represents and warrants that: 

   

 (i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Selling Party Representative and the consummation by the Selling Party Representative of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary Selling Party Representative action on the part of the Selling Party Representative; 

   

 (ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Selling Party Representative and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, the Selling Members and the Companies, and binding effect of this Agreement on the Purchaser, the Selling Members and the Companies) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Selling Party Representative, enforceable against the Selling Party Representative in accordance with its terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies; and 

   

 (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Selling Party Representative does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, any Contract to which the Selling Party Representative is a party or by which any of its material assets is bound. 

  

 Section 9.09 Release. As of the Closing Date, each Selling Member, on behalf of such Selling Member and each of such Selling Members Affiliates, hereby releases and forever discharges Purchaser, the Companies and each Subsidiary, and each of their respective individual, joint or mutual, past, present and future representatives, members, managers, controlling persons, successors and assigns (individually, a "Releasee" and collectively, "Releasees") from any and all claims, demands, proceedings, Actions, causes of action, judgments, obligations, Contracts and Liabilities of any nature that each of the Selling Members or any of their respective Affiliates now have, have ever had or may hereafter have against the respective Releasees arising contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date or on account of or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or before the Closing Date, including any rights to indemnification or reimbursement from the Companies or any Subsidiary, whether pursuant to their respective Organizational Instruments, Contract or otherwise and whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 9.09 shall operate to release (i) any 

      ##### 

  

    

obligations of Purchaser arising under this Agreement or any Purchaser
Agreement, (ii) accrued but unpaid salary as reflected in the records of the
Companies as of the Closing, (iii) any accrued benefits under the Benefit
Plans, or (iv) any unreimbursed business expenses of such Selling Member.
Each Selling Member hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or
causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind against any Releasee, based
upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

 Section 11.03 Public Announcement. Except as may be required by Law, no party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the Transaction or otherwise communicate with any news media without prior consent of the other parties, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by Law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; _provided_  that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with accounting and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations. 

   

 Section 11.04 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 11.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 Section 11.07 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of the Purchaser without the prior written consent of any other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall limit or affect the Purchasers obligations hereunder, which shall remain primary. Following the Closing, the Purchaser may freely assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under Article IX), in whole or in part, to any other Person without obtaining the consent or approval of any other party hereto or of any other Person. 

   

 Section 11.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Selling Party Representative shall be the third party beneficiary of the Selling Members, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Selling Member Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of Article IX, and the signatories to any of the Sellers Agreements not a signatory to this Agreement shall be a third party beneficiary of Section 6.09.

 Section 11.10 Sections and Schedules. Any disclosure of any information in a particular Section or Subsection of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section or Subsection of Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent on its face. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 11.11 Further Assurances. 

   

 (a) Each party agrees (i) to furnish upon request to each other party such further information, (ii) to execute and deliver to each other party such other documents, and (iii) to do such other acts and things, all as another party may reasonably request, for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement, including vesting of legal and beneficial ownership of all the Company Units and the Purchased Assets, directly or indirectly, in the Purchaser. 

  

 (b) If, prior to the Closing, all necessary approvals, consents and waivers are not obtained with respect to any Assumed Medtown South Contracts or any other Purchased Asset and the Purchaser receives the claims, rights and benefits of Medtown South arising under any such Assumed Medtown South Contract or any other Purchased Asset or resulting therefrom after the Closing Date (but not such Assumed Medtown South Contract or Purchased Asset itself), then, in each such case (to the maximum extent permitted by Law or any applicable Assumed Medtown South Contract or Purchased Asset), the Purchaser shall be responsible for the obligations and liabilities of Medtown South under such Assumed Medtown South Contract or Purchased Asset after the Closing Date (but not such Assumed Medtown South Contract or Purchased Asset itself) relating solely to the period after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Assets if an attempted assignment thereof without the consent of a third party thereto would constitute a breach thereof. 

  

 Section 11.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of law principles. 

   

 Section 11.13 Dispute Resolution. 

   

 (a) _Dispute_. Any controversy, claim or dispute of whatever nature, including claims for fraud in the inducement and disputes as to arbitrability, arising between the Companies (prior to the Closing Date) or any Selling Party (before or after the Closing Date) or the Selling Party Representative (after the Closing Date), on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand (each, a "Disputing Party") under this Agreement, including those arising out of or relating to the breach, termination, enforceability, scope, validity, or making of this Agreement, whether such claim existed prior to or arises on or after the Closing Date (a "Dispute"), shall be resolved by good faith negotiations among the Disputing Parties, such negotiation not to exceed a period of thirty (30) consecutive days (the "Negotiation Period"). In the event a Dispute remains unresolved following the Negotiation Period, such Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration, unless the Disputing Parties otherwise agree. The agreement to arbitrate contained in this section shall continue in full force and effect despite the expiration, rescission or termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Arbitration; Submission to Jurisdiction_. Either Disputing Party may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement by giving a written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to the other Disputing Party setting forth the nature of the Dispute. The Dispute shall be determined by binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution ("CPR") Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration ("CPR Rules"), 

   ##### 

  

 

subject to any modifications contained in this Agreement. The Dispute shall be
determined by a single, neutral arbitrator, except that if the Dispute
involves an amount in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)
(exclusive of interest and costs), three arbitrators shall be appointed. The
Disputing Parties shall agree upon the arbitrator(s) within the (10) Business
Days after receipt of a Dispute Notice. Each arbitrator shall be a retired
state or federal judge or an attorney with at least fifteen (15) years of
business litigation experience. If the Disputing Parties are unable to agree
upon the arbitrator(s) within such period, the arbitrator(s) shall
be selected by CPR in accordance with the CPR Rules. An award shall be made
by a majority of the arbitrators. The arbitrator(s) shall base the award on
the "four corners" of the Agreement, and only when the answer to a Dispute is
not contained therein, shall the arbitrator(s) look to the governing law
designated herein and judicial precedent in accordance with the terms hereof
to resolve the Dispute. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to give the arbitrator(s) any authority, power or
right to change, modify, add to or subtract from this Agreement (except as
expressly provided herein). 

    

 (i) The arbitrators shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including equitable remedies, rescission, specific performance of any obligation created under the Agreement, the issuance of an injunction, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse or frustration of the arbitration process. Without limiting either Partys rights under Article IX of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) shall award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator(s), all of such partys reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or asserting any claim, action, suit or proceeding incident to any matter hereunder (including court filing fees, court costs, arbitration fees or costs, witness fees, reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel, investigations, expert witnesses, consultants, accountants, valuation experts and other professional). 

   

 (ii) Discovery will be limited to an exchange of relevant documents and answers to interrogatories. Interrogatories shall, absent permission from the arbitrator(s), be limited to identification of individuals, entities and time periods related to the Dispute, and should not require exhaustive answers or fact finding. Depositions will not be taken except as needed in lieu of a live appearance and only if the arbitrator(s) determine that a witness is not available to testify at the hearing. The arbitrator(s) shall resolve any discovery disputes. The arbitrator(s) and counsel of record will have the power of subpoena process as provided by Law. The Disputing Parties knowingly and voluntarily waive their rights to have any Dispute tried and adjudicated by a judge or a jury. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute Resolution provision. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 

   

 (iv) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, rule or regulation or in court proceedings to enforce this Agreement or an award rendered hereunder or to obtain interim relief, the Disputing Parties and the arbitrator(s) agree to 

   ##### 

  

   

keep confidential and not disclose to third parties any information or
documents obtained in connection with the arbitration process, including the
resolution of the Dispute. If either Disputing Party fails to proceed with
arbitration as provided in this Agreement, or unsuccessfully seeks to stay
the arbitration, or fails to comply with the arbitration award, or is
unsuccessful in vacating or modifying the award pursuant to a petition
or application for judicial review, the other Disputing Party shall be
entitled to be awarded Expenses paid or incurred in successfully compelling
such arbitration or defending against the attempt to stay, vacate or modify
such arbitration award and/or successfully defending or enforcing the
award. 

   

 (v) Each of the Disputing Parties hereto irrevocably submits in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to, and permitted by, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby to the non-exclusive jurisdiction (including personal jurisdiction) and venue of the Federal and state courts in the State of Delaware, and each party waives any and all objections to such Delaware court jurisdiction and venue. 

   

 (vi) Either party may, without inconsistency with this Dispute Resolution provision, apply at any time to any court having jurisdiction and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. 

  

 Section 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier or PDF shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 11.15 No Presumption. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted. 

   

 Section 11.16 Legal Counsel. Morrison has served as legal counsel to Medfusion in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the Seller Agreements. Morrison has not been engaged to protect or represent the interests of any Selling Member, Bayou State or Medtown North Georgia in the preparation of this Agreement or the Seller Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Selling Member further: (i) acknowledges that actual and potential conflicts of interest exist among the Selling Members, (ii) acknowledges and agrees that such Selling Members interests will not be represented by legal counsel unless such Selling Member engages counsel on its own behalf, and that such Selling Member has been urged to and afforded the opportunity to engage and seek the advice of its own legal and tax counsel before entering into this Agreement and the Seller Agreements, (iii) agrees that, in the event of a dispute between one of more of the Selling Members, on one hand, and Medfusion or the other Selling Members on the other hand, Morrison may represent Medfusion, and (iv) represents that such Selling Member has a level of knowledge and sophistication (either alone or with the assistance of its own counsel) necessary to provide its 

      ##### 

  

    

informed consent to the provisions of this Section 11.16 without additional
guidance or information from Morrison or Medfusion. Finally, each Selling
Member agrees that (i) neither this Agreement nor the Transaction
contemplated hereby are intended to create an attorney/client relationship
between Morrison and such Selling Member or any other relationship pursuant
to which such Selling Member (acting other than in the name of Medfusion)
would have the right to object to Morrisons representation of any Person
under any circumstances; and (ii) except as otherwise specifically agreed by
Morrison in writing, no subsequent attorney/client or other relationship
between Morrison and such Selling Member shall give such Selling Member a
right to object to Morrisons continuing role as counsel to Medfusion.
