Section 2.05. Purchase Price Adjustments.

  

(a) Estimated Working Capital. At least five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Shareholder Representative will deliver to Buyer its
preliminary draft of a written statement (the "Pre-Closing
Statement") containing Sellers good faith estimate of (i) Closing Working
Capital as of the expected Closing Date (the "Estimated Working Capital");
and (ii) the Estimated Cash, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the
Estimated Transaction Expenses. All aspects of the Pre-Closing Statement will
be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the
historical accounting policies and practices used by the Company and the
terms of this Agreement. Buyer may discuss with Seller any aspect of the Pre-
Closing Statement prior to Closing. The final Pre-Closing Statement will be
delivered by the Shareholder Representative to Buyer at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. In furtherance of the preparation of the Pre-
Closing Statement and the determination of Estimated Working Capital, the
Company agrees to complete, during the course of the weekend immediately
preceding the contemplated Closing Date (provided that Buyer has provided the
Company written notice of the contemplated Closing Date at least five
Business Days prior to the Friday of such weekend): (i) a physical inventory
count of finished goods, raw material, spare parts, and owned inventory at
co-packers of the Company and (ii) normal cycle procedures on all other
inventory, in each case, to be observed by the Companys outside auditors. If
requested by Buyer, one or more Representatives of Buyer may also
observe such count and procedures, at Buyer\'s expense. Solely for purposes
of calculating the Closing Working Capital under this Agreement, the value of
the inventory on the Closing Date shall equal the value of the usable and
saleable inventory of the Company (i) excluding any obsolete items consistent
with the Company\'s past practices, (ii) based on the results of the counts
described in this Section and (iii) valued at Company\'s cost of such
inventory. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence does not apply
for the allocation of purchase price as set forth in Section 6.14(g).

 

(b) Buyers Post-Closing Final Statement. By the 75th day after the
Closing Date (or, if such 75th day is not a Business Day, the first Business
Day thereafter), Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Shareholder
Representative a written statement (the "Final Statement") setting forth
Buyers determination of Closing Working Capital which will be in form
(including each item) consistent with and in accordance with the illustration
of the Closing Working Capital set forth on Schedule 1.01(b) and each of the
Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the
historical accounting policies and practices used by the Company
but including normal and recurring adjustments as if made at year-end and
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of this Agreement.
The Shareholder Representative will cooperate with Buyer and its
respective Representatives in good faith and in all reasonable respects as
may be requested by Buyer in preparing the Final Statement. The Shareholder
Representative will give Buyer and its

   

Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice to any relevant books and records of Seller for
purposes of completing the matters contemplated in this  **Section 2.05**.

 

(c) Shareholder Representatives Response to the Final Statement. The Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses
set forth in the Final Statement will become final and binding upon the
parties (and become the "Final Working Capital", the "Final Closing Cash",
the "Final Closing Indebtedness", and the "Final Transaction Expenses,"
respectively) 45 days after Buyer gives the Final Statement to the
Shareholder Representative, unless the Shareholder Representative gives
written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Buyer
before the end of such 45-day period. The Notice of Disagreement shall
contain reasonable detail (including the disputed items and amounts (the
"Disputed Items"), proposed correcting adjustments and the reasons for such
adjustments). Buyer will give the Shareholder Representative and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice to any relevant books and records of the Company
for purposes of completing the matters contemplated in this Section 2.05(c),
_provided that_ such access will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with normal operations of Buyer and its Affiliates. If
the Shareholder Representative gives a Notice of Disagreement before the end
of such 45-day period stated above, then the Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses set forth in the Final
Statement will become final and binding upon the parties (and become the
Final Working Capital, the Final Closing Cash, the Final Closing Indebtedness
and the Final Transaction Expenses) upon the earlier of (i) the date the
parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
Disputed Items identified in such Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the date any
Disputed Items are finally resolved in writing by Deloitte, or such
other independent public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
the Shareholder Representative in writing (the "Arbitrator"). Any item or
amount in the Final Statement that is not a Disputed Item will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties in the manner stated in the Final
Statement.

 

(d) Resolving Matters in Notice of Disagreement. During the 20-day period
after a valid Notice of Disagreement is given, the Shareholder Representative
and Buyer will attempt in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
that they have regarding any Disputed Item; provided that such negotiations
will not be communicated to the Arbitrator. If, at the end of such 20-day
period, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer have not reached agreement
on all such Disputed Items, either the Shareholder Representative or Buyer
may require the items that remain in dispute to be submitted to the
Arbitrator for review and resolution as an expert. Shareholder Representative
and Buyer will collectively engage the Arbitrator and will enter into an
engagement letter with the Arbitrator promptly after retention on terms
reasonably agreeable by the Shareholder Representative and Buyer, which will
include customary indemnification, confidentiality and other provisions
proposed by the Arbitrator. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative will
direct the Arbitrator to render a determination within 60 calendar days of
its retention. Each of Buyer and the Shareholder Representative will provide
Arbitrator with all of its respective working papers and supporting materials
reasonably applicable to the remaining Disputed Items. The Shareholder
Representative and Buyer will instruct the Arbitrator to limit its review and
determination to those Disputed Items that remain in dispute, and to deliver
a written report containing its calculations of each such Disputed Item. The
final determination of

    

the Arbitrator will be made in strict accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including the definition of Closing Working Capital as calculated
consistent with Schedule 1.01(b) and GAAP. The Arbitrator will render its
written report resolving such Disputed Items as soon as possible after
completion of written submissions to the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator will
determine the items in dispute solely based on written submissions made by
Shareholder Representative and Buyer (and their respective Representatives)
consistent with the terms of this Agreement (and not by independent review)
which submissions, respectively, will be submitted to the Arbitrator and the
other party within 20 days after the Arbitrator is engaged. None of the
Shareholder Representative, Buyer or their respective Representatives will
have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Arbitrator concerning
the subject matter to be decided without the prior written consent of the
Buyer (in the case of the Shareholder Representative or his Representatives)
or the Shareholder Representative (in the case of Buyer or its
Representatives). The Arbitrator will not assign a value to any Disputed Item
that is greater than the greater value for such Disputed Item claimed by
either party in its written submission or less than the lesser value for such
item claimed by either party in its written submission. The
remaining Disputed Items resolved pursuant to a final written report of the
Arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties absent
manifest error.

 

(e) Allocation of Fees and Expenses. The costs and expenses payable to the
Arbitrator shall be borne by the parties as awarded by the Arbitrator in
proportion as to which the Arbitrator finds that each party prevails with
respect to the disputed matters. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator
incurred pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be included in such costs and
expenses. If a retainer is required by the Arbitrator, the retainer shall be
split equally between Shareholder Representative (on behalf of Seller) and
Buyer; provided, however, that the retainer shall be considered part of the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and if either Shareholder Representative
or Buyer has paid a portion of such retainer, such party shall be entitled to
be reimbursed by the other party to the extent required by this subsection.

 

(f) Reconciliation Payments and Escrow Release. After the amount of Final
Working Capital is finally determined, to the extent the net amount of the
adjustments as finally calculated differs by more than $100,000 from the net
amount used at Closing based on the Pre-Closing Statement, (i) in the case of
a positive adjustment, Buyer will pay Seller (for distribution to the
Shareholders) the full amount of the difference so that the adjustment will
have been made based on Final Working Capital as finally determined and, in
addition to the payment of such difference by Buyer, Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative will instruct the Escrow Agent to release and pay
the amount of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account to Seller, and (ii) in
the case of a negative adjustment, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative
will direct the Escrow Agent to pay Buyer on behalf of Seller the full amount
of the difference so that the adjustment will have been made based on Final
Working Capital as finally determined and the balance of the amount of the
Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account, if any, will be released and paid to
Seller, and in the event of either (i) or (ii) above each party will take any
and all actions necessary to effectuate such release. To the extent the
amount of the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account is insufficient to satisfy
the full amount due to Buyer from Seller under this Section 2.05(f), each
Shareholder shall pay its Pro Rata Share of the excess to Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer.
Any payments to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05(f) will be made by
Buyer, Shareholders or Escrow Agent, as applicable, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated

   

by Buyer or the Shareholder Representative, as applicable, within five
Business Days after Final Working Capital becomes final and binding on the
parties, and, in the case of payments to be made to Seller, shall be paid to
Seller in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.06. Tax Treatment of Payments.

 

(a) Any payment made with respect to a purchase price adjustment under
Section 2.02 or Section 2.05 shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
purposes to the extent required or permitted under the Laws of the governing
jurisdiction.

 

(b) The Shareholder Representative, Buyer and the Company, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to Seller such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, however, Buyer shall
provide written notice to Seller of its intent to so deduct and withhold at
least five days before making any such deduction or withholding and shall
cooperate with any reasonable request by Seller to obtain reduction of or
relief from such deduction and withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, (i) such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to Seller in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made, and (ii) the Shareholder Representative, Buyer or the Company, as
applicable, shall provide to Seller written notice of the amounts so deducted
or withheld.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, in Section 6.01 of the Disclosure Schedules, the
Transaction Documents, or upon providing Buyer with fifteen (15) Business
Days prior written notice of any such action, which notice shall be subject
to objection by Buyer (it being understood that if Buyer does not provide the

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon providing Buyer with
fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice of any such action, which

expiration of such fifteen (15) Business Day period, then such action will be
considered in the ordinary course of business), none of the Shareholders, or
after the Restructuring the Seller, shall cause or permit the Company to take
any action that would cause any of the changes, events or conditions
described in Section 4.07 to occur, except in the ordinary course of business
or as contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ that prior to Closing the
Company may make cash distributions to Shareholders, or after the
Restructuring the Seller, in respect of amounts relating to federal and state
income Taxes of the Shareholders or the Seller that arise by virtue of their
ownership of the Company.

 

(c) Until the Closing, the Company shall:

 

(i) on any damage, destruction or loss to any material asset, apply any and
all insurance proceeds received with respect thereto to the prompt repair,
replacement and restoration thereof to the condition of such asset before
such event or, if required, to such better condition as may be required by
Law;

 

(ii) (A) pay outstanding accounts payable (including outstanding invoices

faith from time to time on a regular basis as agreed with Buyer and
the Representatives of Buyer to report material operational developments and
the general status of ongoing material operations pursuant to procedures
reasonably requested by Buyer or such Representatives. The Company,

consultation shall not constitute a waiver by Buyer of any rights it may have
under this Agreement.

 

(e) _Insurance_. The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, all insurance
policies set forth on Section 4.12 of the Disclosure Schedule, or suitable
replacements thereof, in full force and effect through the close of business

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge
and agree that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys
operations for purposes of the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law
prior to the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law waiting period, or prior to
receipt of any applicable approval under any antitrust or competition Law;
and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no consent of Buyer will be required with respect to any matter
set forth in this Agreement to the extent the requirement of such consent
would violate any applicable Law.

 

Section 6.02. Access to Information and Employees.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Shareholders, and after the
Restructuring the Seller, shall, and shall cause the Company to: (a) afford
Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to and the right to inspect
all of the Real Property, properties, assets, premises, books and records,

(b) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such financial, operating and
other data and information related to the Company as Buyer or any of its

of the Company to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Company;
_provided, however, _ that any such investigation shall be conducted during

interfere with the normal operations of the Company. All requests by Buyer
for access pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be submitted or directed
exclusively to Jonathan Gehrs or such other individuals as the Company may
designate in writing from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company, Seller, or any Shareholder
shall be required to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure
would, in the Companys sole discretion: (x) cause significant competitive
harm to any Shareholder, Seller, the Company or its business if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, to the
extent permitted by Law; (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
privilege; or (z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be
withheld for any reason, Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or
customers or Employees of, the Company and Buyer shall have no right to
perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the Real Property.

   

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall restrict the Company from
contacting and dealing with its suppliers and clients in the ordinary course
of business. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to any access or
information provided pursuant to this Section 6.02.

Section 6.03. Notification of Certain Matters. Until the Closing Date, each
of the Company, Shareholders, and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other of: (a) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event since the date hereof, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
respect at or prior to the Closing (as though given on the Closing Date or as
of the Closing), and (b) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Any disclosure in a Schedule
Supplement under this Section 6.03 pertaining to matters first arising or
first reasonably becoming known after the date hereof, shall not in any way
(x) be included or affect the determination of whether the failure of
conditions to such party\'s obligations to consummate the transactions set
forth in Sections 7.02 or 7.03, as applicable, have been fulfilled or
satisfied, or (y) limit any partys right to termination set forth in
Sections 9.01(b) and 9.01(c). For the avoidance of doubt, following
the Closing Date, the sole remedy of all Persons (including the Indemnified
Parties) for a breach of this Section 6.03 shall be to make a claim
for indemnification for the breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III, Article IV and
Article V of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, and no Person
(including any Indemnified Party) shall be permitted to or shall make any
claim under this Agreement, including Article VIII, for breach of this
Section 6.03.

 

Section 6.04. Resignations. The Company shall deliver to Buyer written
resignations and releases effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers
and directors of the Company requested by Buyer at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.05. Employees; Benefit Plans. From the Closing until the one-year
anniversary of the Closing, as soon as reasonably practicable following
Closing, Buyer shall provide each Employee with employee benefits
(not including salary, wages and/or bonuses) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate as those offered to similarly situated employees
of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall retain the right at any
time during such one-year period to terminate the employment of any Employee,
with or without cause. No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit the right of
Buyer, Shareholders, Seller or their respective Affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any such employee benefit plan.

 

Section 6.06. Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. Prior to and through the
Closing Date, the Company shall not take any action that could create
liability under the WARN Act.

   

Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for complying with and
any liabilities associated with the WARN Act.

 

Section 6.07. Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company, as provided in the
articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 6.07(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

 

(b) For the benefit of the Companys directors and officers, the Company
shall obtain, as of the Closing Date, "tail" insurance policies with a claims
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with coverage and amounts that
are equivalent, and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than the Companys existing policy, to the directors and
officers of the Company, in each case with respect to claims arising out of
or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). For purposes of this Agreement, the expense of such tail
insurance shall be split equally between Buyer and Seller and the Sellers
portion shall be treated as a Transaction Expense deducted from the Purchase
Price. 

 

(c) The obligations the Company under this Section 6.07 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director
or officer to whom this Section 6.07 applies without the consent of such
affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that the directors
and officers to whom this Section 6.07 applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.07, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.07).

 

(d) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.07.

 

Section 6.08. Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, information provided to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this Section
6.08 shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 

Section 6.09. Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from all 

   

Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations
pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other
party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully
take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.
If required by the HSR Act, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement within ten Business Days after the date hereof and to
supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act.

 

(b) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents under the
HSR Act, or if any action is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document as violative
of the HSR Act, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to try to
promptly resolve such objections. Notwithstanding the foregoing and, for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates be under any
obligation to take any of the following actions to resolve any such
objections: (i) agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses
or properties or assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates and any of the
assets of the Company, (ii) terminating any existing relationships
and contractual rights and obligations, (iii) terminating any joint venture
or other arrangement, (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (v) effectuating any other
change or restructuring of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (vi) agreeing to
any limitation to or modification of any of the businesses or assets of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or following the Closing of Buyer, its Affiliates
and/or the Company, and/or (vii) opposing (A) any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding that is initiated or threatened to be initiated
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and/or (B) any request for, the entry of, and seek to
have vacated or terminated, any order that could restrain, prevent or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including in the
case of either (A) or (B) by defending through litigation any action asserted
by any Person in any court or before any Governmental Authority, and/or
pursuing available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal (and, in
each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing), in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order
that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between Seller, any Shareholder or the Company with Governmental Authorities
in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by
Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed
to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or
attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any

   

such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to
the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or
contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the
other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact.

 

(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
Section 4.04 of the Disclosure Schedules. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all
third parties that are described in Section 5.02 of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

(e) Buyer shall furnish to Shareholder Representative a draft of the initial
filing, report or disclosure of Buyer under the U.S. securities laws or any
national securities exchange rules relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to
their release and provide Shareholder Representative the opportunity during
such period to review and comment on such filings, reports or disclosures.
Shareholder Representative shall be furnished with a draft of and be provided
with the opportunity to review and comment on any subsequent filing, report
or disclosure containing information relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein if such information is materially different
from the initial filing, report or disclosure. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.09 shall prevent any party from (a) at any time furnishing any
information to any Governmental Authority or from making any disclosures
required under U.S. securities laws, or under the rules and regulations of
any national securities exchange on which such partys shares of capital
stock are listed or (b) furnishing any information concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such partys Representatives,
subject to the confidentiality obligations hereunder.

 

Section 6.10. Books and Records.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Seller or any Shareholder relating to the period before Closing,
or for any other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years after the
Closing, Buyer shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent
with practices of Buyer; and 

 

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Seller or any
Shareholder reasonable access (including the right to make, at that Sellers
or Shareholders expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to such
books and records,  _provided, that_ such access shall be in a manner that
does not interfere with the normal business operations of Buyer or the
Company. 

 

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by Buyer or the Company relating to the period after Closing, or for
any other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years following the
Closing, Seller and each Shareholder shall: 

   

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of such
Shareholder or Seller which relate to the Company and its operations for
periods prior to the Closing; and 

  

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Buyer or the
Company reasonable access (including the right to make, at Buyers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

 

(c) None of Buyer, Seller, or any Shareholder shall be obligated to provide
the other party with access to any books or records (including personnel
files) pursuant to this Section 6.10 where such access would violate any
Law. 

 

Section 6.11. Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing,
each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof.

 

Section 6.12. Public Announcements. Except as set forth in Section 6.09(e),
unless otherwise required by applicable Law or stock exchange requirements
(based upon the reasonable advice of counsel), no party to this Agreement
shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to
the timing and contents of any such announcement. Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative will consult with each other concerning the means by which
Employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Company will
be informed of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if at all,
and Buyer will have the right to be present for any such communication.

 

Section 6.13. Further Assurances. Following the execution of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances
and assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required
to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.14. Tax Matters. As set forth in this Section 6.14, the
Shareholder Representative shall procedurally act on behalf of and for the
benefit of Seller and the Shareholders, with Seller and Shareholders
remaining liable for all payments hereunder:

 

(a) Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. Parties acknowledge that as a result of
the Restructuring, Seller will be a continuation of the Company for federal
income tax purposes, and its tax year will not end on the date of the sale.
Seller shall cause to be timely prepared and filed all income Tax Returns of
the Seller. To the extent such Tax Returns include the impact of the sale of
the LLC Interests, the Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past custom and practice of the Company in preparing its Tax Returns
except as required by applicable Law, and shall take into account the sale of
the LLC Interests. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at least 30 Business Days
before its due date (taking into account applicable extensions), for Buyer\'s
review, its proposed income Tax Returns that include the sale of the LLC
Interests. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer\'s right of review does not
include a right to disagree and

   

submit unresolved disagreements to the Arbitrator. Seller shall provide Buyer
with a copy of such income Tax Returns as finally filed within 60 Business
Days after filing.

  

(b) Other Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared all
(i) all non-income Tax Returns of the LLC that are to be filed after the
Closing Date, and (ii) all Tax Returns of the LLC for all periods beginning
on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
past custom and practice of the Company in preparing its Tax Returns except
as required by applicable Law. Buyer shall deliver each such Tax Return to
Seller at least 20 Business Days prior to its due date (taking into account
applicable extensions) for Sellers review and approval. In the event Seller
requests revisions to any such Tax Return within ten Business Days of receipt
thereof, and Buyer disagrees with any such revisions, the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement, failing which
the disagreement shall be submitted to the Arbitrator for resolution (the
expenses of which shall be shared in a manner similar to that set forth
in Section 2.05(e)) at least five Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Return is due (taking into account applicable extensions). Buyer shall timely
file (taking into account applicable extensions) such Tax Returns as finally
prepared pursuant to this Section 6.14(b). If the Arbitrator does not resolve
the disagreement by such date, the Tax Return shall be timely filed in
accordance with Buyer\'s position and, if the Arbitrator subsequently
resolves such disagreement in accordance with Seller\'s position, Seller and
Buyer shall amend such Tax Return to reflect the Arbitrator\'s
final resolution. Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, an amount of Taxes
owed with respect to such Tax Returns equal to: (A) in the case of a Pre-
Closing Tax Return, all Taxes owed with respect to such Tax Returns, and (B)
in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes which relates to
the portion of such taxable period occurring on or before the Closing Date
determined pursuant to Section 6.14(a); _provided, however_ , that Seller
shall pay not pay any particular amount of Tax pursuant to this sentence to
the extent the Tax is taken into account in determining Final Working
Capital. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid such amounts of Taxes within
five Business Days of receiving demand therefor from Buyer.

 

(c) Allocation.

 

(i) The Seller will report all income, gain, deduction and loss from the
operation and sale of the Company through and including the Closing Date,
including the impact of the sale of the LLC Interests. The Buyer will report
all such income, gain, deduction and loss with respect to the Company after
the Closing Date. If the Company is permitted but not required under
applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period,
then the parties shall treat that day as the last day of a taxable period.

 

(ii) In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are
payable for a Straddle Period the portion of such Tax which relates to the
portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the
case of any Taxes, other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts or expenses (e.g., payroll Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period, and (B) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income,
receipts or expenses, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant taxable period ended as of the end of the Closing Date; 
_provided,_

   

 _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
apportioned between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and
the portion of the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each such period.

 

(iii) The parties agree that Transaction Tax Deductions shall, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, be considered to arise in the taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date and the provisions of
this Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
therewith.

 

(d) Buyer Covenants. Without the prior written consent of Seller, which is
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and except
as required by Law, Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company or any of
its Affiliates to: (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any Pre
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii) make or revoke any Tax election
that has retroactive effect to any Pre Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period;
or (iii) extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect to a Tax for
Pre Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

 

(e) Tax Contests.

 

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the LLC a written notice of its
intent to audit or conduct another legal proceeding with respect to the
income Taxes, or an income Tax Return, of the Company, the LLC or the Seller
for a period ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Tax Claim"), the Buyer
shall notify the Seller of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Authority within thirty (30) days of receipt. No failure or
delay of the Buyer in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Seller under this
Agreement, except to the extent that such failure or delay adversely affects
the ability of the Seller to contest such Tax Claim.

 

(ii) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall control any Tax Claim
provided, (i) the Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding
the status of such Tax Claim; (ii) the Seller shall control such contest in
good faith; (iii) the Buyer shall have the right at its expense to
participate, or cause the Company or its Affiliates to participate, in such
Tax Contest; and (iv) the Seller shall not settle, resolve, or abandon (and
shall not allow the Company or its applicable Affiliates to settle, resolve,
or abandon) such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

 

(f) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The parties shall, and shall each cause
their Affiliates to, provide to the other such cooperation and information,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns, determining liability for Taxes, and any audit or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns, Tax liability, or
audit or other proceeding. Each party will retain all Tax Returns and related
records and materials of Company for the Tax period first ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent the other party
reasonably requests, any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the
Tax Returns and other records

    

and materials relate, and abide by any applicable record retention
agreements. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or related records
or materials may dispose of them  _provided_ that such party shall give the
other party the notice in accordance with Section 6.10 prior to doing so,
and if the other party so requests allow the other party to take possession
or make copies of such Tax Returns or related records or materials. Each
party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or information
so provided.

 

(g) Purchase Price Allocation. Promptly after Closing, Buyer will engage
Ernst and Young to prepare and deliver to Buyer and Seller within 60 days
after Closing an appraisal of the fair market value of the assets of the
Company as of the Closing. Buyer shall deliver to Seller for review and
approval (which shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) a
completed IRS From 8594 that shows the allocation of the values among the
classes of assets as required by Section 1060 and in accordance with the
appraisal. Except as otherwise required by Law, (A) none of the parties will
take a position on any Tax Return or in any proceeding inconsistent with such
allocations, and (B) the parties shall file all Tax Returns and forms
(including Forms 8883 and comparable forms under other Tax Law) consistently
with such allocations. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers right to approval
does not include a right to contest the allocation prepared by Ernst and Young.

her own behalf and on behalf of its, his or her Affiliates and successors and

respect to the subject matter released herein, but agrees that it has taken
that possibility into account in reaching this Agreement and as to which it
expressly assumes the risk.

(i) solicit or attempt to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any
employee, consultant, supplier, vendor, licensor, licensee, contractor,
agent, strategic partner, distributor, customer or other Person to terminate
or modify any agreement, arrangement or course of dealing with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates engaged in the Business (including, without limitation, by

Buyer, the Business or any of its operations, officers, directors or
investors); or

 

(ii) solicit for employment or employ or retain (or arrange to have any other
Person employ or retain) any individual who has been employed or retained by
the Company or any of its Affiliates within the 12 months preceding the

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
Shareholders, Seller, their Affiliates, or any other Person from making a
general, public solicitation for employment, or using an employee recruiting
or search firm to conduct a search, that does not specifically target
employees or consultants of the Business, provided that this sentence will
not serve to limit in any way the other restrictions contained herein,

Person engaged in a Competing Business in the United States of America or

company, nor shall it prohibit general solicitation that is not directed
specifically to any person so long as such general solicitation is not for
purposes prohibited by this Section 6.18.

 

(d) Seller and each Shareholder acknowledges that the restrictive covenants
set forth in this Section 6.18 are reasonable and necessary to protect
the legitimate interests of Buyer and Buyers Affiliates, that the duration
and scope of such restrictive covenants are reasonable given the geographic
scope of the Business, and that Buyer would not enter into this Agreement but
for Seller and each Shareholders agreement to be bound thereby. Seller and
each Shareholder also

   

acknowledges that any claim that such Seller or Shareholder may have against
Buyer shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Buyer of these
restrictive covenants (e.g., these covenants are independent of any
other provision in this Agreement and of any other promise made to such
Seller or Shareholder). Further, Seller and each Shareholder acknowledges
that upon any breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Section
6.18, Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, will have the right and remedy
to seek such breaching party to account for and pay over to Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,
increments or other benefits derived or received by such breaching party as
the result of such breach. The rights and remedies set forth in this

as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

 

(e) If any Shareholder, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates breaches
the terms of this Section 6.18 in any respect, the restrictions contained

Section 6.19. No Solicitation.

 

(a) Until the earlier of the Closing or the date of termination of this
Agreement, the Company, Seller and each Shareholder shall not (nor shall the
Company, Seller, or any Shareholder permit, as applicable, any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates to), directly or indirectly, take
any of the following actions with any party other than Buyer and its
designees: (i) solicit, encourage, seek, entertain, support, assist, initiate
or participate in any inquiry, negotiations or discussions, or enter into any
agreement, with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any

the LLC Interests (whether or not outstanding), whether by merger, purchase
of assets, tender offer, license or otherwise, or effect any such
transaction, (ii) disclose any information not customarily disclosed to any
person concerning the business or properties of the Company, or afford to any
Person access to its properties, books or records, not customarily afforded

tender offer or otherwise. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to

(b) In the event that the Company, Seller, any Shareholder or any of their
respective Affiliates shall receive or already has received, prior to the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement, any offer, proposal, or
request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in clause (i), (iii),
or (iv) above, or any request for disclosure or access as referenced in
clause (ii) above, the Company, Seller or any Shareholder, as the case may
be, shall immediately (x) suspend any discussions with such offeror or party
with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y) notify Buyer
thereof, including information as to the identity of the offeror or the party
making any such offer or proposal and such other information related thereto
as Buyer may reasonably request.

    

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 6.19 were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed by the parties hereto that Buyer shall be entitled to an immediate
injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.19
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States of America or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in
equity.

 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth above by any officer, manager, agent,

(a) Except in the cases of fraud, if Seller or any Shareholder is the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(i) until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
8.02(a)(i) exceeds $7,000,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in
excess of the Deductible.

 

(b) Except in the cases of fraud, if Buyer is the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 8.03(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under Section 8.03(a) exceeds

   

the Deductible, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall only be required
to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the
aggregate liability of (i) Seller to any Indemnified Party and Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price actually received by Seller or
(ii) any Shareholder to any Indemnified Party and Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement exceed such Shareholders Pro Rata Share of the Purchase Price
actually received by Seller.

 

(d) From and after the Closing for purposes of determining the amount of any
Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder,
each representation and warranty and covenant in this Agreement and each
certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to the term "material" or any similar
qualifier, as if such words and surrounding related words (e.g., "reasonably
be expected to" and similar restrictions and qualifiers) were deleted from
such representation and warranty or covenant. 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to Sections 2.05(f) and 8.07, in no event will Seller or any Shareholder be
liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder and Buyer shall solely look to the
RandW Insurance Policy for coverage of any Losses regardless of whether such
policy provides coverage for such Losses, except in the cases of fraud.

 

(f) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section
8.03 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability
or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds
(other than the RandW Insurance Policy) and any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment received or reasonably expected to be received by the
Indemnified Party (or the Company) in respect of any such claim (net of any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party (or the
Company) in collecting such amounts). The Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies
or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior
to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(g) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section
8.03 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax
benefit realized or reasonably expected to be realized as a result of such
Loss by the Indemnified Party.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification under this Article
VIII with respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses (i) are included
on, or is a liability accrued for on or reserved or reflected in, the Balance
Sheet; (ii) arise out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law;
(iii) are previously reflected in the Purchase Price adjustments under
Article II; or (iv) are duplicative of Losses that have previously been
recovered hereunder.

 

(i) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss, including pursuing recovery under the
RandW Insurance Policy, upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that
would be reasonably expected to, or does,

   

give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyers rights to indemnification hereunder shall not be limited in cases of
fraud in any respect. 

  

Section 8.05. Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification
will be asserted and resolved as follows (with the Shareholder Representative
to procedurally act on behalf of and for the benefit of the Seller and the
Shareholders, with the Seller and the Shareholders remaining liable for all
payments), provided that if the claim is a Tax claim, the procedures set
forth in Section 6.14(f), shall, if inconsistent with this Section 8.05
shall control:

 

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of
the assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Only if the Third-
Party Claim is fully covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, but not assume, the defense of
any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the
Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in good faith in such defense; _provided, however_ , that Seller and
Shareholders agree and consent, as a condition of such entitlement of
participation, that, to the extent the Indemnified Party is Buyer, Buyers
legal counsel in the Third-Party Claim shall not be precluded from
representing Buyer as against Seller or Shareholders in the event that Seller
or Shareholders dispute the fact or amount of Buyers claim of a Loss related
to such matter. Only if the Third-Party Claim is fully covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy, the Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim, and
shall notify the Indemnifying Party that it intends to assume the control of
the defense of such claim; _provided, that_ , the Indemnified Party shall
conduct any such defense reasonably and in good faith and, only if such
Third-Party Claim is fully covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, in the event
that any claim is settled without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
such settlement shall not be dispositive of the amount of Losses. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Party shall have no power or authority to object to the amount
of any Third-Party Claim by the Indemnified Party. Only if the Third-Party
Claim is (A) not fully covered by the RandW Insurance Policy, (B) is not solely
for monetary Losses and (C) the Indemnifying Party confirms in writing that
it is responsible for Losses and has an indemnification obligation pursuant
to Section 8.02 or 8.03, as applicable, then the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the

   

Indemnifying Party\'s expense and by the Indemnifying Party\'s own counsel
(subject to the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent to the counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense. Only if the Third-Party Claim is not fully covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy and in that case where the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to limitations on settlement below,
it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, and/or appeal any such Third-Party Claim in the name of and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party and make counterclaims pertaining to any
such Third-Party Claim in the name of and on behalf of the Company. In such
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party\'s right to control the
defense thereof. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the Indemnifying Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect thereto; provided, however, that it
shall not be unreasonable for the Indemnified Party to withhold, condition,
or delay consent in the event that such settlement, compromise, discharge or
consent to judgment (A) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written
release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (B) contains
any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf
of the Indemnified Party, and (C) contains any equitable order, judgment or
term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with, or disparages,
the business of the Indemnified Party or of any of the Indemnified Party\'s
Affiliates, including the Buyer and the Company in the case of a Buyer
Indemnified Party. Except to the extent it would cause the waiver of a legal
privilege, the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party, Seller,
Shareholders, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
Section 6.08) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow
the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including

   

access to the Companys premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request; _provided that_ such
access will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with normal operations of Buyer and its Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have accepted such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party
shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.06. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.07. Exclusive Remedies.

 

(a) Subject to Sections 2.05(f), 9.02 and 9.03 and only with respect to
a party\'s right to seek specific performance or other injunctive relief
under Section 10.12, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims of any nature whatsoever
(other than claims arising from fraud on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
set forth herein, with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents (other than the Supply Agreements and
New Leases) or the subject matter hereunder or thereunder, or arising in
connection herewith or therewith or otherwise relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII and, solely with respect to a Buyer
Indemnified Party, only by recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy regardless
of whether such policy provides coverage.

 

THE PARTIES HAVE ELECTED TO PURCHASE THE RandW INSURANCE POLICY AT SHARED
EXPENSE TO INSURE AGAINST CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND COVENANTS AND THE RISK THAT
ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE INCORRECT.
BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE REMEDIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 8.07
AND ARTICLE VIII ARE BUYERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, AND SELLERS AND
SHAREHOLDERS ENTIRE OBLIGATION, WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF
SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, OR ANY CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THE SUPPLY
AGREEMENTS AND NEW LEASES) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY, OR UNDER ANY THEORY (INCLUDING STATUTORY, TORT, CONTRACT, AT LAW OR
EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN THE FIRST CLAUSE OF SECTION
8.07(a) ABOVE).

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, or arising in connection herewith or therewith,
whether under any Laws, at common law, in equity or otherwise, whether in
contract, statutory,

   

tort or otherwise, it may have against the Company, Seller, or any
Shareholder and their respective Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this ARTICLE VIII or in the Supply Agreements and New Leases.

 

(c) Nothing in this Section 8.07, including subsection (b) above, shall
limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to Sections 9.03 or 10.12 or to seek any
remedy on account of fraud by any party hereto.

 

ARTICLE IX

prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Shareholder Representative and
Buyer;

 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to the Shareholder Representative if:

 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement

Drop Dead Date; or 

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 shall

to the Closing;

 

(c) by the Shareholder Representative by written notice to Buyer if:

 

(i) none of Seller, Shareholders, or the Company are then in material breach

breach, inaccuracy or failure is not cured within 60 days of notice of the
foregoing effect or is incapable of being cured by Buyer by the Drop Dead
Date; or

 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 shall
not have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date, unless such failure shall be

performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; or

   

(iii) (1) all conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied

Buyer) and (2) Buyer shall have failed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by not later than the Drop Dead Date (other
than as a result of the Sellers refusal to proceed with the Closing), or

and Article X hereof; and 

  

(b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any

(a)

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (A)(1) all
conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing excepting any of such conditions which have become impossible to be
satisfied and other than any condition that was not satisfied as a result of
the breach of, or default under, this Agreement by Buyer) and (2) Buyer shall
have failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
not later than the Drop Dead Date (other than as a result of the Sellers
refusal to proceed with the Closing), or (B) this Agreement is terminated by

either such case, promptly, and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days
of the date of such termination, Buyer shall pay to the Company $50,000,000
(the "Termination Fee", as may be increased and/or credited pursuant
to Section 9.03(c)).

 

 _OR_

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IX, if (1) a request
for additional information or documentary material pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
Sec. 18a(c)(1)(A) is received, i.e. a second request,

    

then Buyer shall pay to the Company $20,000,000 and (2) in addition to the
foregoing, unless the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been
consummated prior to each such subsequent date, then (w) on the date that is
180 days after the day that the initial filings of Buyer and Seller pursuant
to the HSR Act have been made, Buyer shall pay to the Company an additional
$15,000,000, and (x) on the Drop Dead Date, Buyer shall pay to the Company an
additional $15,000,000, and (y) if the Buyer extends the Drop Dead Date for
an initial period of 30 days (the "Drop Dead Date Extension"), then Buyer
shall pay to the Company an additional $10,000,000, and (z) if the Buyer
extends the Drop Dead Date following the expiration of the Drop Dead Date
Extension, then Buyer shall pay to the Company an additional $10,000,000
(such initial $20,000,000 payment and subsequent payments described in
subclauses (w), (x), (y) and (z) above, each, an "Advancement"
and collectively, the "Advancements"), in each case promptly, and in any
event, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of such milestone, if any,
by wire transfer of same day funds as directed in writing by the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by (1) Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) or (2) by either party pursuant to Section
9.01(d)(i), then in each case promptly, and in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of such termination, the Company shall return any
Advancements paid pursuant to this Section 9.03(a)(ii) by wire transfer of
same day funds as directed in writing by the Buyer.

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if a complaint is filed seeking a Governmental
Order to bar the Closing or seek any other remedy pursuant to the HSR Act,
and if Buyer and the Shareholder Representative mutually agree to defend
against such complaint, then no Termination Fee and no Advancement, to the
extent not already paid, shall be payable until and unless such a
Governmental Order is issued or entered in final and non-appealable form, and
no such defense may be undertaken without such agreement to defend between
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative, provided that such agreement shall
not be unreasonably withheld by either party.

  

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 9.03 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee or any
Advancements in accordance with Section 9.03(a), (i) Buyer shall pay to
the Company interest on the unpaid amount from such tenth Business Day after
such termination at a rate equal to the prime rate, as published by the 
_Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern edition, plus two percent (2%), compounding
monthly, until all amounts owing by Buyer under this Section 9.03 have been
paid in full and (ii) if in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit that results in a final judgment against Buyer for the
amount set forth in Section 9.03 or any portion thereof, Buyer shall pay to
the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of
accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing in any of
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable under this
Agreement ( _it being understood_ that, any Advancements paid pursuant to this
Section 9.03 shall be included in the definition of Termination Fee and
credited against the Termination Fee if such Termination Fee is required to be
paid pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i)), (i) the payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 9.03 shall constitute a reasonable

   

estimate of the monetary damages that will be suffered by the Company by
reason of breach or termination of this Agreement in such circumstances, and
(ii) any reimbursement and expense obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section
9.03, shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary
damages of the Company arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including any breach by Buyer),
the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Seller, Shareholders,
and the Company expressly acknowledge and agree that upon termination of this
Agreement under such circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable
under this Agreement, upon payment and receipt of the Termination Fee, none
of Seller, Shareholders, or the Company shall have any other rights and
remedies available to them, in Law or equity, other than pursuant to this
Section 9.03; _provided_ , that the Shareholder Representative, Seller,
Shareholders, and the Company shall have the right to seek injunctive relief
or specific performance to enforce this Article IX.

exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 

Section 10.07. Disclosure Schedules. Certain information set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement is included solely for informational
purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.
The disclosure of any information shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed
in connection with the representations and warranties made by Seller,
Shareholders, or the Company, as applicable, in this Agreement or that such
information is material, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality, nor shall it be deemed an admission of any liability
of, or concession as to any defense available to, Seller, any Shareholder,
the Company or the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Seller or the
Shareholders, as applicable. The Section number headings in the Disclosure
Schedules correspond to the Section numbers in this Agreement and any
information disclosed in any Section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated into any other Section of the
Disclosure Schedules where such disclosure would be reasonably apparent on
its face.

  

Section 10.08. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided, however,_ that Buyer may assign any or all of its
rights, interests or obligations to one or more Affiliates (in any and all
cases, Buyer shall nonetheless remain responsible for the performance of all
obligations hereunder). No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of
any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 10.09. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in
Sections 6.05 and 6.07 and Article VIII, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.10. Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only
be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by
Buyer, the Shareholder Representative, Seller, and such Shareholder or
Shareholders affected by such amendment, modification or supplement. No
waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver
by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any
failure, breach or

   

default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 10.11. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction).

 

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THE SUPPLY AGREEMENTS AND
THE NEW LEASES) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE
INSTITUTED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE CITY OF
PORTLAND, OR, TO THE EXTENT SUCH COURTS DO NOT HAVE SUBJECT MATTER
JURISDICTION, THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF OREGON LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF
MULTNOMAH, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND
AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THE SUPPLY
AGREEMENTS AND THE NEW LEASES) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THE SUPPLY AGREEMENTS AND THE NEW LEASES) OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS

Article VIII, shall be in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 10.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission
shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original
signed copy of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.14. Non-recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against those parties that
are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other
Representative of any party hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto,
or any of their successors or permitted assigns, shall have any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or
for any claim or action based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

Section 10.15. Conflicts and Privilege. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that Tonkon Torp LLP ("Tonkon") has acted as counsel
to the Company, Shareholder Representative, Seller, and each of the
Shareholders in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(a) Buyer hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause, the Company to
consent and agree to, Tonkon representing the Shareholder Representative,
Seller, and/or any of the Shareholders (collectively, the "Seller Parties")
after the Closing, including, without limitation, with respect to disputes in
which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Buyer
and its subsidiaries (including the Company). In connection with the
foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Tonkons prior
representation of the Company and (ii) Tonkons representation of the
Shareholder Representative, Seller and the Shareholders prior to and after
the Closing, including the communication by Tonkon to the Seller Parties in
connection with any such representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
consent and waiver of the right to assert any conflict of interest is solely
limited to matters arising in connection with the negotiation and
documentation of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Nothing in this Section 10.15
shall constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or any privilege
associated with the Company on any matter (other than Tonkons representation
of the Company in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents,
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in a manner that would
not materially prejudice the Companys rights and obligations vis a vis third
parties), and does not waive or excuse Tonkon from complying with applicable
rules of professional conduct regarding

   

the confidentiality of any client information of the Company other than as
it pertains to Tonkons representation of the Company in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

 

(b) In addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences
between the Company, Seller, the Shareholders or the Shareholder
Representative, on the one hand, and Tonkon, on the other hand, in the course
of the negotiation and documentation of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to the Seller, the Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative
(and not the Company) and may be controlled by the Seller, the Shareholders
and the Shareholder Representative. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, the Seller, the Shareholders and the
Shareholder Representative and their Affiliates (and not the Company) shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
negotiation and documentation of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, and the Company shall not be a holder thereof. 

 

ARTICLE XI  
Shareholder Representative

 

Section 11.01. Appointment. Seller and each Shareholder hereby appoints as
of the date hereof, Charles W. Eggert, as the Shareholder Representative and
as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and exclusive agent of Seller and
such Shareholder under this Agreement. The Shareholder Representative shall
have full power and authority to take any and all actions which it believes
are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement, including giving and
receiving any notice or instruction permitted or required under this
Agreement by the Shareholder Representative, interpreting all of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, authorizing payments to be made with
respect hereto or thereto, obtaining reimbursement as provided for herein,
defending all indemnity claims and all disputes pursuant hereunder,

contemplated by this Agreement, and engaging counsel, accountants or other
representatives in connection with the foregoing matters. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder Representative shall have
the full power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof in its
capacity as the Shareholder Representative. The powers, immunities and rights
to indemnification granted to the Shareholder Representative hereunder are
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the Seller or respective
Shareholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto. Buyer may deal
solely with and rely solely on the Shareholder Representative as the
representative of Seller and all the Shareholders. Buyer shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of Seller or any
Shareholder by the Shareholder Representative, and on any other action taken
or purported to be taken on behalf of Seller or any Shareholder by the
Shareholder Representative, as fully binding on Seller or such Shareholder.

  

Section 11.02. Authorization. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Shareholder Representative shall have authority to: 

    

(a) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to Seller or any
Shareholder, or any of them, pursuant to this Agreement and to receive and
accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding
arising under this Agreement; 

 

(b) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with this Agreement as the Shareholder
Representative may in its sole discretion deem appropriate; and

 

(c) Take such action as the Shareholder Representative may in its sole
discretion deem appropriate in respect of: (i) waiving any inaccuracies in
the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto; (ii) taking such other
action as the Shareholder Representative is authorized to take under this
Agreement; (iii) receiving all documents or certificates and making all
determinations, in its capacity as the Shareholder Representative, required
under this Agreement; (iv) all such actions as may be necessary to carry out
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the defense
and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification is sought and any
waiver of any obligation of Buyer in accordance with the terms of Article
VIII; and (v) all such actions expressly authorized in this Agreement to be
conducted or performed by the Shareholder Representative. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Shareholder
Representative shall have no duties or liability to the Seller or any
Shareholder with respect to any action taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Shareholder Representative in connection with this Agreement.
Seller and each Shareholder (i) agrees that all actions taken by the
Shareholder Representative under this Agreement shall be binding upon Seller,
such Shareholder and such Sellers or Shareholders successors as
if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by Seller or such Shareholder,
and (ii) waives any and all defenses which may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholder Representative taken in
good faith under this Agreement.

 

Section 11.03. Agency. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
the Shareholder Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of
the Seller or any Shareholder, except as expressly provided herein, and the
Shareholder Representative shall have no liability to Seller or any
Shareholder with respect to any action taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Shareholder Representative in connection with this
Agreement. 

 

Section 11.04. Indemnification of Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable to Seller or any Shareholder for any
action or failure to act in connection with the acceptance or administration
of the Shareholder Representatives duties hereunder or under any Shareholder
Representative engagement agreement, unless and only to the extent such
action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Seller and each Shareholder shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Shareholder Representative from and against any loss, liability claim,
damage, cost, fee, judgment, amount paid in settlement, fine or expense
(including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers) (collectively, the "Shareholder Representative
Expenses") incurred by the Shareholder Representative or any of its Related
Persons and any of their respective consultants, attorneys, accountants,
advisors,

   

brokers, or representatives, in each case relating to the Shareholder
Representatives conduct as the Shareholder Representative, other than
losses, liabilities or expenses resulting from the Shareholder
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its performance under this Agreement. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Shareholder
Representative and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement. The
Shareholder Representative Expenses shall be paid directly by Seller or the
Shareholders accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. The Shareholder
Representative may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on
the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Shareholder Representative in accordance with such advice, the
Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to Seller, any Shareholder, or
any other Person. In no event shall the Shareholder Representative be liable
hereunder or in connection herewith for any indirect, punitive, special or
consequential damages.

 

Section 11.05. Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its duties
hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any
document or instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to
content and signed by Seller, any Shareholder, or any other party and
to assume that any Person purporting to give any notice in accordance with
the provisions hereof or sign any document or instrument on behalf of the
applicable Seller, Shareholder or other party has been duly authorized to
do so. 

  

 **Section 11.06. Resignation and Removal of Shareholder Representative.**
The Shareholder Representative may resign at any time by written notice to
the other Shareholders and Buyer, and a majority in interest of the
Shareholders shall have the right at any time to remove the then-acting
Shareholder Representative and to appoint a successor upon the resignation,
removal or death of the Shareholder Representative. For all purposes
hereunder, a majority in interest of the Shareholders shall be determined on
the basis of each Shareholders Pro Rata Share as of Closing. Any successor
to the Shareholder Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Shareholder Representative, and the term "Shareholder
Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any interim or
successor Shareholder Representative. Except as provided in this Section
11.06, the appointment of the Shareholder Representative hereunder is
irrevocable and any action taken by the Shareholder Representative pursuant
to the authority granted in this Article XI shall be effective and absolutely
binding as the action of the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement.

 

Section 11.07. Expenses of Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder
Representatives reasonable out of pocket costs and any of the Shareholder
Representative Expenses will be paid by Seller or Shareholders accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Share.
