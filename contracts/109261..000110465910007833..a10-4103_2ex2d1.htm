the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

  



  

### **(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and

$38.00 per share of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable, without interest, to the holder of such share of Company Common
Stock, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09, of the
certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock or

or indirect wholly owned Company Subsidiary shall be canceled without
any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with

or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding; and**

  

### ** **

### 

  

### (e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding Company Common Stock is changed into a different number
of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
or any similar event, the Merger Consideration will be
appropriately adjusted.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.07 _Restricted Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each restricted
share of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding and subject to forfeiture immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") will become fully vested without
restrictions and will be treated as a share of Company Common Stock as set
forth in Section 2.06.

  



  

SECTION 2.08 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger
nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in
writing appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration. Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment
of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock under such Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.09,
of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of
Company Common Stock.

  



  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.09 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. (a)  Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall designate a bank or trust company
(reasonably acceptable to Parent) to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_
") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.06(a). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid in accordance with
this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund may not be used for any other purpose. The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation
in one or more of the following: (i) direct obligations of the United States
of America; (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all

  



        
   

  



  

principal and interest; and (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no gain or loss on the Exchange Fund will affect the amounts payable to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock following completion of the
Merger, and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Exchange Fund at all times includes cash sufficient to satisfy Parents
obligations under this Article II.

  



  

### (b) Promptly, but in any event within three business days, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then
be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder
of such Certificate.  If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock is registered
on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Merger Sub that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of shares of Company Common Stock such
amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and are paid or will be paid in accordance with applicable Law to
the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

### 

  

### (d) At any time following the six month anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable

  



        
   

  



  

### upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law.

  

### 

  

### (e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.06(a).

any matter set forth in any section or subsection of the Disclosure Letter
will be deemed to be disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement and all
other sections and subsections of the Disclosure Letter to which it is

necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger have been duly and validly

enforceability may be limited by applicable Law affecting creditors rights
generally, by general equitable principles and by the discretion of any
Governmental Authority before which any proceeding seeking enforcement may be
brought (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). The Company Board has approved
this Agreement and the Merger and such approvals are sufficient so that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL

to the Merger.

will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated By-laws of the
Company or any equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary,
(ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and other authorizations described
in Section 3.05(b) have been obtained and that all filings and other actions
described in Section 3.05(b) have been made or taken, conflict with or
violate any United States or non-United States national, state, provincial,
municipal or local statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive
order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order (" _Law_ ") applicable to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or subject, or (iii) result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or a Company Subsidiary or any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except,
with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any United States or non-United States national, state, provincial,
municipal or local government, governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal or
judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except for (i)
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) the pre-merger notification
requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL, (iv) any consent, approval,
authorization, permit, filing or notification listed in Section 3.05(b)
of the Disclosure Letter, and (v) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.06 _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is in possession of all material franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for it to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the " _Permits_ ").  No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened.  Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, Permit or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except, in either
case, for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not
constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC

respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
(ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is required to
file any form, report or other document with the SEC.  The Company has not
received any non-routine inquiries or interrogatories, whether in writing or
otherwise, from the SEC, the NYSE or any other Governmental Authority, or, to
the knowledge of the Company, been the subject of any investigation, audit,
review or hearing by or in front of such persons, in each case with respect
to any of the Company SEC Reports or any of the information contained therein
that have not been fully resolved.

  



  

### (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance in all material respects with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments which are not, in the aggregate, material to the Company and

nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for
liabilities and obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2009, (ii) permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) that would not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) The Company has resolved all comments contained in comment letters
received by the Company from the SEC or the staff thereof prior to the date
of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act designed to ensure that all
material information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Companys SEC filings and such controls are effective.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Company maintains a standard system of accounting established and
administered in accordance with GAAP. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance

  



        
   

  



  

### that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. Management of the Company has
disclosed to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting, in each case that are within the knowledge of the Company.

  

###

Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice and (b) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect. Since
December 31, 2009 through the date hereof, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has taken any action that would have constituted a breach of

circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liabilities under (A) Title IV of ERISA, (B) Section 302 of ERISA or

expected to be a material liability of the Surviving Corporation following

subject to Section 409A of the Code that provide for contributions, accruals
or vesting of accruals after December 31, 2004 have been timely amended to
comply with the requirements of the final regulations under Section 409A, and

being accounted for under the installment method of Section 453 of the Code.

Law) or material deferred intercompany gain or loss arising under the
provisions of the applicable consolidated

  



        
   

  



  

return regulations (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or non-United States Tax Law) in effect for transactions occurring in taxable
years beginning before July 12, 1995 that are attributable to a transfer or
other disposition of stock of a Company Subsidiary, and none of the shares of

geographic area or during any period of time; and (vii) all other contracts
and agreements (other than (A) insurance policies issued by any Company
Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, (B) reinsurance contracts
(whether assumed or ceded) entered into by a Company Subsidiary in the
ordinary course of business and (C) contracts between the Company or any

has previously expired in accordance with its terms, (ii) none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary has received any claim of default under or

SECTION 4.01 _Corporate Organization_. Parent is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Canada and
Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or
to have such power or authority would

  



        
   

  



  

not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
performing its obligations under this Agreement. Merger Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of

Merger have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of

Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

SECTION 4.03 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.  (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not, and the
consummation of the Merger by Parent and Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or
other organizational documents of either Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming
that all consents, approvals and other authorizations described in Section
4.03(b) have been obtained and that all filings and other actions described
in Section 4.03(b) have been made or taken, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of
either of them is bound or subject, or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such

consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
performing its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except for (i)
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) the pre-merger notification
requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL, (iv) the insurance regulatory
filings and approvals listed in

  



        
   

  



  

### Section 3.05(b) of the Disclosure Letter and (v) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, or otherwise prevent
Parent or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent has no reason to believe that any facts or conditions related
to it, Merger Sub or any of its other affiliates, including its identity,
business, investments, investors, regulatory status or planned approach to
financing the transactions contemplated hereby or operating the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, are
reasonably likely to impede its ability promptly to obtain any governmental
approvals required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### 

  

SECTION 4.04 _Financing_. Parent has and, at the Effective Time, will have
sufficient funds to permit Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other amounts required to be paid
by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and to perform the
other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder.

Parent or Merger Sub.

behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will not, at the date
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

### following the receipt of a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or
a proposal that is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal that in
either case was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in circumstances
not otherwise involving a breach of this Section 6.04, the Company Board

acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ ") related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a customary

Stockholder Approval, in response to a proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was

a whole, or 10% or more of any class of voting equity securities of the

which, considering all relevant factors (including whether financing for such
offer is fully committed or is reasonably likely to be obtained), the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of

the Company and its stockholders than the Merger.

and for so long as Stanley Zax serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the
Surviving Corporation, Stanley Zax shall have sole discretion to determine

_Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or judgments, including any amounts that
are paid in settlement with the approval of the Surviving Corporation (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection
with any Action based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or
omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving
Corporation will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by Law
to advance such expenses upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined in accordance with applicable Law
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.  Without

under this Section 6.06, upon learning of any such Action shall

  



        
   

  



  

### notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify the
Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any
liability which it may have under this Section 6.06 except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation), and shall deliver
to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking of the kind described above.
The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition
to local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction if reasonably required)
to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties.

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are
set forth in Articles EIGHTH and NINTH of the Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, which provisions may not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years from and after the Effective
Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by applicable Law,
and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

  

###

from an insurer chosen by the Company, a single payment, run-off policy of
directors and officers liability insurance covering the Indemnified
Parties, such policy to become effective at the Closing and remain in effect
for a period of six years after the Closing ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if the Company does not purchase such policy, for six years from and after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
with respect to those persons who are currently covered by such policy on
terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Companys directors and officers, as the case may be,
currently covered by such policy than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company pay more than 300% of the current annual
premium of $862,028.00 payable by the Company for such insurance ( such
amount of $2,586,084.00, the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_
, that if the Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 6.06(c) for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Amount, it
shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the Maximum Amount;
and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall provide for the current officers and
directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who become directors or
officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Closing to be covered under
the Surviving Corporations directors and officers liability program with
the same terms as those applicable to the other officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries.

  

###

person then, and in each such case, as a condition to any such merger,
consolidation, transfer or

  



        
   

  



  

### conveyance, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.06.

Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.06.

notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)

Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto

### (a) The Company agrees that:

  

### 

  

##### (i) if Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(ii);

  

##### 

  

##### (ii) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

##### 

  

##### (iii) if (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal; and (B) thereafter Parent or the
Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(b)(i),
(y) Section 8.01(b)(ii) (but only in the case of this clause (y) if the
order, decree or ruling is based on the existence of such Takeover Proposal
(whether or not modified after it was first made)) or (z) Section
8.01(b)(iii); and (C) such Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified after
it was first made) is consummated within one (1) year of such termination (
_provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.03(b)(iii), all references
to 10% in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be replaced with
references to 50%);

  

##### 

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent (1) prior to or simultaneously with such

### representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement) then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all of its Expenses,
up to a maximum of $1,500,000.00 (not later than two business days after
submission of statements therefor); _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(a), then
the Company may reduce any such Termination Fee by the full amount of any
expense reimbursement paid to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.03(b). Parent
agrees that if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i) (provided that the Company is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement) then Parent shall reimburse the Company for all of its Expenses,

submission of statements therefor).

  

### 

  

### (c) If Parent is entitled to terminate this Agreement and receive a

constitute liquidated damages and be the sole and exclusive remedy regardless
of the circumstances of such termination.

this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

###

SECTION 9.02 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination will have
the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and

  



        
   

  



  

this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.  In the event such court does not exercise the power
granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  



  

SECTION 9.03 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes, except as
set forth in Sections 6.03(b), all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether
pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise), except that either
of Parent and Merger Sub may (in its sole discretion) assign all or any of
its rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party
of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

SECTION 9.04 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto (and their successors and
permitted assigns), and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person (including any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 6.06 (which are
intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or the persons
entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such persons).

  



  

SECTION 9.05 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on
a timely basis or were otherwise breached, and that the parties, without the
necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Agreement and to
specific performance of the terms hereof to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the other parties hereto agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that there is an adequate
remedy available at law. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights,
obligations and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and in
addition to any other rights, obligations and remedies otherwise available at
law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein will be
considered an election of remedies.

  



  

SECTION 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating

  



        
   

  



  

thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action except in such court, (ii) agrees that
any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
venue of any such action or proceeding in such court, and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of any inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in any such action or proceeding
in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01 of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the
right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

  



  

SECTION 9.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.07.

  



  

SECTION 9.08 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. In this Agreement,
except to the extent otherwise provided or that the context otherwise

Section, sub-Section or Schedule, such reference is to the corresponding

SECTION 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile and other means of electronic transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.
