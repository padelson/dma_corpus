Article II 
  
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. The Company shall be
the surviving entity in the Merger and shall continue to exist as a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (the " _Surviving Entity_ "). The Merger shall
have the effects specified in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise
agreed to pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest and continue in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Certificate of Merger_ _; Closing_.

  



  

(a) _Closing_. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held
remotely by electronic exchange of deliverables and release of signatures on
the date which is two (2) Business Days after the first date on which all
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ shall have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof) or such
other time and place as Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

(b) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ of this Agreement, and provided this Agreement has not
theretofore been terminated pursuant to its terms, the parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, and shall make or cause to be made all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Certificate of Merger has been accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as may be
agreed by Parent and the Company in writing and specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 2.3 _Organizational Documents; Name of Surviving Entity_. The
corporate bylaws and certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in the forms
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , as amended pursuant to the Certificate of
Merger, shall be the corporate bylaws and certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Entity and shall continue in full force and effect until further
amended in the manner prescribed therein or by the provisions of the DGCL,
except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to
"Metromile Operating Company."

  



  

Section 2.4 _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) The parties shall take all actions necessary such that the board of
directors of the Surviving Entity and the officers of the Surviving Entity as
of immediately following the Effective Time shall be comprised of the
individuals set forth on _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules, each
to hold office in accordance with the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of
the Surviving Entity until their respective successors are, in the case of
the directors, duly elected or appointed and qualified and, in the case
of the officers, duly appointed.

  



    

18

 



    



  

(b) The parties shall cause the Parent Board and the officers of Parent as of
immediately following the Effective Time to be comprised of the individuals
set forth on Section 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, each to hold office
in accordance with the DGCL and the Organizational Documents of Parent until
their respective successors are, in the case of the directors, duly elected or
appointed and qualified and, in the case of the officers, duly appointed.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Effect of Merger_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause each Company
Preferred Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be automatically converted immediately prior to the
Effective Time into a number of Company Common Shares at the then-effective
conversion rate as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Organizational
Documents of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock Conversion_ "). All
of the Company Preferred Shares converted into Company Common Shares shall be
canceled, shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto, and each holder
of Company Preferred Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such securities.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, following the
Company Preferred Stock Conversion), by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders,
each Company Common Share (including Company Common Shares resulting from the
Company Preferred Stock Conversion) that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, Treasury Shares
and other shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ ) shall be
converted into the right to receive the following:

  



  

(i) if the calculation of the Cash Consideration results in a positive number
(the " _Minimum Cash Election Condition_ ") and the holder of such Company
Common Share makes a proper and timely election in accordance with _Section
2.6_ to receive cash with respect to such Company Common Share (a " _Cash
Election_ "), which election has not been revoked pursuant to _Section 2.6_
(each such share, a " _Cash Electing Share_ "), in an amount in cash for such
Cash Electing Share, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration Value (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "), except that if
(x) the sum of the aggregate number of Dissenting Shares and the aggregate
number of Cash Electing Shares, multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration Value (such product, the " _Aggregate Cash Election Amount_ ")
exceeds the available Cash Consideration, then each Cash Electing Share shall
be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value
and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Cash Consideration
and the denominator of which shall be the Aggregate Cash Election Amount (such
fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (B) a number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(1) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (2) one minus the Cash Fraction; and

  



    

19

 



    



  

(ii) if the holder of such share makes a proper election to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") with respect to such Company
Common Share, which election has not been revoked pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ,
the holder of such share fails to make a Cash Election or Stock Election with
respect to such share in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
_Section 2.6_ , or if the Minimum Cash Election Condition is not satisfied,
the applicable Per Share Stock Consideration.

  



  

(c) Each of the Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except for Dissenting Shares, Treasury Shares
and other shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ , but, for the
avoidance of doubt, including the Company Common Shares resulting from the
Company Preferred Stock Conversion), shall, by virtue of the Merger and upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 2.5_ and
throughout this Agreement, be canceled and automatically deemed for all
purposes to represent the right to receive its allocable portion of the
Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration as provided for in _Section 2.5(b)_
and in the Merger Payment Schedule, and each of the Stockholders shall cease
to have any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no certificates or
scrip representing a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be issued
to any of the Stockholders in connection with payment of the Aggregate
Closing Merger Consideration, and to the extent a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock is issuable as part of the Aggregate Closing Merger
Consideration after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such Stockholder, such fraction shall be
rounded up to one whole share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

(e) Each Company Share owned by any Subsidiary of the Company and each
Treasury Share shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Consideration Election Procedure_.

  



  

(a) On or prior to the Election Date, each Stockholder (i) entitled to
receive consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ and (ii) who was a
Stockholder on the date of the delivery of the Company's Written
Consent solicitation, shall be entitled to specify the number of such
holder's Company Shares with respect to which such holder makes a Cash
Election or a Stock Election by complying with the procedures set forth in
this _Section 2.6_. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary set forth herein, each Cash Election or Stock Election
made pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed to be made with respect
to each applicable Stockholder on an "as-converted" to Company Common Shares
basis.

  



    

20

 



    



  

(b) Not less than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Date, the Company
shall mail or otherwise deliver a form of election (the " _Form of Election_
") to each holder of record (as of such mailing) of Company Shares. Each
Stockholder entitled to receive consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_
shall use the Form of Election to make a Cash Election or a Stock Election. In
the event that any such Stockholder fails to make a Cash Election or a Stock
Election with respect to any or all Company Shares held or beneficially owned
by such holder, then such holder shall be automatically deemed to have made a
Stock Election with respect to those shares.

  



  

(c) Any applicable Stockholder's election pursuant to the Form of Election
will be deemed properly made only if the Company or its designated agent has
received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on the business
day that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Closing Date or
such other date as Parent and the Company will, prior to the Closing, mutually
agree (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of Election duly, completely and
validly executed and accompanied by (i) Certificates to which such Form of
Election relates or (ii) in the case such shares are uncertificated, any
additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election, and in each case, together with any additional documents required by
the procedures set forth in the Form of Election.

  



  

(d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ will have been properly
made only if the Company will have actually received a properly completed
Form of Election prior to the Election Date. Any Form of Election may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by
the Company prior to the Election Date. In the event a Form of Election is
validly revoked prior to the Election Date, the holder of the Company Shares
represented by such Form of Election shall be deemed to have made a Stock
Election with respect to those shares, except to the extent a subsequent
election is properly made prior to the Election Date. Any Cash Election or
Stock Election as of the Election Date is final and irrevocable, unless (i)
otherwise consented to in writing by the Company (which such consent may, in
the Company's sole discretion, be provided or denied), or (ii) this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , in which
case all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement. Without limiting the
application of any other transfer restrictions that may otherwise exist,
after a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made or deemed to be made
with respect to any Company Common Shares (or Company Preferred Shares on an
"as-converted" to Company Common Share basis), no further registration of
transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the
Company until the Closing, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock
Election is validly revoked in accordance with this _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(e) The determination of the Company shall be final, conclusive and binding
in the event of ambiguity or uncertainty as to whether or not a Cash Election
or a Stock Election has been properly made or revoked pursuant to this
_Section 2.6_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of
Election.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 2.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including  _Section 2.6_ , Company Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Company
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares being
referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such Company Shares) shall not be converted
into a right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, but
instead shall be entitled to only receive payment of the appraised value of
such Company Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Company Shares shall be treated as
if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, if any, to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , without interest thereon. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Company Shares, any written withdrawal of any
such demand and any other written demand, notice or instrument delivered to
the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to
such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub or anyone acting on their behalf shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the payment of any Aggregate Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of any such payment
under any applicable tax Law. Any sum which is withheld as permitted by this
_Section 2.8_ shall be timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the proper
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable tax Law, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Treatment of Options_.

  



  

(a) _Vested Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, all Vested Company
Options shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
any Company Optionholder or beneficiary thereof, be converted into a number of
vested restricted stock units denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock ("
_Parent Vested RSUs_ "). The number of Parent Vested RSUs received by a
holder of Vested Company Options shall equal such holder's Aggregate Option
Spread divided by the Reference Price, rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The " _Aggregate Option Spread_ " shall equal the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value over (ii) the
exercise price per Company Common Share subject to such Vested Company
Option, multiplied by (B) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Vested Company Option. The Parent Vested RSUs shall be granted as soon as
practicable following effective registration of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan on a Form S-8 registration
statement (or other appropriate form). Each Parent Vested RSU shall
entitle the holder thereof to receive one share of Parent Common Stock that
shall be delivered, subject to any applicable tax or withholding obligations,
as soon as practicable following the expiration of any applicable Lock-Up
Agreement(s), but in no event later than December 31, 2021.

  



    

22

 



    



  

(b) _Unvested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, all Unvested Company
Options shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of
any Company Optionholder or beneficiary thereof, be converted into an option
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Converted Option_ ").
For each Converted Option, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Converted Option shall equal the product of (A) the
total number of Company Common Shares subject to such Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Stock
Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (ii) the
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock shall equal the quotient (with
the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the exercise price
per Company Common Share of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (B) the Per Share Stock Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ that the exercise price and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Converted Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A;
_provided further_ that in the case of any Unvested Company Option to which
Code Section 422 applies, the exercise price and the number of shares Parent
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in
accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in
order to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 424(a). Except as expressly
provided in the foregoing sentence, each such Converted Option shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions, including the applicable vesting
schedule, as applied to the corresponding Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The Converted Options shall be granted as soon as
practicable following effective registration of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan on a Form S-8 registration
statement (or other appropriate form).

  



  

Section 2.10 _Company Warrants_. Immediately prior to and conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger, each Company Warrant shall either (a)
automatically, and without any required action on the part of the holder of
the Company Warrant or beneficiary thereof or (b) at the election of the
holder of such Company Warrant, be exercised into a number of Company Shares
in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement amendment applicable to
such Company Warrant (each, a " _Warrant Agreement Amendment_ ") and the
information set forth in the Merger Payment Schedule. The Company Warrants
converted into Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease
to exist, and the holder of each Company Warrant shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such securities and become a Stockholder for
all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

Section 2.11 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall,
appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the exchange agent in the Merger. At or before
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to the Cash Consideration and (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Stock Consideration.
Promptly after the appointment of the Exchange Agent, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Shares as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time entitled to receive Aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_ , a letter of transmittal (which shall
be in the form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company)
(a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and which shall (i) have customary
representations and warranties as to title, authorization, execution and
delivery, (ii) have a customary release of all claims against Parent and the
Company arising out of or related to such holder's ownership of Company
Shares, (iii) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "), to the extent such Company Shares are certificated, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
(iv) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal and (v) permit each
Stockholder to allocate, on a share-by-share or "block" basis, those Company
Shares exchanged for such holder's share of the Cash Consideration.

  



  

(b) Within two (2) Business Days (but in no event prior to the Effective
Time) after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by
such holder for cancellation (to the extent such Company Shares are or were
certificated), together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and
Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to deliver the Per Share Stock
Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_ , and the
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.11_ , each Certificate entitled to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed at all times
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share
Cash Consideration, as applicable, that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.5_.

  



  

(c) _Adjustments_. The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to Stockholders for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.11_
 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Per Share Stock Consideration
and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Stockholders as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



    

24

 



    



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Entity shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares (including Company
Common Shares resulting from the conversion of Company Preferred Shares and
the Company Warrants) for any such Company Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with
this _Section 2.11_.

  



  

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed acceptable to the
Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Stock Consideration or Per
Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, that such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of
_Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6(b)_.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Entity with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company or Merger Sub,
the officers and board of directors of the Surviving Entity will be fully
authorized in the name of the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to
take and shall take any and all such lawful and necessary action.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Closing Statement; Merger Payment Schedule_.

  

     



  

(a) At least five (5) Business Days preceding the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide to Parent a written statement, signed by a financial officer of
the Company (the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting forth (a) the Company's
good faith estimate, together with related supporting calculations and work
papers and back-up materials relating thereto, of the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company Entities as of 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date and the amount of Company
Transaction Expenses, including by category those that have been paid or are
to be paid prior to the Closing, those that are to be paid as part of the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.15_ and those that are expected to otherwise
remain unpaid as of the close of business on the Closing Date and satisfied
thereafter in accordance with their terms and (b) calculations of
Repaid Indebtedness, Merger Consideration Value, Cash Consideration and the
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount based on such estimates. The
Closing Statement and all components thereof shall be prepared in accordance
with this Agreement (including the mathematical principles, policies and
methodologies used in, the calculation of the sample Working Capital Amount as
set forth on _Annex A_  hereto). The Company shall provide Parent and its
representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
relevant books, records and finance personnel of the Company to enable Parent
and its representatives to review and analyze the Closing Statement and the
components thereof. The Parties shall meet and confer regarding the Closing
Statement and the components thereof no later than the third (3rd) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, and shall make such changes thereto as the
Parties may mutually and in good faith agree, and the Closing Statement as so
mutually agreed shall be the "Closing Statement" hereunder. If (i) there is a
dispute between the parties regarding the Closing Statement that is not
resolved prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount set forth in the Closing Statement as delivered by the Company is
within $1,000,000 of the Target Net Working Capital Ceiling or Target Net
Working Capital Floor, and (iii) the net amount in dispute exceeds
$1,000,000, then Parent shall have the unilateral option to delay the Closing
for up to a ten (10)-day period (including for such purposes past the Outside
Date, and any such delay period shall suspend the application of the Outside
Date until the expiration of such delay period) for Parent and the Company to
have an opportunity to resolve and settle all then remaining disputes, and the

warranties are made with respect to a certain date, as of such date) as
follows:

Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has full corporate or limited
liability company, as applicable, power and authority to own, operate or
lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to
carry on the Business. _Section 3.1_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth
each Company Entity, its jurisdiction of organization, its directors and
officers, and each jurisdiction in which such Company Entity has a Permit and
is qualified to do business. Each Company Entity is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the properties owned or leased by it or the operation of the Business
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except such licenses or
qualifications the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Section 3.1_ of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Company owns all of the outstanding equity
interests of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and there
are no derivative securities or commitments to issue derivative securities in
respect of such Subsidiaries. The Company does not own or have any ownership
interest in any other Person other than such Subsidiaries. True and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws,

vote or consent of (i) the majority of the holders of the Company Common
Shares and Company Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, and
(ii) at least sixty percent (60%) of the holders of the Company Voting
Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Company (collectively, the " _Company
Stockholder Vote_ "), to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement
to which it is a party and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on
the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or to

Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by (i) any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditor's rights generally, and (ii) as limited by the

case, required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC

incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Parent SEC Documents that
are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of
the Securities Act) and as of the respective dates of the last amendment
filed with the SEC (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents), the

stockholders' equity and cash flows of Parent as at the respective dates of,
and for the periods referred to in, such financial statements, all in
accordance with: (i) GAAP; and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as

Act are being prepared. To Parent's Knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in Parent's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Parent
has established and maintained a system of internal controls and, to Parent's
Knowledge, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's financial reporting and the
preparation of Parent's financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents (including the exhibits

authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. Merger Sub
has no outstanding options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights,

that would require such Subsidiary of Parent to issue, sell or otherwise
cause to become outstanding any of its equity interests (including any equity
interests convertible or exchangeable into equity interests).

Board have taken all necessary action to render inapplicable any control
share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any
distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover

of Delaware that are or could become applicable to the Company as a result of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub fulfilling their respective obligations or
exercising their respective rights under this Agreement, including as a result
of Parent's issuance of the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing herein shall require the Company to use efforts to cause,
or attempt to cause, any purchase of any Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of any Subscription Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_) unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or the requirements of NASDAQ, each of Parent and the Company
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior written consent of the other party. Furthermore, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prevent Parent, the Company or their
respective Affiliates from furnishing customary or other reasonable
information concerning the Transactions to their investors that is
substantively consistent with public statements previously consented to by the
other party in accordance with this _Section 5.5_.

Section 5.6 _Requisite Approval_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Vote pursuant to written consents of the Stockholders in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the " _Written Consent_ ") as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within five (5) Business Days, following the date that
Parent receives, and notifies the Company of Parent's receipt of, SEC
approval and effectiveness of Parent's Proxy Statement as described in
_Section 5.8_. The materials submitted to the Stockholders in connection with
the Written Consent shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Reasonably
promptly following receipt of the Written Consent, the Company shall deliver
a copy of such Written Consent to Parent.

  



  

(b) Reasonably promptly following receipt of the Written Consent, the Company
shall prepare and mail a notice (the " _Stockholder Notice_ ") to every
Stockholder that did not execute the Written Consent. The Stockholder Notice
shall (i) be a statement to the effect that the Company Board unanimously

the DGCL and in the best interests of the Stockholders and unanimously
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (ii) provide the Stockholders to whom it is sent with notice of

of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions in accordance with
Section 228(e) of the DGCL and the bylaws of the Company and (iii) notify
such Stockholders of their dissent and appraisal rights pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL. The Stockholder Notice shall be accompanied by a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL and all such other information as Parent shall

the twenty (20) day period during which a Stockholder must demand appraisal

the DGCL. All materials submitted to the Stockholders in accordance with this
_Section 5.6(b)_ shall be subject to Parent's advance review and

Section 5.7 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall not take any action to waive, eliminate or amend in an adverse
manner to Company Indemnified Persons any rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, and limitation of liability now existing in favor of
any individual who, at or prior to the Effective Time, was a director,
officer, employee or agent of a Company Entity or who, at the request of a
Company Entity, served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such
individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Company Indemnified
Persons_ ").

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, in consultation with
Parent, a post-merger officers' and directors' liability insurance policy
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time which shall
include coverage for claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
Transactions) (the " _Company Post-Merger D andO Policy_"). The costs and
expenses associated with obtaining the Company Post-Merger DandO Policy shall
be deemed a Company Transaction Expense.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
not take any action to waive, eliminate or amend in an adverse manner to
Parent Indemnified Persons any rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, and limitation of liability now existing in favor of any individual
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee or
agent of Parent (collectively, with such individual's heirs, executors or
administrators, the " _Parent Indemnified Persons_ "). Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall obtain a "tail" officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at
least the same coverage and amount and containing terms and conditions that
are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the directors and officers of
Parent as Parent's existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including
in connection with the Transactions).

  



  

(d) This  _Section 5.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Person and each Parent Indemnified Person, and their respective successors,
heirs and representatives.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Proxy Statement; Parent Stockholders ' Meeting_.

     



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall
prepare and file (i) a registration statement (as such filing is amended or
supplemented, the " _Registration Statement_ "), including a proxy statement
of Parent, on Form S-4 with the SEC (as such filing is amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), for the purposes of (A)
registering under the Securities Act the Stock Consideration and the
Additional Shares (together, the " _Registration Shares_ "), (B) providing
Parent's stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and (C) soliciting proxies from
Parent's stockholders to obtain the requisite approval of the Transactions
and the other matters to be voted on at a meeting of the holders of Parent
Common Stock to be called and held for such purpose (the " _Parent
Stockholders ' Meeting_"). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file any other filings
required under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other Laws
relating to the Transactions (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Parent
shall notify the Company promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other
Governmental Authority for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement,
or any Other Filing or for additional information. As promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, Parent shall provide the Company and its counsel with
copies of all written correspondence between Parent or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement,
or any Other Filing. Parent shall permit the Company and its counsel to review
the Proxy Statement, and any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, as
well as any Other Filings, and shall consult with the Company and its advisors
concerning any comments from the SEC with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_further_ that Parent shall reasonably consider and take into account the
reasonable suggestions, comments or opinions of the Company and its advisors,
and shall not file the Proxy Statement, or any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto or any response letters to any comments from the SEC
without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall be permitted to make such filing or response in the absence of
such consent if the basis of the Company's failure to consent is the
Company's unwillingness to permit the inclusion in such filing or response of
information that, based on the advice of outside counsel to Parent, is
required by the SEC and United States securities Laws to be included
therein. Whenever any event occurs which would reasonably be expected to
result in the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party hereto of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of Parent, an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.

  



    

69

 



    



  

(b) The Proxy Statement will be sent to the stockholders of Parent as soon as
practicable following its approval by the SEC (but in any event, within five
(5) Business Days following such approval) for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock to vote at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting in favor of: (i) the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger and other Transactions; (ii) an amendment and
restatement of Parent's certificate of incorporation, in substantially the
form of _Exhibit F_ attached hereto, to increase the authorized number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, change the name of Parent, declassify the

approval as required by the applicable NASDAQ listing rules of the issuance
and sale of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration;
(iv) approval of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan that shall provide for grant
of awards to employees and other service providers of the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries in the form of options, restricted shares, restricted share
units or other equity-based awards based on Parent Common Stock with a total
pool of awards of Parent Common Stock not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the
total number of shares of Parent Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of
the Closing Date using the treasury method of accounting with an annual
"evergreen" increase of five percent (5%) of the shares of Parent Common
Stock outstanding as of the day prior to such increase, (v) the approval and
adoption of the ESPP, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Company, that provides for the grant of purchase rights with respect
to Parent Common Stock to employees of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries with a total pool of shares of Parent Common Stock not exceeding
one and one half percent (1.5%) of the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the Closing Date using the
treasury method of accounting, with an annual "evergreen" increase of one
percent (1%) of the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding as of the day
prior to such increase; (vi) the election of the individuals listed on 
_Section 5.8(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules as directors of Parent, (vii) the

other Transactions (the matters described in clauses (i) through (viii),

Matters by the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting or
any postponement or adjournment thereof shall be referred to as the " _Parent
Stockholder Approval_ ").

with such information concerning the Company Entities as may be necessary for
the information concerning the Company Entities in the Proxy Statement, and
the Other Filings to comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the DGCL in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation
of proxies thereunder, and the calling and holding of the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting, and the preparation and filing of the Other
Filings. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Proxy
Statement does not, as of the date on which it is distributed to the holders
of Parent Common Stock, and as of the date of the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ( _provided_  that
Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any
information relating to the Company or any other information furnished in
writing by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement).

  



  

(i) Parent may only adjourn the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (i) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval, for the absence of a quorum and (ii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that
Parent has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is
required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by Parent's stockholders prior to the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting.

Section 5.10 _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Company acknowledges
that it has received a copy of Parent's final prospectus dated September 2,
2020 (the " _Prospectus_ ") and understands that Parent has established the
Trust Account and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the
amounts held in the Trust Account, Parent may disburse monies from the
Trust Account only: (i) to the "public stockholders" (as defined in the
Prospectus) in the event they elect to redeem their public shares in
connection with the consummation of a "business combination" (as defined in
the Prospectus), (ii) to such public stockholders if Parent liquidates or
fails to consummate such a business combination within eighteen (18)
months from the closing date of Parent's initial public offering (unless such
date is extended with the requisite approval of such public stockholders) or
(iii) to Parent after or concurrently with the consummation of such a business
combination. The Company hereby agrees, on behalf of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, and their respective Representatives, that the Company and its
Representatives do not have (other than their rights upon Closing) any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account
(each, a " _Claim_ ") and hereby waive any Claim prior to Closing they may
have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with Parent and will not prior to Closing seek
recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever; _provided_ that
(x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's and its
Representatives' right to pursue a claim against Parent for legal relief
against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account or for specific
performance or other equitable relief (including a claim for Parent to
specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and a claim for
Parent to specifically perform its obligations under the Trust Agreement,
including distribution of funds from the Trust Account upon the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and (y) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company or its Representatives
may have in the future against Parent's assets or funds that are not held in
the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust
Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such
funds). This _Section 5.10(a)_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and will not expire and may not be altered in any way prior to the
Closing without the express written consent of Parent.

  



  

(b) Parent covenants that it shall make appropriate arrangements to cause the

any manner other than (i) as expressly provided for by the terms of the
Subscription Agreements or (ii) to reflect any permitted assignments or
transfers of the Subscription Agreements by the applicable PIPE Investors
pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, without the prior written consent of
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that the parties acknowledge that any proposed amendment,
modification or waiver of the Subscription Agreements that affects the
offering price of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Subscription
Agreements may be rejected by the Company in its sole discretion). Each
Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of (x) Parent
and, (y) to Parent's Knowledge, each PIPE Investor party thereto, in each
case, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties thereto, and neither the execution or delivery of such Subscription
Agreement by Parent nor the performance by Parent of its obligations under
any such Subscription Agreement violates or conflicts with any applicable
Laws or Parent Organizational Documents. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and conditions
described therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall give the Company prompt (and, in any event within three (3) Business
Days) written notice: (A) of any proposed amendment to any
Subscription Agreement; (B) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Subscription Agreement
known to Parent; and (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any party to any Subscription Agreement with
respect to any actual, potential or claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal,
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Subscription
Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription Agreement.

occurrence-based insurance policies and resulting in a loss or liability to
the Company Entities or Parent after the Closing, the Company Entities may,
to the extent permitted thereunder and to the extent of such loss or
liability, make claims under such policies so long as such claims are not
reasonably expected to result in non-de minimis increased costs or
Liabilities to Parent. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in the pursuit of such claims.

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not

hereto shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtain any remedy referred

verbal or written statement or action of any party hereto.

of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in any dispute
or controversy between the parties hereto as to whether any obligation, item,
