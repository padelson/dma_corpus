Earnout Shares to the extent provided in _Section 1.13_ hereof;

  



  

(ii) each share of Company Capital Stock held in the treasury of the

(iii) each share of the common stock (par value $0.01 per share) of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) At any time or from time to time between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions set forth in
_Sections 4.2_ and _5.2_ ), if Parent or the Company declares or pays any
dividend on its common stock payable in shares of its common stock or in any
right to acquire shares of such common stock, or effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of such common stock into a greater number of shares of
common stock (by stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and
the like), or if the outstanding shares of its common stock shall be combined
or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares of common stock, then the Parent Share Price (including the dollar
amounts referred to in the definition of Parent Share Price) and the Per
Share Closing Consideration, the Per Share Escrow Consideration, and the value
of the Substitute Option shall each be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall, upon surrender of such
holder's Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Parent Share Price.

  



  

(d) No later than three (3) business days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver the Spreadsheet to Parent and the
Exchange Agent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Spreadsheet_ " means a
spreadsheet which shall include, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time: (i) the names of all Company Stockholders and their respective
addresses, (ii) the number and type of shares of Company Capital Stock held
by each Company Stockholder, and (iii) (A) the names of all holders of Company
Options and their respective addresses, (B) where applicable, the respective
certificate numbers held by each Company Stockholder, and (C) the number of
Parent Common Stock to be paid to each Company Stockholder at Closing in
respect of each type of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Stockholder, (iv) the number and type of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the full exercise of each Company Option held by each such
holder, (vi) the grant date, expiration date, exercise price per share,
vesting schedule and vested status of each Company Option held by each such
holder, (v) a calculation of the Per Share Closing Consideration and the Per
Share Escrow Consideration, and (vi) a calculation of the number of Substitute
Options and adjusted exercise price for each such Company Option, calculated
in accordance with _Section 1.9_ hereto.

  



  

1.6 _Closing of the Company 's Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such Company
Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further
transfer of any such shares of the Company Capital Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a Company Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged for shares
of Parent Common Stock, as provided in _Section 1.5_ and _1.7_.

1.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall
engage Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or, if Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company is unable to be engaged, Parent and the Company shall
agree upon, select and engage another reputable bank, transfer agent or trust
company) to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent stock
certificates representing the Aggregate Closing Shares (for delivery to the
Company Stockholders as provided in _Section 1.5_ and this _Section 1.7_ ) and
the Aggregate Escrow Shares (to be held in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
(1) a Letter of Transmittal and (2) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Company Stock Certificates in exchange for shares of Parent
Common Stock as set forth in this _Section 1.7(b)_. At the Closing, each
Company Stockholder that does not perfect its right of appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to receive payment for its
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5_ of this Agreement (a
" _Merger Stockholder_ ") shall surrender to the Exchange Agent the Company
Stock Certificates representing all of such Merger Stockholder's shares of
Company Capital Stock, properly endorsed for transfer, along with a Letter of
Transmittal. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to (i) each Merger Stockholder who has surrendered Company
Stock Certificates representing all of such Merger Stockholder's shares of
the Company Common Stock properly endorsed for transfer, along with an
executed Letter of Transmittal, a certificate representing the aggregate
number of Closing Shares that such Merger Stockholder has the right to
receive under the provisions of _Section 1.5_ , rounded up to the nearest
whole share, and (ii) the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Merger Stockholders
and holders of Company Options, separate certificates representing the
aggregate number of Escrow Shares that such Merger Stockholder otherwise has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.5_ , rounded up
to the nearest whole share, which Escrow Shares shall be held (and released)
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.5_  and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as
Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

  



  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share
shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this _Section 1.7_.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any
holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to deduct
or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law, if any;  _provided_ , that Parent or Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall make reasonable efforts to give the holder or
former holder of Company Capital Stock notice of the intention to make such
deduction or withholding prior to Closing (or other payment date), and timely
remit to the appropriate Governmental Body any and all amounts so deducted or
withheld and timely file all Tax Returns and provide to any Person such
information statement and other documents required to be filed or provided
under applicable law. For purposes of such deductions and withholdings, one
share of Parent Common Stock shall be equal to the Parent Share Price. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the
appropriate Government Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock for any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any
cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

1.8 _Appraisal Shares_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Appraisal Shares (as defined in _Section 1.8(c)_ below) shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 1.5(a)_ (or cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 1.5(c)_ ), and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares as may
be granted to such holder in Section 262 of the DGCL. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall not have and shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a
stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal Shares
shall fail to perfect or shall waive, rescind, withdraw or otherwise lose
such holder's right of appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) any
right of such holder to require the Company to purchase the Appraisal Shares
for cash shall be extinguished and (ii) in accordance with _Section 1.7(a)_
, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only
the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares) Parent Common Stock, and cash in lieu of any
fractional share in accordance with _Section 1.5(c)_ , if appropriate.

  



  

(b) The Company (i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any
demand by any Company Stockholder for appraisal of such Company
Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL and of any
other notice demand or instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the
DGCL and (ii) shall give Parent's Representatives the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
notice, demand or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer with respect to any such notice or demand unless Parent
shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Appraisal Shares_ " shall
refer to any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by Company Stockholders who are entitled to
demand and who properly demand appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
comply with the applicable provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL.

  



  

1.9 _Treatment of Company Options_.

  



  

(a) Each unexercised Company Option outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by Parent and shall be
converted into (i) a stock option to acquire Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_Substitute Option_ ") on the terms set forth below, without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof, (ii) a contingent right to receive
a portion of the Escrow Shares equal to the product of (A) the Per
Share Escrow Consideration, _times_ (B) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock for which such holder's Company Option is then exercisable,
without regard to vesting (as applicable, the " _Option Shares_ "), and
(iii) a contingent right to receive a portion of the Earnout Shares to the
extent provided in _Section 1.13_ hereof. From and after the Effective Time,
all references to the Company in the Company Option Plans and the applicable
stock option agreements issued thereunder shall be deemed to refer to Parent,
which shall have assumed the Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time.
Each Substitute Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions (including with respect to vesting) as under the
applicable Company Option Plan and the applicable option agreement issued
thereunder, except that (A) each such Substitute Option shall be exercisable
for, and represent the right to acquire, that whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
of (i) the Per Share Closing Consideration, _times_ , (ii) the applicable
Option Shares and (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
shall be an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
exercise price of the Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (ii) the Per Share Closing Consideration; _provided, however_ , that
the exercise price applicable to and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Substitute Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code (the
exercise price per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to the
nearest full cent.

  



  

(b) To the extent a holder of a Substitute Option issued in
accordance herewith continues to hold such Substitute Option after the
Closing, or shall have duly exercised such Substitute Option after the
Closing, then such holder shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of
any distribution of Earnout Shares at the same time as, and as otherwise
provided to, the holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of _Sections 1.13_.

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of Substitute Options an
appropriate notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto. Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Substitute Options pursuant to this _Section 1.9_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, if applicable, the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Substitute Options will be covered by an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or
another appropriate form), and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as Substitute Options remain outstanding.

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Code ยง368\.
The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the Treasury Regulations.

  



  

1.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the
name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise, as the case may
be) to take such action.

  



  

1.12 _Parent Committee; Officers and Directors of Parent_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent shall appoint a
committee (the " _Parent Committee_ ") consisting of three (3) "independent"
directors of Parent as of after the Closing, who shall be agreed to by each of
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, with the chairman of such Parent
Committee to be Stephen Cichy (or his successor as determined by the Parent
Committee). The Parent Committee shall act on behalf of Parent to take all
necessary actions and make all decisions pursuant to (a) the matters set
forth in _Section 1.13_ and (b) the Escrow Agreement and Parent's right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10_ (the " _Post-Closing Matters_ "). In
the event of a vacancy in such committee, the Board of Directors of Parent
shall appoint as a successor a Person who was a director of Parent prior to
the Closing Date or some other Person who would qualify as an "independent"
director of Parent and who has not had any relationship with the Company
prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, such committee shall have
the power and authority to act on behalf of Parent, without any further
approval or consent required from any director, officer or stockholder of
Parent, to take any necessary action and make any necessary decision on
behalf of Parent with respect to the Post-Closing Matters; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such committee shall not have any power or authority with
respect to the conduct or operation of the Company's business after the
Closing, including without limitation any decisions made in respect of such
conduct or operations that would have either a positive or negative impact on
the Company's ability to achieve an EBITDA Threshold for any Calculation
Period. Each member of the Parent Committee shall be entitled to receive all
indemnification and limitation of liability rights granted by Parent to the
members of Parent's Board of Directors.

  



  

(b) Parent covenants to take all actions necessary so that, as of
the Effective Time, the Parent's Board of Directors shall consist of the
directors identified on _Exhibit D_ , including causing the resignation of all
current directors of Parent not specified on such exhibit and causing the
nomination of one (1) individual named by the Company (with the consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no
later than 3 Business Days after receipt of the first SEC comments to the
Proxy/Registration Statement by Parent, or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter (as the initial Class I Director), Stephen P. Griggs and Bruce
Lunsford (as the initial Class II Directors), and Ted Lundberg and Stephen
Cichy (as the initial Class III Directors), for election to the Parent's
Board of Directors at the Parent Stockholder Meeting. From and after the
Closing, Parent will enter into customary indemnification agreements with,
and obtain one or more directors\' and officers' liability insurance policies
covering, in each case, all of the foregoing persons.

(c) Parent covenants to take all actions necessary so that, as of
the Effective Time, the persons set forth on _Exhibit D_ hereto shall be the
officers of Parent from and after the Effective Time, each to hold office in
accordance with certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent until their
respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier
resignation, removal or death.

  



  

1.13 _Earnout Shares_.

  



  

(a) _Earnout Shares_. In addition to the merger consideration
payable in respect of Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5_  and in
respect of Company Options pursuant to _Section 1.9_ , Parent shall be
required to issue additional shares of Parent Common Stock to the Merger
Securityholders as provided in this _Section 1.13_ (such shares, the "
_Earnout Shares_ "). With respect to each Calculation Period, Parent shall
issue to the Exchange Agent (for the benefit of the Merger
Securityholders) 1,196,172 shares of Parent Common Stock if the EBITDA Amount
for such Calculation Period exceeds the applicable EBITDA Threshold for such
Calculation Period. If the EBITDA Amount for a particular Calculation Period
does not exceed the applicable EBITDA Threshold, no Earnout Shares will be
issued for such Calculation Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) if the EBITDA Amount for the 2015
Calculation Period does not equal or exceed the EBITDA Threshold for such 2015
Calculation Period, but the EBITDA Amount for the 2016 Calculation Period
equals or exceeds the EBITDA Threshold for the 2016 Calculation Period, then
the Merger Securityholders shall be entitled to receive 100% of the Earnout
Shares for both the 2015 and 2016 Calculation Periods (i.e., a total of
2,392,344 shares of Parent Common Stock); (B) if the EBITDA Amount for the
2017 Calculation Period equals or exceeds the EBITDA Threshold for the 2017
Calculation Period, but the EBITDA Amount for either or both of the 2015 or
2016 Calculation Periods did not equal or exceed the applicable EBITDA
Threshold for such periods, then the Merger Securityholders shall be
entitled to receive 100% of the Earnout Shares for the 2017 Calculation
Period plus 100% of the Earnout Shares for any prior Calculation Period not
previously earned; (C) if the EBITDA Amount for the 2016 Calculation Period
exceeds the EBITDA Threshold for such period by 10% or more, then the Merger
Securityholders shall automatically earn all of the Earnout Shares payable in
respect of the 2017 Calculation Period (without regard to the Company's
actual results for the 2017 Calculation Period), and the Earnout
Shares otherwise payable for the 2017 Calculation Period shall be paid to the
Merger Securityholders at the same time as which the Earnout Shares are paid
with respect to the 2016 Calculation Period; and (D) immediately prior to, but
subject to the consummation of, a Change of Control Transaction, the maximum
number of Earnout Shares payable to the Merger Securityholders pursuant to
this _Section 1.13_ (less the total number of Earnout Shares that have been
previously issued to the Merger Securityholders) shall be issued to the
Merger Securityholders, whereupon Parent's obligation to issue additional
Earnout Shares in the future under this  _Section 1.13_ shall terminate. Each
Merger Securityholder shall be entitled to receive his, her or its then
applicable Pro Rata Share of any Earnout Shares payable to the Merger
Securityholders pursuant hereto.

(b) Procedures Applicable to Determination of the Earnout Shares.

  



  

(i) Upon the receipt of audited financials of each Calculation
Period (each such date, an " _Earnout Calculation Delivery Date_ "), Parent
Committee shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders' Agent a written
statement (in each case, an " _Earnout Calculation Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail its determination of the EBITDA Amount for the
applicable Calculation Period (in each case, an " _Earnout Calculation_ ").
Parent shall include along with such written statement a copy of the audited
financials for such Calculation Period, and upon request shall promptly
provide the Stockholders' Agent with such other work papers and materials
reasonably related to the Earnout Calculation.

  



  

(ii) The Stockholders' Agent shall have twenty (20) days after
receipt of the Earnout Calculation Statement for each Calculation Period (in
each case, the " _Earnout Review Period_ ") to review the Earnout Calculation
Statement and the Earnout Calculation set forth therein. During the Earnout
Review Period, Stockholders' Agent and its Representatives shall have
the right to inspect the Company's books and records during normal business
hours at the Company's offices, upon reasonable prior notice and solely for
purposes reasonably related to the determination of the EBITDA Amount for the
applicable Calculation Period, and Parent shall provide the Stockholders'
Agent with reasonable access to its chief financial officer and other related
employees who have relevant information. Prior to the expiration of the
Earnout Review Period, Stockholders' Agent may object to the Earnout
Calculation set forth in the Earnout Calculation Statement for the applicable
Calculation Period by delivering a written notice of objection (an " _Earnout
Calculation Objection Notice_ ") to Parent. Any Earnout Calculation Objection
Notice shall specify the items in the applicable Earnout Calculation disputed
by Stockholders' Agent and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for
such objection, as well as the amount in dispute, in each case, to the extent
known. If Stockholders' Agent fails to deliver an Earnout Calculation
Objection Notice to Parent prior to the expiration of the Earnout Review
Period, then the Earnout Calculation set forth in the Earnout Calculation
Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. If Stockholders'
Agent timely delivers an Earnout Calculation Objection Notice, Parent
Committee and Stockholders' Agent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
the disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount of the EBITDA Amount
for the applicable Calculation Period. If Parent Committee and Stockholders'
Agent are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after an Earnout
Calculation Objection Notice has been given, all unresolved disputed items
shall be promptly referred to the Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant shall be directed to render a written report on the
unresolved disputed items with respect to the applicable Earnout Calculation
as promptly as practicable, but in no event greater than thirty (30) days
after such submission to the Independent Accountant, and to resolve only those
unresolved disputed items set forth in the Earnout Calculation Objection
Notice. If unresolved disputed items are submitted to the Independent
Accountant, Parent Committee and Stockholders' Agent shall each furnish to
the Independent Accountant such work papers, schedules and other
documents and information relating to the unresolved disputed items as the
Independent Accountant may reasonably request. The Independent Accountant
shall resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions
and other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by Parent Committee
and Stockholders' Agent, and not by independent review. The resolution of the
dispute and the calculation of the EBITDA Amount that is the subject of the
applicable Earnout Calculation Objection Notice by the Independent Accountant
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by Parent and Stockholders' Agent in
proportion to the amounts by which their respective calculations of the EBITDA
Amount differ from the EBITDA Amount as finally determined by the Independent
Accountant.

(c) _Independence of Earnout Shares_. Parent's obligation to issue
the Earnout Shares to the Exchange Agent (for the benefit of the
Merger Securityholders) with respect to each of the Calculation Periods in
accordance with _Section 1.13(a)_ is an independent obligation of Parent and
is not otherwise conditioned or contingent upon the satisfaction of any
conditions precedent to any preceding or subsequent Earnout Shares.

  



  

(d) _Timing of Issuance of Earnout Shares_. Subject to _Section
1.13(e)_ , any Earnout Shares that Parent is required to issue pursuant to
_Section 1.13(a)_ shall be issued in full to the Exchange Agent (for the
benefit of the Merger Securityholders) no later than 5 business days
following the date upon which the determination of the EBITDA Amount for the
applicable Calculation Period becomes final and binding upon the parties
hereto as provided in _Section 1.13(b)(ii)_ (including any final resolution
of any dispute raised by Stockholders' Agent in an Earnout Calculation
Objection Notice) or, in the case of a Change of Control Transaction, upon
the date which is no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
consummation of such Change of Control Transaction (such date, the " _Earnout
Issuance Date_ ").

  



  

(e) _Right of Set-off_. In the event that it is finally determined
(in accordance with Section 5(c) of the Escrow Agreement) that Parent is
entitled to be indemnified for Damages pursuant to _Section 10_ and the Escrow
Agreement, then if and to the extent the Escrow Shares are insufficient to
fully indemnify Parent with respect to such finally determined Damages (the
amount of such insufficiency, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Parent shall have
the right to withhold and set off against a number of Earnout Shares
otherwise earned by the Merger Securityholders pursuant to _Section 1.13(a)_
that have an aggregate value (assuming, for this purpose, a value per share
of $8.36) equal to the Shortfall Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent
becomes obligated to issue Earnout Shares pursuant hereto at a time when
there is a Parent indemnification claim pending, which claim has not
been finally determined, then Parent's right to withhold and set-off as
described herein shall not apply with respect to such earned Earnout Shares,
and Parent shall issue such earned Earnout Shares promptly in accordance with
the terms of _Section 1.13(d)_.

(f) _No Security_. The parties hereto understand and agree that (i)
the contingent rights to receive any Earnout Shares shall not be represented
by any form of certificate or other instrument, are not transferable, except
as specifically provided herein or by operation of laws relating to descent
and distribution, divorce and community property, and do not constitute an
equity or ownership interest in Parent or the Company; (ii) the Merger
Securityholders shall not have any rights as a securityholder of Parent or
the Company in respect of their contingent right to receive any Earnout
Shares hereunder; and (iii) no interest is payable with respect to any
Earnout Shares. Each Merger Securityholder acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the payments set forth in this _Section 1.13_  are speculative and not
guaranteed and subject to numerous factors outside the control of Parent and
the Company; (ii) none of Parent, Parent's Representatives, the Company nor
any of their respective Affiliates has promised or projected, and no
Merger Securityholder has relied on any statements regarding, any payments
under this _Section 1.13_ or any projected EBITDA Amount for any period
following the Closing; (iii) other than the express covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, Parent's Representatives, the
Company nor any of their respective Affiliates owe any fiduciary duties or any
other duties (express or implied) to maximize the EBITDA Amount in any
applicable Calculation Period; and (iv) the parties hereto solely intend the
express provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual relationship.

within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice thereof by the Company to

(a) Subject to all of the limitations set forth in this _Section 10_
, from and after the Closing Date, the Merger Securityholders, severally but
not jointly, shall hold harmless and indemnify each of Parent, Merger Sub and
their Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors,

and, collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against,

(c) _Limitations._

  



  

(i) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
payment of any amount under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) after such time as the aggregate amount of all
Damages incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_
exceeds the value of the Escrow Shares, valued at the Parent Share Price (such
amount, the " _Cap_ "). Except with respect to breaches of Fundamental
Representations and breaches of covenants or obligations of the Company, the
Escrow Shares held in escrow as contemplated by this Agreement are the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent Indemnified Parties to recover for any
indemnifiable Damages under this Agreement, and once all of the Escrow Shares
have been distributed out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no further
rights to indemnification hereunder except as provided in _Section 10.2(g)_.

  



  

(ii) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
payment of any amount under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) until such time as the total amount of all
Damages that have been directly suffered or incurred by any one or more of
the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of any breach of representation or
warranty by the Company (other than breaches of Fundamental Representations)
exceeds, in the aggregate, the Threshold Amount, in which event the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of such
Damages which exceed the Threshold Amount; subject to the other limitations
herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Threshold Amount_ " means $1.0
million.

  



  

(iii) The Company Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
payment of any amount under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ (other than for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) after such time as the aggregate of all Damages
incurred by the Company Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ exceed
the Cap.

  



  

(iv) The Company Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
payment of any amount under _Section 10.2(b)(i)_ (other than for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) until such time as the total amount of all
Damages that have been directly suffered or incurred by any one or more of
the Company Indemnified Parties in respect of any breach of representation or
warranty by Parent (other than breaches of Fundamental Representations)
exceeds, in the aggregate, the Threshold Amount, in which event the
Company Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification in respect
of such Damages exceeding the Threshold Amount.

  



  

(d) The limitations set forth in _Section 10.2(c)_ shall not apply
in the case of claims based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this _Section 10_ , any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty made on or as of the date of this Agreement
shall be determined without giving effect (both for purposes of determining
whether an inaccuracy or breach has occurred and the amount of Damages
attributable thereto) to any qualifications as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect (or any similar qualification) set forth therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any representation or warranty made on the
Closing Date (including by delivery of the 'bring-down" certificate pursuant
to _Section 7.5(e)_ ), any such qualifications as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect (or any similar qualification) shall be disregarded solely for
purposes of determining the amount of Damages, but shall not be disregarded
for purposes of establishing whether or not an inaccuracy or breach has
occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be deemed to be in
breach of any representations or warranties made by it at the Closing unless
(i) in the case of the Company's Fundamental Representations, such breach was
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) in the
case of any of the Company's representations and warranties (other than its
Fundamental Representations), such breach had or would be reasonably likely to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

  



    

\- 55 -

(f) Each Indemnified Party will take and will cause their respective
Affiliates to take all steps to mitigate and otherwise minimize any Damage to
the maximum extent possible upon and after becoming aware of any event which
would be expected to give rise to any Damage.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 10_ , the Parent Indemnified Parties shall first seek to recover any
indemnification claims under this _Section 10_ from the Escrow Account by
making a claim pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Solely in the
case of claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations and breaches of
covenants or obligations in this Agreement, if the Parent Indemnified Parties
cannot obtain full recovery from the Escrow Account to the extent that all of
the proceeds of the Escrow Account have been released or are the subject of a
previous claim by a Parent Indemnified Party, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall first exercise its right of offset pursuant to _Section 1.13(e)_ , and
thereafter it shall have the right to pursue such indemnification claim under
this _Section 10_ against the Merger Securityholders on a several but not
joint basis pursuant to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in
the Backstop Indemnity Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall a
Merger Securityholder be obligated to indemnify a Parent Indemnified Party for
an amount which exceeds (i) such Merger Stockholder's pro rata share of the
Damages subject to indemnification (with pro rata share based on the shares of
Parent Common Stock and/or Substitute Options received by such Merger
Securityholder relative to the total shares of Parent Common Stock and
Substitute Options received by all Merger Securityholders pursuant to this
Agreement), or (ii) 100% of the total merger consideration paid to such
Merger Securityholders in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock and
Substitute Options under this Agreement (with such shares of Parent Common
Stock, for this purpose, valued at $8.36 per share).

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder
for any Damages consisting of or relating to Taxes (A) with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a
result of any breach of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth herein (other than with respect
to _Sections 2.13(f)_ , _(g)_ and _(j)_ ), (B) as a result of any election
made under Section 338 of the Code or (C) as a result of transactions
occurring on the Closing Date or after the Closing that are not contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(i) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under this
_Section 10_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Loss Tax Benefit (as defined
below), and/or (ii) any insurance proceeds received or receivable by an
Indemnified Party on account of such Losses as follows:

  



    

\- 56 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) For purposes hereof, " _Loss Tax Benefit_ " shall mean the Tax
savings or benefits actually realized in the year in which the Damages occur,
or in the next succeeding year, by such Indemnified Party that are
attributable to any deduction, loss, credit, refund or other reduction in Tax
resulting from or arising out of the circumstances relating to such Damages.

  



  

(ii) An Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Damages by
exhausting any available remedies against insurers to the same extent as they
would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by an Indemnified Party with
respect to any Damages for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (less
the actual costs of obtaining such insurance or other recovery) shall be
promptly delivered to the party who previously suffered the obligation with
respect to the indemnity payment.

  



  

10.3 _No Contribution_. Upon consummation of the Merger, each Merger
Stockholder will be deemed to have waived any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right or remedy against Merger Sub, the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which he, she or it may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.

  



  

10.4 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

  



  

 (a) In order for a Parent Indemnified Party or a Company
Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving any Damages or demand made by any person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice thereof to the Stockholders' Agent, or to Parent, as applicable
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ");  _provided_ , __ that no delay or failure on
the part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the Stockholders' Agent or
Parent, as the case may be, shall relieve an Indemnifying Party from its
obligations hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially
prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice).

  



  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of a Third Party Claim
for which such claim is applicable, to assume the defense thereof at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that
if the Indemnifying Party is the Stockholders' Agent, such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such
Third Party Claim to the extent an injunction or other equitable relief is
sought against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
expressly elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the
time period set forth in this _Section 10.4(b)_ or fails to diligently
prosecute the defense of any Third Party Claim it elects to assume, the
Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate
in the defense, at its own expense, of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available
to an Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. Parent and Stockholders'
Agent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses)
to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may
be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third
Party Claim.

  



    

\- 57 -

--- 

    

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as provided in this
_Section 10.4(c)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within
ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section
10.4(c)_ , it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  



  

10.5 _Release of Escrow Shares_.

  



  

(a) _To Satisfy Indemnification Claims._ Subject to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, in the event that any Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10_ , the Parent
Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the Stockholders' Agent,
request that the Escrow Agent release and transfer to Parent the number of
Escrow Shares having an aggregate value on the date thereof equal to the
amount owed to the Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10_ in
satisfaction of such claim. For purposes hereof, the value of each Escrow
Share shall be equal to the Parent Share Price; provided that
the distributions of any Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account shall only be
made in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) _To the Merger Securityholders_. Subject to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and this _Section 10_ , any portion of the Escrow Shares
remaining in the Escrow Account (other than any Escrow Shares subject to
pending claims of indemnification made on or prior to the Expiration Date)
shall be released on the Expiration Date to those Persons holding of Company
Common Stock and Company Options as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.5_ and _Section 1.7_.

10.6 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing, the rights of
all Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of any claims for breaches
of representations, warranties or covenants or with respect to any other
claims that they may have under or in connection with this Agreement (other
than disputes arising under _Section 1.13_ , which shall be governed
exclusively by the provisions thereof) or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be strictly limited to the rights to indemnification set forth in
_Section 10_ , subject to the limitations and restrictions provided therein,
and such indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
the Parent Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to
any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Parent hereby waives all
other entitlements, rights, remedies, claims and causes of action with
respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in
connection herewith, whether in contract, tort, under any laws at common law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the foregoing shall limit
in any respect a Parent Indemnified Party's rights (a) for an equitable remedy
to the extent provided by _Section 11.10_ herein or (b) in respect of a claim
for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

Stockholder.

certificate of incorporation was not duly amended to change the Termination
Date (as defined therein) from December 26, 2014 to February 26, 2015 or such
earlier date as Parent and the Company may mutually determine, for whatever
reason (including due to Parent's failure to solicit its stockholders to
approve such amendment), then Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for all
expenses related to the PCAOB compliant re-audit of the Company by BDO LLP,

Miami, FL 33133 
 Attention: Chief Executive Officer

  



  

Re: Backstop Indemnity and Release

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization dated as of October 14, 2014, by and among MergeWorthRx Corp.
(" _Parent_ "), Anvil Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ "), AeroCare Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and FFC AeroCare SR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (as such
agreement may hereafter be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from
time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "). Terms used in this Agreement and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1\. _Backstop Indemnity_. For and in consideration of the mutual
agreements made in the Merger Agreement, the undersigned Merger
Securityholder (the " _Indemnitor_ "), hereby agrees that, to the extent the
Escrow Shares are insufficient to pay an indemnification obligation of the
Merger Securityholders pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Merger Agreement in
respect of breaches of Fundamental Representations [or breaches of covenants
or obligations in the Merger Agreement], the Indemnitor shall, severally and
not jointly, hold harmless and indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for
such indemnification obligation, but only to the extent not otherwise paid or
satisfied by the Escrow Shares and Parent's right of set-off pursuant to
Section 1.13(e) of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing obligations of the
Indemnitor in this paragraph are referred to herein as the " _Obligations_."
In addition, Indemnitor shall be permitted to satisfy any Obligation by
transferring shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Transferred Shares_ ") to the
applicable Parent Indemnified Parties. Such Transferred Shares shall be valued
at the Parent Share Price.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Indemnitor
be obligated to indemnify a Parent Indemnified Party for an amount which
exceeds the lesser of (i) such Indemnitor's pro rata share of the Damages
subject to indemnification under this Backstop Indemnity and Release
Agreement (with pro rata share based on the shares of Parent Common Stock
and/or Substitute Options received by such Indemnitor relative to the total
shares of Parent Common Stock and Substitute Options received by all Merger
Securityholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement) (such pro rata share, the "
_Pro Rata Share_ "), and (ii) 100% of the total merger consideration paid to
such Indemnitor in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock and Substitute
Options under the Merger Agreement (with such shares of Parent Common Stock,
for this purpose, valued at the Parent Share Price).

Indemnitor acknowledges that this Backstop Indemnity and Release is one of a
series of similar Backstop Indemnity and Releases (the "
_Backstop Indemnities_ ") provided by certain Merger Securityholders to
Parent in connection with the Merger (including, with respect to certain
Merger Securityholders, in the Letter of Transmittal).

  



  

If a Parent Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Merger Agreement and the Backstop
Indemnities, Parent, on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party, shall
promptly deliver a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholders' Agent.
The Claim Notice shall state (i) the dollar amount of any indemnification
asserted to be owed under Section 10.2 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the
number of Shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Share Price)
necessary to satisfy the indemnification amount owed, (iii) each indemnitor's
Pro Rata Share of such indemnification amount, (iv) a statement of the facts
giving rise to such claim for indemnification, and the specific
representations, warranties or covenants, if any, alleged to have been
breached and (v) that a claim for such indemnification has been made in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (including, but not limited
to, Section 10.2 thereof) and the Backstop Indemnities.

  



  

During the thirty (30) days following the Stockholders' Agent's receipt of
the Claim Notice, the Stockholders' Agent may deliver a written notice to
Parent, on behalf of the Merger Securityholders, disputing any or all of the
claims made in the Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), which such Dispute
Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the dispute and
the portion of the claim stated in the Claim Notice that is the subject of
such dispute (such amount, the " _Disputed Amount_ "). The Stockholders'
Agent shall distribute the Disputed Amount upon receipt of a certified copy of
a final non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,
ordering the distribution of all or a portion of the Disputed Amount, or when
agreed to pursuant to written instructions executed by Parent and the
Stockholders' Agent.

  



  

On the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt by the Stockholders' Agent of
the Claim Notice (or if such day is not a business day, then on the
next successive business day), the Stockholders' Agent shall obtain from each
respective indemnitor under the Backstop Indemnities such indemnitor's Pro
Rata Share in cash or the number of Shares (or some combination thereof)
described in the Claim Notice to Parent, less the Disputed Amount, if any.

The foregoing shall not constitute a release of claims or any other matter with respect to (i) receipt of such number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which a Stockholder is entitled pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, as further set forth in such Stockholder's Letter of Transmittal, (ii) any of the rights of a Stockholder or any obligations of the Released Parties to such Stockholder, in each case arising under the Merger Agreement, (iii) any of the rights of the Stockholder under the Charter Documents to indemnification from the Company for actions or inactions by such Stockholder or any of its Affiliates as a director or officer of the Company, (iv) if Stockholder is an employee of the Company as of the Closing Date, any rights of such Stockholder to payments in respect of such employment, including rights under any Company Plan identified on the Schedule of Exceptions in accordance with the terms of such plan, and (v) any of the rights of Stockholder or any of its Affiliates under or pursuant to written commercial contracts with the Company set forth on the Schedule of Exceptions and unrelated to such Stockholder's status of a stockholder of the Company.

4. _General Provisions_. No waiver of any term or provision of this Backstop Indemnity and Release shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such term or provision or any other term or provision. This Backstop Indemnity and Release constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements, memoranda, arrangements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Backstop Indemnity and Release may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one binding agreement on the parties, notwithstanding that not all parties are signatories to the same counterpart.

ARTICLE V

  



  

 _STOCKHOLDER ACTION_

3. _Number of Directors; Term of Office_. The number of Directors of the Corporation shall be fixed solely and exclusively by resolution duly adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors.

The initial Class I Directors of the Corporation shall be [names]; the initial Class II Directors of the Corporation shall be Stephen P.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Directors elected to each class shall hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation, death or removal.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever, pursuant to the provisions of
Article IV of this Certificate, the holders of any one or more series of
Undesignated Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
series or together with holders of other such series, to elect Directors
at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of
office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall
be governed by the terms of this Certificate and any certificate of
designations applicable to such series.

  



  

4. _Vacancies_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect Directors and to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors relating thereto, any and all vacancies in the Board of Directors, however occurring, including, without limitation, by reason of an increase in the size of the Board of Directors, or the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of a Director, shall be filled solely and exclusively by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any Director appointed in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such Director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation, death or removal. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect Directors, when the number of Directors is increased or decreased, the Board of Directors shall, subject to Article VI.3 hereof, determine the class or classes to which the increased or decreased number of Directors shall be apportioned; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no decrease in the number of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent Director. In the event of a vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, except as otherwise provided by law, shall exercise the powers of the full Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.

At least forty-five (45) days prior to any annual or special meeting of stockholders at which it is proposed that any Director be removed from office, written notice of such proposed removal and the alleged grounds thereof shall be sent to the Director whose removal will be considered at the meeting.

  



  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

 _LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_

  



  

A Director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a Director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the Director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (d) for any
transaction from which the Director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended after the effective date of this Certificate to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
Directors, then the liability of a Director of the Corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so
amended.

  



  

Any amendment, repeal or modification of this Article VII by either of (i)
the stockholders of the Corporation or (ii) an amendment to the DGCL, shall
not adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such
amendment, repeal or modification with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring before such amendment, repeal or modification of a person
serving as a Director at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
DGCL, as the same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all
persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said section from and
against any and all of the expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to
in or covered by said section, and the indemnification provided for herein
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified
may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity while holding such office and to action while serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person; provided, however, that the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. In connection with the indemnification provided
by Section 145 of the DGCL and under any by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, expenses incurred by a
director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending
action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation in accordance with Section 145 of the DGCL or
as authorized in the by-laws of the Corporation.

If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation
and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this
Article VIII with respect to any action, suit, proceeding, or investigation
arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions, or facts occurring
prior to the date of such merger or consolidation.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

 _EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION_

  



  

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or employee of the Corporation
to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action
asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director, officer, or
employee of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or
this Amended and Restated Certificate or the Corporation's bylaws, or (iv)
any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director,
officer, or employee of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs
doctrine of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over
any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or
proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State
of Delaware. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the
Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the foregoing provisions. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article IX.

 _AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION_

  



  

The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal this Certificate in the

(3) A stockholder providing Timely Notice of nominations or business
proposed to be brought before an Annual Meeting shall further update and
supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information (including,
without limitation, the Material Ownership Interests information) provided or
required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this By-law shall be true

(4) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Article I,
Section 2(a)(2) of this By-law to the contrary, in the event that the
number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the
Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of
the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of
Directors made by the Corporation at least ten (10) days before the last day
a stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the second
sentence of Article I, Section 2(a)(2), a stockholder's notice required by
this By-law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be
received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _General_.

  



  

(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
provisions of this By-law shall be eligible for election and to serve
as directors and only such business shall be conducted at an Annual Meeting
as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the
provisions of this By-law or in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange
Act. The Board of Directors or a designated committee thereof shall have the
power to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought
before the meeting was made in accordance with the provisions of this By-law.
If neither the Board of Directors nor such designated committee makes a
determination as to whether any stockholder proposal or nomination was made in
accordance with the provisions of this By-law, the presiding officer of the
Annual Meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether the
stockholder proposal or nomination was made in accordance with the provisions
of this By-law. If the Board of Directors or a designated committee thereof or
the presiding officer, as applicable, determines that any stockholder
proposal or nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this
By-law, such proposal or nomination shall be disregarded and shall not be
presented for action at the Annual Meeting.

  



  

(2) Except as otherwise required by law, nothing in this Article I,
Section 2 shall obligate the Corporation or the Board of Directors to include
in any proxy statement or other stockholder communication distributed on
behalf of the Corporation or the Board of Directors information with respect
to any nominee for director or any other matter of business submitted by a
stockholder.

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article I,
Section 2, if the nominating or proposing stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the Annual Meeting to
present a nomination or any business, such nomination or business shall be
disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Article I, Section 2,
to be considered a qualified representative of the proposing stockholder, a
person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such
stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act
for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person
must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a
reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, to
the presiding officer at the meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(4) For purposes of this By-law, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this By-law, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this By-law. Nothing in this By-law shall be deemed to affect any
rights of (i) stockholders to have proposals included in the Corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor rule), as
applicable, under the Exchange Act and, to the extent required by such rule,
have such proposals considered and voted on at an Annual Meeting or (ii) the
holders of any series of Undesignated Preferred Stock to elect
directors under specified circumstances.

  



  

SECTION 3. _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by
statute and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of
Undesignated Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a
resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors
then in office. The Board of Directors may postpone or reschedule any
previously scheduled special meeting of stockholders. Only those matters set
forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at
a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation. Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and stockholder
proposals of other business shall not be brought before a special meeting of
stockholders to be considered by the stockholders unless such special meeting
is held in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with
Article I, Section 1 of these By-laws, in which case such special meeting in
lieu thereof shall be deemed an Annual Meeting for purposes of these By-laws
and the provisions of Article I, Section 2 of these By-laws shall govern such
special meeting.

  



  

SECTION 4. _Notice of Meetings; Adjournments_.

  



  

(a) A notice of each Annual Meeting stating the hour, date and
place, if any, of such Annual Meeting and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be given not less
than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the Annual Meeting, to
each stockholder entitled to vote thereat by delivering such notice to such
stockholder or by mailing it, postage prepaid, addressed to such stockholder
at the address of such stockholder as it appears on the Corporation's stock
transfer books. Without limiting the manner by which notice may otherwise be
given to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic
transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL").

  



    

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Notice of all special meetings of stockholders shall be given in
the same manner as provided for Annual Meetings, except that the notice of
all special meetings shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
has been called.

  



  

(c) Notice of an Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders
need not be given to a stockholder if a waiver of notice is executed,
or waiver of notice by electronic transmission is provided, before or after
such meeting by such stockholder or if such stockholder attends such meeting,
unless such attendance is for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

(d) The Board of Directors may postpone and reschedule any
previously scheduled Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders and
any record date with respect thereto, regardless of whether any notice or
public disclosure with respect to any such meeting has been sent or made
pursuant to Section 2 of this Article I of these By-laws or otherwise. In no
event shall the public announcement of an adjournment, postponement or
rescheduling of any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders commence a
new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice under this Article I
of these By-laws.

  



  

(e) When any meeting is convened, the presiding officer may adjourn
the meeting if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of business, (ii)
the Board of Directors determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate
to enable the stockholders to consider fully information which the Board of
Directors determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to
stockholders, or (iii) the Board of Directors determines that adjournment is
otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation. When any Annual Meeting
or special meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another hour, date or
place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting other than an
announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken of the hour,
date and place, if any, to which the meeting is adjourned and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting; provided,
however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days from the
meeting date, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat and each stockholder
who, by law or under the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as
the same may hereafter be amended and/or restated, the "Certificate") or
these By-laws, is entitled to such notice.

SECTION 5. _Quorum_. A majority of the shares entitled to vote,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of stockholders. If less than a quorum is present at a meeting, the
holders of voting stock representing a majority of the voting power present
at the meeting or the presiding officer may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice, except
as provided in Section 4 of this Article I. At such adjourned meeting at
which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders
present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum.

  



  

SECTION 6. _Voting and Proxies_. Stockholders shall have one vote
for each share of stock entitled to vote owned by them of record according
to the stock ledger of the Corporation as of the record date, unless
otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate. Stockholders may vote either
(i) in person, (ii) by written proxy or (iii) by a transmission permitted by
Section 212(c) of the DGCL. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission permitted by Section
212(c) of the DGCL may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original
writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original
writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission. Proxies shall be filed in
accordance with the procedures established for the meeting of stockholders.
Except as otherwise limited therein or as otherwise provided by law, proxies
authorizing a person to vote at a specific meeting shall entitle the persons
authorized thereby to vote at any adjournment of such meeting, but they shall
not be valid after final adjournment of such meeting. A proxy with respect to
stock held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by
or on behalf of any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise of the
proxy the Corporation receives a specific written notice to the contrary from
any one of them.

  



  

SECTION 7. _Action at Meeting_. When a quorum is present at any
meeting of stockholders, any matter before any such meeting (other than an
election of a director or directors) shall be decided by a majority of the
votes properly cast for and against such matter, except where a larger vote
is required by law, by the Certificate or by these By-laws. Any election of
directors by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes
properly cast on the election of directors.

  



  

SECTION 8. _Stockholder Lists_. The Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary (or the Corporation's transfer agent or other person authorized by
these By-laws or by law) shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days
before every Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders, a complete
list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for a period of at least ten
(10) days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. The list shall
also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of
the meeting as provided by law.

SECTION 9. _Presiding Officer_. The Board of Directors shall
designate a representative to preside over all Annual Meetings or special
meetings of stockholders, provide that if the Board of Directors does not so
designate such a presiding officer, then the Chairman of the Board, if one is
elected, shall preside over such meetings. If the Board of Directors does not
so designate such a presiding officer and there is no Chairman of the Board
or the Chairman of the Board is unable to so preside or is absent, then the
Chief Executive Officer, if one is elected, shall preside over such meetings,
provided further that if there is no Chief Executive Officer or the
Chief Executive Officer is unable to so preside or is absent, then the
President shall preside over such meetings. The presiding officer at any
Annual Meeting or special meeting of stockholders shall have the power, among
other things, to adjourn such meeting at any time and from time to time,
subject to Sections 4 and 5 of this Article I. The order of business and all
other matters of procedure at any meeting of the stockholders shall be
determined by the presiding officer.

  



  

SECTION 10. _Inspectors of Elections_. The Corporation shall, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act
at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may
designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any
inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a
meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Any inspector may, but need not, be an
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation. Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath
faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and
according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall perform
such duties as are required by the DGCL, including the counting of all votes
and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities
to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors.
The presiding officer may review all determinations made by the inspectors,
and in so doing the presiding officer shall be entitled to exercise his
or her sole judgment and discretion and he or she shall not be bound by any
determinations made by the inspectors. All determinations by the inspectors
and, if applicable, the presiding officer, shall be subject to further review
by any court of competent jurisdiction.

Board of Directors shall be held, without notice other than this Section 7,

Directors may be held at such hour, date and place as the Board of Directors
may by resolution from time to time determine and publicize by means of
reasonable notice given to any director who is not present at the meeting at
which such resolution is adopted.

  



  

SECTION 8. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called, orally or in writing, by or at the request of a

when hand-delivered to such address, read to such director by telephone,
deposited in the mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid if mailed,
dispatched or transmitted if sent by facsimile transmission or by electronic
mail or other form of electronic communications. A written waiver of
notice signed before or after a meeting by a director and filed with the
records of the meeting shall be deemed to be equivalent to notice of the
meeting. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because such meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate or by these
By-laws, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver
of notice of such meeting.

Directors or the Chief Executive Officer may from time to time designate.

  



  

SECTION 15. _Secretary and Assistant Secretaries_. The Secretary
shall record all the proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders and the
Board of Directors (including committees of the Board of Directors) in books
kept for that purpose. In his or her absence from any such meeting, a
temporary secretary chosen at the meeting shall record the proceedings
thereof. The Secretary shall have charge of the stock ledger (which may,
however, be kept by any transfer or other agent of the Corporation). The
Secretary shall have custody of the seal of the Corporation, and the
Secretary, or an Assistant Secretary shall have authority to affix it to any
instrument requiring it, and, when so affixed, the seal may be attested by
his or her signature or that of an Assistant Secretary. The Secretary shall
have such other duties and powers as may be designated from time to time by
the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. In the absence of the
Secretary, any Assistant Secretary may perform his or her duties and
responsibilities. Any Assistant Secretary shall have such powers and perform

SECTION 16. _Other Powers and Duties_. Subject to these By-laws and
to such limitations as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe, the officers of the Corporation shall each have such powers and
duties as generally pertain to their respective offices, as well as such
powers and duties as from time to time may be conferred by the Board of
Directors or the Chief Executive Officer.

  



  

 _ARTICLE IV_

  



  

 _Capital Stock_

  



  

SECTION 1. _Certificates of Stock_. Each stockholder shall be
entitled to a certificate of the capital stock of the Corporation in such form
as may from time to time be prescribed by the Board of Directors. Such
certificate shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President or a
Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. The Corporation seal and the signatures
by the Corporation's officers, the transfer agent or the registrar may be
facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed on such certificate shall
have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
time of its issue. Every certificate for shares of stock which are subject to
any restriction on transfer and every certificate issued when the Corporation
is authorized to issue more than one class or series of stock shall contain
such legend with respect thereto as is required by law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in these Bylaws, the Board
of Directors of the Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that
some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be
uncertificated shares (except that the foregoing shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Corporation), and by the approval and adoption of these Bylaws the Board of
Directors has determined that all classes or series of the Corporation's stock
may be uncertificated, whether upon original issuance, re-issuance, or
subsequent transfer.

  



  

SECTION 2. _Transfers_. Subject to any restrictions on transfer and
unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shares of stock that are
represented by a certificate may be transferred on the books of the
Corporation by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the
certificate theretofore properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
assignment or power of attorney properly executed, with transfer stamps (if
necessary) affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as
the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require. Shares of stock
that are not represented by a certificate may be transferred on the books of
the Corporation by submitting to the Corporation or its transfer agent such
evidence of transfer and following such other procedures as the Corporation
or its transfer agent may require.

SECTION 3. _Record Holders_. Except as may otherwise be required by
law, by the Certificate or by these By-laws, the Corporation shall be
entitled to treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the
owner of such stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and
the right to vote with respect thereto, regardless of any transfer, pledge or
other disposition of such stock, until the shares have been transferred on
the books of the Corporation in accordance with the requirements of these By-
laws.

  



  

SECTION 4. _Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which record date: (a) in the case of determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, shall, unless otherwise
required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days
before the date of such meeting and (b) in the case of any other action, shall
not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record
date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining
stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

SECTION 5. _Replacement of Certificates_. In case of the alleged
loss, destruction or mutilation of a certificate of stock of the Corporation,
a duplicate certificate may be issued in place thereof, upon such terms as
the Board of Directors may prescribe.

SECTION 2. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the operation of Section 4 of this Article V of these
By-laws, each Director and Officer shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), and to the extent authorized in this Section
2.

  



  

(1) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than By or In the Right of
the Corporation_. Each Director and Officer shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation against any and all Expenses and Liabilities that
are incurred or paid by such Director or Officer or on such Director's or
Officer's behalf in connection with any Proceeding or any claim, issue or
matter therein (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation),
which such Director or Officer is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or
participant in by reason of such Director's or Officer's Corporate Status, if
such Director or Officer acted in good faith and in a manner such Director or
Officer reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

  



  

(2) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings By or In the Right of the
Corporation_. Each Director and Officer shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation against any and all Expenses that are incurred by
such Director or Officer or on such Director's or Officer's behalf in
connection with any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein by or in
the right of the Corporation, which such Director or Officer is, or is
threatened to be made, a party to or participant in by reason of such
Director's or Officer's Corporate Status, if such Director or Officer acted
in good faith and in a manner such Director or Officer reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; provided,
however, that no indemnification shall be made under this Section 2(a)(2) in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Director or Officer
shall have been finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of
Chancery or another court in which such Proceeding was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite adjudication of liability, but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such Director or Officer is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such Expenses that such court
deems proper.

  



  

(3) _Survival of Rights_. The rights of indemnification provided by
this Section 2 shall continue as to a Director or Officer after he or she has
ceased to be a Director or Officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives.

  



  

(4) _Actions by Directors or Officers_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Corporation shall indemnify any Director or Officer seeking
indemnification in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director or
Officer only if such Proceeding (including any parts of such Proceeding not
initiated by such Director or Officer) was authorized in advance by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation, unless such Proceeding was brought to
enforce such Officer's or Director's rights to indemnification or, in the case
of Directors, advancement of Expenses under these By-laws in accordance with
the provisions set forth herein.

  



    

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

SECTION 3. _Indemnification of Non-Officer Employees_. Subject to
the operation of Section 4 of this Article V of these By-laws, each Non-
Officer Employee may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
against any or all Expenses and Liabilities that are incurred by such Non-
Officer Employee or on such Non-Officer Employee's behalf in connection with
any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, or any claim, issue or
matter therein, which such Non-Officer Employee is, or is threatened to be
made, a party to or participant in by reason of such Non-Officer Employee's
Corporate Status, if such Non-Officer Employee acted in good faith and in a
manner such Non-Officer Employee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The rights of indemnification provided by this Section 3 shall
exist as to a Non-Officer Employee after he or she has ceased to be a Non-
Officer Employee and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, personal
representatives, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Corporation may indemnify any Non-Officer Employee seeking
indemnification in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Non-
Officer Employee only if such Proceeding was authorized in advance by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 4. _Determination_. Unless ordered by a court, no
indemnification shall be provided pursuant to this Article V to a Director, to
an Officer or to a Non-Officer Employee unless a determination shall have
been made that such person acted in good faith and in a manner such
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, such person had
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Such
determination shall be made by (a) a majority vote of the Disinterested
Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, (b) a
committee comprised of Disinterested Directors, such committee having been
designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (even
though less than a quorum), (c) if there are no such Disinterested Directors,
or if a majority of Disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 5. _Advancement of Expenses to Directors Prior to Final
Disposition_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on
behalf of any Director in connection with any Proceeding in which
such Director is involved by reason of such Director's Corporate Status
within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a written
statement from such Director requesting such advance or advances from time to
time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such
statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by
such Director and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Director to repay any Expenses so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Director is not entitled to be
indemnified against such Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of any
Director seeking advancement of expenses hereunder in connection with a
Proceeding initiated by such Director only if such Proceeding (including any
parts of such Proceeding not initiated by such Director) was (i) authorized
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or (ii) brought to enforce such
Director's rights to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under these
By-laws.

  



    

18 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If a claim for advancement of Expenses hereunder by a Director
is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after receipt
by the Corporation of documentation of Expenses and the required undertaking,
such Director may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and if successful in whole or in
part, such Director shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting such claim. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such
advancement of Expenses under this Article V shall not be a defense to an
action brought by a Director for recovery of the unpaid amount of an
advancement claim and shall not create a presumption that such advancement is
not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director is not entitled to an
advancement of expenses shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

(c) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Director
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
DGCL.

  



  

SECTION 6. _Advancement of Expenses to Officers and Non-Officer
Employees Prior to Final Disposition_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors
of the Corporation, advance any or all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of
any Officer or any Non-Officer Employee in connection with any Proceeding in
which such person is involved by reason of his or her Corporate Status as an
Officer or Non-Officer Employee upon the receipt by the Corporation of a
statement or statements from such Officer or Non-Officer Employee requesting
such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after
final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Officer or Non-Officer
Employee and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on
behalf of such person to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Officer or Non-Officer Employee is not
entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.

  



  

(b) In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Officer
or Non-Officer Employee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

  



    

19

--- 

    



  

SECTION 7. _Contractual Nature of Rights_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this Article V shall be deemed to be a
contract between the Corporation and each Director and Officer entitled to
the benefits hereof at any time while this Article V is in effect, in
consideration of such person's past or current and any future performance of
services for the Corporation. Neither amendment, repeal or modification of any
provision of this Article V nor the adoption of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article V shall eliminate
or reduce any right conferred by this Article V in respect of any act or
omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim that accrues or arises or
any state of facts existing, at the time of or before such amendment, repeal,
modification or adoption of an inconsistent provision (even in the case of a
proceeding based on such a state of facts that is commenced after such time),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses granted herein
or arising out of any act or omission shall vest at the time of the act or
omission in question, regardless of when or if any proceeding with respect to
such act or omission is commenced. The rights to indemnification and to
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article
V shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director
or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate,
heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributes of such person.

  



  

(b) If a claim for indemnification hereunder by a Director or
Officer is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days
after receipt by the Corporation of a written claim for indemnification, such
Director or Officer may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in
whole or in part, such Director or Officer shall also be entitled to be paid
the expenses of prosecuting such claim. The failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors or any committee thereof, independent legal
counsel, or stockholders) to make a determination concerning the
permissibility of such indemnification under this Article V shall not be a
defense to an action brought by a Director or Officer for recovery of the
unpaid amount of an indemnification claim and shall not create a presumption
that such indemnification is not permissible. The burden of proving that a
Director or Officer is not entitled to indemnification shall be on the
Corporation.

  



  

(c) In any suit brought by a Director or Officer to enforce a right
to indemnification hereunder, it shall be a defense that such Director or
Officer has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in
the DGCL.

  



  

SECTION 8. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to
indemnification and to advancement of Expenses set forth in this Article V
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Director, Officer, or
Non-Officer Employee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Certificate or these By-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise.

  



  

SECTION 9. _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at
its expense, to protect itself and any Director, Officer or Non-Officer
Employee against any liability of any character asserted against or incurred
by the Corporation or any such Director, Officer or Non-Officer Employee, or
arising out of any such person's Corporate Status, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the DGCL or the provisions of this Article V.

  



    

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

SECTION 10. _Other Indemnification_. The Corporation's obligation,
if any, to indemnify or provide advancement of Expenses to any person under
this Article V as a result of such person serving, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as
indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise (the
"Primary Indemnitor"). Any indemnification or advancement of Expenses under
this Article V owed by the Corporation as a result of a person serving, at the
request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall only be in excess of, and
shall be secondary to, the indemnification or advancement of
Expenses available from the applicable Primary Indemnitor(s) and any
applicable insurance policies.

executive committee of the Board may authorize.

  



  

SECTION 4. _Voting of Securities_. Unless the Board of Directors
otherwise provides, the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, the

Corporation, or appoint another person or persons to act as proxy or attorney
in fact for the Corporation with or without discretionary power and/or power
of substitution, at any meeting of stockholders or shareholders of any other
corporation or organization, any of whose securities are held by the
Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 5. _Resident Agent_. The Board of Directors may appoint a
resident agent upon whom legal process may be served in any action or

owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a
claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation
Law or the Certificate or By-laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Section 8.

  



  

SECTION 9. _Amendment of By-laws_.

on such amendment or repeal, voting together as a single class; provided,
however, that if the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve

forth herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

1.   _Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

2.   _Escrow Account_.

  



  

(a) On or as soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent will
cause 1,016,746 shares of common stock of Parent, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), which shares shall be registered in the name
of Escrow Agent f/b/o the Merger Securityholders (the " _Escrow Shares_ "),
to be delivered to the Escrow Agent in book-entry form, and the Escrow Agent
will acknowledge receipt of the Escrow Shares to Parent and the Stockholders'
Agent promptly upon receipt thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Shares and
shall invest, reinvest and manage any cash proceeds thereof as directed in
_Section 3(d)_ (the " _Proceeds_ _,_ " and the Escrow Shares and the
Proceeds, collectively, the " _Escrow Account_ "). Upon receipt of the
Escrow Shares, the Escrow Agent shall not release the Escrow Shares or the
rest of the Escrow Account except in accordance with this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) If Parent at any time or from time to time between the date of
this Escrow Agreement and the final disposition of the Escrow Account in
accordance with this Escrow Agreement, (i) subdivides (by any stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (ii) combines (by
reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then Parent will deliver notice thereof
to the Escrow Agent, and, unless the applicable authorizing resolutions of
the Board do not require delivery of new Escrow Shares as a result of such
action, the Parent will as promptly as practicable after the effective date
with respect thereto deliver to the Escrow Agent in book-entry form the
requisite Escrow Shares as may be required to reflect the applicable increase
or reduction, as the case may be, of such Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to execute and deliver any transmittal letter or other
documents and share certificates required to effectuate an exchange of shares
if contemplated by the action taken pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) or
(ii). If Parent at any time or from time to time between the date of this
Escrow Agreement and the final disposition of the Escrow Account in
accordance with this Escrow Agreement pays any distribution or dividend in
respect of the Escrow Shares in additional shares of Parent Common Stock,
then Parent will deliver notice thereof to the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholders' Agent, and, unless the applicable authorizing resolutions of
the Board do not require delivery of additional Escrow Shares as a result of
such action, the Parent will as promptly as practicable after the payment date
with respect thereto deliver to the Escrow Agent additional Escrow Shares
representing such additional shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon such delivery
referred to in this  _Section 2(b)_ , the Escrow Agent shall hold such
additional or substitute Escrow Shares, and all such shares are deemed
Escrow Shares for purposes of this Escrow Agreement.

  



    

\- 2 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) This Agreement assumes that the Escrow Account will at all times
be comprised only of Parent Common Stock and/or cash. If the Parent Common
Stock is converted into any securities or other property other than Parent
Common Stock, or any securities or other property (in each case, other than
cash or additional shares of Parent Common Stock) are distributed, issued or
exchanged with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (then held in the
Escrow Account) upon any recapitalization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation, stock dividend or the like, or if for any other reason
securities or other property (in each case, other than cash or
additional shares of Parent Common Stock) at any time are held in the Escrow
Account, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall negotiate in good faith,
and execute and deliver, such supplemental written instructions to the Escrow
Agent as are necessary to account for such other securities or property in a
manner consistent with the results that would have prevailed if only Parent
Common Stock and/or cash were held in the Escrow Account, and shall deliver
such supplemental written instructions to the Escrow Agent. If the Parties
are unable to agree on any such supplemental instructions contemplated by the
preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after such sentence shall become
applicable, then the Escrow Agent shall refrain from taking any action with
respect to such property other than Parent Common Stock and/or cash, other
than to keep safely such other property until it shall be directed
otherwise in writing jointly by Parent and the Stockholders' Agent or by
final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to execute and deliver any transmittal letter or other
documents and Escrow Shares required in connection with such any
recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or similar event to
receive any shares of stock, securities, properties or cash in exchange for
Escrow Shares.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein
and for so long as the Escrow Shares remain in the Escrow Account, the
Parties agree that the Merger Securityholders shall have the right to (i) vote
all Escrow Shares that are not disbursed to Parent pursuant to the terms
hereof, (ii) receive any cash dividends and cash distributions in respect of
the Escrow Shares that are not disbursed to Parent pursuant to the terms
hereof, and (iii) except as set forth in Section 2(e) below, exercise any and
all other rights of a shareholder of Parent with respect to the Escrow Shares
that are not disbursed to Parent pursuant to the terms hereof; provided
_however,_ that Parent shall not be obligated to recognize any sale of Escrow
Shares to a third party prior to the termination of this Escrow Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to
the extent that Parent makes any non-cash distributions or non-cash dividends
in respect of the Escrow Shares while such Escrow Shares remain in the Escrow
Account, such distributions and dividends shall be deposited into the Escrow
Account by Parent. Upon any disbursement of the Escrow Shares to Parent or the
Merger Securityholders pursuant to Sections 4 or 5 (as the case may be), the
non-cash distributions and non-cash dividends held in the Escrow Account in
respect of such disbursed Escrow Shares shall be disbursed to the Party
receiving such disbursed Escrow Shares.

  



  

3.   _Investment of Escrow Account_.

  



  

(a) The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will not
provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either
the investment of moneys or any other assets held in the Escrow Account or
the purchase, sale, retention or other disposition of any investment
described herein. The Escrow Agent shall not liquidate, sell, invest or
reinvest any portion of the Escrow Account except as provided herein and
shall hold the Escrow Shares and any cash or other assets received in respect
thereof in the form initially received, except as provided herein. The Escrow
Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any
investment or the failure to make an investment made pursuant to the terms of
this Escrow Agreement.

  



    

\- 3 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) During the term of this Escrow Agreement, any cash in the Escrow
Account shall be invested in a money market deposit account or a successor or
similar investment offered by the Escrow Agent and approved by the
Stockholders' Agent and Parent, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the
Parties and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent will provide compensation on balances in the Escrow Account at the
then-applicable rate for such account or investment from time to time. Written
investment instructions, if any, shall specify the type and identity of the
investments to be purchased and/or sold. The Escrow Agent is
hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of investments through the
facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations or those of any
affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive
reasonable compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder
including without limitation charging a reasonable agency fee in connection
with each transaction. The Parties recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent
will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to
either the investment of moneys held in the Escrow Account or the purchase,
sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein. The
Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result
of any investment in an investment made pursuant to the terms of this Escrow
Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its
maturity or for the failure of the Parties to give the Escrow Agent
instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Account.

  



  

4.   _Disbursement of Escrow Account_. The Parties agree that the Escrow Account is available to satisfy the Merger Securityholders' indemnification obligations set forth in Section 10 of the Merger Agreement. On the next successive business day after the Claims Deadline (as defined below), the Escrow Agent shall release all of the Escrow Account to Exchange Agent for the benefit of the Merger Securityholders, less any unresolved Dispute Amounts (as defined below) and any amounts previously released in accordance with _Section 5_ hereof.

  



  

5.   _Indemnification Claims_.

  



  

(a) If a Parent Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10 of the Merger Agreement, Parent,
on behalf of such Parent Indemnified Party, shall promptly deliver a notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholders' Agent and the Escrow Agent. The
Claim Notice shall state (i) the dollar amount of any indemnification asserted
to be owed under Section 10 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the number of
Escrow Shares necessary to satisfy the indemnification amount owed, (iii) a
statement of the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification, and the
specific representations, warranties or covenants, if any, alleged to have
been breached, and (iv) that a claim for such indemnification has been made in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (including, but not limited
to, Section 10 thereof).

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5(c)_ , on the thirtieth (30th) day
following receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Claim Notice (or if such day
is not a business day, then on the next successive business day), the Escrow
Agent shall release the number of Escrow Shares described in the Claim Notice
to Parent from the Escrow Account, less the amount, if any, described in a
Dispute Notice (as defined below). If the Escrow Account contains both Escrow
Shares and cash, any such payment shall be made to Parent in Escrow Shares and
cash, such that the ratio of cash paid to Escrow Shares released is equal to
the ratio of cash to Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account as of the date of
such payment. For purposes of distributing the Escrow Account pursuant to the
terms hereof, the Escrow Shares shall be valued at the Parent Share Price.

  



    

\- 4 - 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) During the thirty (30) days following the Escrow Agent's receipt
of the Claim Notice, the Stockholders' Agent may deliver a written notice to
the Escrow Agent and Parent disputing any or all of the claims made in the
Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "), which such Dispute Notice shall state
with reasonable specificity the nature of the dispute and the portion of the
claim stated in the Claim Notice that is the subject of such dispute (such
amount, the " _Disputed Amount_ "). The Escrow Agent shall not distribute the
Disputed Amount until (i) the Escrow Agent receives a certified copy of a
final non-appealable judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,
ordering the distribution of all or a portion of the Disputed Amount, or (ii)
directed to do so pursuant to written instructions executed by Parent and the
Stockholders' Agent. The rights of the Escrow Agent under this _Section 5(c)_
are cumulative of all other rights it may have by law or otherwise. Any claim
by Parent disputed by the Stockholders' Agent pursuant to this _Section 5(c)_
, or any claim by Parent which the Escrow Agent has refused to comply with or
take any action in connection with in accordance with this _Section 5(c)_ ,
shall be referred to herein as a " _Disputed Claim_." The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable in any way or to any Person for its failure or refusal to
release such Disputed Amount.

  



  

(d) Promptly following resolution of all or any portion of a
Disputed Claim in favor of the former Merger Securityholders, Parent shall
provide written notice to the Escrow Agent that such Disputed Claim or
portion thereof has been discharged, and to the extent any amounts are being
withheld from being disbursed to the Exchange Agent pursuant to the last
sentence of _Section 4_ by the Escrow Agent in respect of such Disputed
Claim, such amount shall promptly be released to the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(e) The Parties agree that Parent shall have the right to make
claims against the Escrow Account on behalf of itself and any of the
other Parent Indemnified Parties until the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (the " _Claims Deadline_ ").

  



  

6.   _Disposition and Termination_. Upon delivery of the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Sections 4_ and _5_ above, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate, subject to the provisions of _Sections 7(b)_ , _7(c)_ , _7(g)_ and _8_.

  



  

7.   _Concerning the Escrow Agent_.

  



  

(a) _Good Faith Reliance_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in the exercise of its
own best judgment, and may rely conclusively and shall be protected in acting
upon any order, notice, demand, certificate, opinion or advice of counsel
(including counsel chosen by the Escrow Agent, which counsel may be company
counsel), statement, instrument, report or other paper or document (not only
as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its provisions,
but also as to the truth and acceptability of any information therein
contained) which is reasonably believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine and
to be signed or presented by the proper person or persons. The Escrow Agent
shall not be bound by any notice or demand, or any waiver, modification,
termination or rescission of this Escrow Agreement unless evidenced by a
writing delivered to the Escrow Agent signed by the proper party or parties
and, if the duties or rights of the Escrow Agent are affected, unless it
shall have given its prior written consent thereto.

(b) _Indemnification_. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified and
held harmless by Parent from and against any expenses, including reasonable
counsel fees and disbursements, or loss suffered by the Escrow Agent in
connection with any action taken by it hereunder, action, suit or
other proceeding involving any claim which in any way, directly or
indirectly, arises out of or relates to this Escrow Agreement, the services
of the Escrow Agent hereunder, or the Escrow Account held by it hereunder,
other than expenses or losses arising from the fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. Promptly after the receipt by the
Escrow Agent of notice of any demand or claim or the commencement of any
action, suit or proceeding, the Escrow Agent shall notify the other parties
hereto in writing. In the event of the receipt of such notice, the Escrow
Agent, in its sole discretion, may commence an action in the nature of
interpleader in an appropriate court to determine ownership or disposition of
the Escrow Account or it may deposit the Escrow Account with the clerk of any
appropriate court or it may retain the Escrow Account pending receipt of a
final, non-appealable order of a court having jurisdiction over all of the
parties hereto directing to whom and under what circumstances the Escrow
Account are to be disbursed and delivered. The provisions of this _Section
7(b)_ shall survive in the event the Escrow Agent resigns or is discharged
pursuant to _Sections 7(e)_ or _7(f)_ below.

  



  

(c) _Compensation_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to such
compensation from Parent for all services rendered by it hereunder set forth

paid or incurred by it in the administration of its duties hereunder
including, but not limited to, all counsel, advisors' and agents' fees and
disbursements and all taxes or other governmental charges.

  



  

(d) _Further Assurances_. From time to time on and after the date
hereof, Parent and the Stockholders' Agent shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent such further documents and instruments and shall
do or cause to be done such further acts as the Escrow Agent shall reasonably
request to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes of this
Escrow Agreement, to evidence compliance herewith or to assure itself that it
is protected in acting hereunder.

  



  

(e) _Resignation_. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time and be
discharged from its duties as escrow agent hereunder by its giving the other
parties hereto written notice, and such resignation shall become effective as
hereinafter provided. Such resignation shall become effective at such time
that the Escrow Agent shall turn over to a successor escrow agent appointed by
Parent and approved by the Stockholders' Agent, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Escrow Account held
hereunder. If no new escrow agent is so appointed within the sixty (60) day
period following the giving of such notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent
may deposit the Escrow Account with any court it reasonably deems appropriate
in the State of New York.

  



  

(f) _Discharge of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall resign and
be discharged from its duties as escrow agent hereunder if so requested in
writing at any time by the Parties, jointly; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such resignation shall become effective only upon acceptance of appointment
by a successor escrow agent as provided in _Section 7(e)_.

EXHIBIT K

  



  

 _LOCKUP AGREEMENT_

  



  

THIS LOCKUP AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
[_________], 2014, by and among MergeWorthRx Corp., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and the undersigned Company Stockholder ("Seller"). Each
capitalized term used, but not otherwise defined, herein has the respective
meaning ascribed to such term in the Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of October 14, 2014, by and among Parent, AeroCare
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and the other parties thereto (the
"Merger Agreement").

  



  

In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and agreed, Seller and Parent
hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1.   The execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to the performance of the parties\' obligations under the Merger Agreement, including the delivery of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Seller pursuant thereto (the "Shares").

  



  

2.   Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that during the Lockup Period (as defined below), as applicable to those Shares which remain subject to the Lockup Period from time to time (as set forth below), it shall not (A) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to any portion of such Shares, (B) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any such Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such Shares or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (C) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (A) or (B). As used herein, the term "Lockup Period" means the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of: (a) (i) with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the Shares, the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) with respect to the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Shares, the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date and (b) the date that Parent consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the holders of Parent Common Stock having the right to exchange their shares of Parent Common Stock for cash, securities or other property.

  



  

3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, above, each Seller may transfer any or all of its Shares:

  



  

(a) to the officers, directors or employees of Parent;

  



  

(b) if Seller is an entity, to any person which, directly or
indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with
such Seller, including, without limitation, any partner, officer, director or
member of such Seller and, with respect to any Seller that is a private
investment fund, to any person which is controlled by or under common control
with one or more general partners of such Seller;

  



  

(c) to Seller's immediate family members and trusts for estate
planning purposes;

  



  

(d) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon Seller's
death; or

  



  

(e) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order;

  



  

provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (a) through (e), such
permitted transferee(s) becomes bound by the transfer restrictions and
forfeiture provisions contained herein.

  



    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

4. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller hereby authorizes Parent during the Lockup Period to cause the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock to decline to transfer any Shares, and to place restrictive legends and note stop transfer restrictions on the Shares, the stock register and other records relating to the Shares.

  



  

5. Seller hereby represents and warrants to Parent that (i) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the undersigned, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

  



  

6. Parent hereby represents and warrants to Seller that the lock-up restrictions set forth herein are no more restrictive to Seller than those lock-up restrictions applicable to the Parent's Sponsors in that certain Stock Escrow Agreement dated as of June 26, 2013, by and among MEDWORTH ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation, Charles F. Fistel, Stephen B. Cichy, and Anthony Minnuto, John J. Delucca, Jeffrey A. Rein, Robert G. Savage and Howard I. Schwartz, M.D and CONTINENTAL STOCK TRANSFER and TRUST COMPANY, a New York corporation (the "Parent Lock-Up Restrictions").

2.   _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_.

  



  

2.1 _Resale Shelf Registration Rights_.

  



  

2.1.1 _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable
Securities_. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed with the Commission, no later than thirty (30) days following the date
of this Agreement, a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the
resale from time to time by Investors of all of the Registrable Securities
held by Investors and the Option Securities (the " _Resale Shelf Registration
Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3
or another appropriate form permitting Registration of such
Registrable Securities for resale by such Investors. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Resale Shelf Registration Statement to
be declared effective as soon as possible after filing, and once effective, to
keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the
Securities Act at all times until the expiration of the Effectiveness Period.

  



  

2.1.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company
shall notify the Investors in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number
of copies of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any
amendments, supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein
(including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and
supplements) and any documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement or such other documents as the Investors may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable
Securities in the manner described in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement.

  



  

2.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.1.1_ above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith (i)
as may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective
and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness
Period and (ii) to include the registration for resale from time to time by
Investors any Earn-Out Shares as soon as reasonably practicable following
issuance thereof.

  

  



    

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

  



  

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in
this _Section 2.1_ , in the event the Commission informs the Company that all
of the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule
415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to file
amendments to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the
Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and
file a new registration statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), in
either case covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities permitted to
be registered by the Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available to
register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering;
_provided, however_ , that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration
Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of
all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-
available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the
Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "), including without limitation, the
Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a
limitation of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be
registered on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering
(and notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with
the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable
Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its
Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered
on such Registration Statement will first be reduced by Registrable
Securities other than the Sponsors' Shares (applied on a pro rata basis based
on the total number of Registrable Securities held by such Investors, subject
to a determination by the Commission that certain Investors must be reduced
first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Investors)
and second by Registrable Securities represented by the Sponsors' Shares
(applied on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Sponsors' Shares
held by such Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that
certain Investors must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable
Securities held by such Investors). In the event the Company amends the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the
case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as
allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to
registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on
Form S-3 or such other form available to register for resale
those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New
Registration Statement.

  



  

2.1.5 _Notice of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly
notify the Investors in writing of any request by the Commission for any
amendment or supplement to, or additional information in connection with, the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement required to be prepared and filed
hereunder (or Prospectus relating thereto). The Company shall promptly notify
each Investor in writing of the filing of the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or any Prospectus, amendment or supplement related thereto or any
post-effective amendment to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and the
effectiveness of any post-effective amendment.

  



  

(a) If the Company shall receive a request from (x) the holders of
at least 2,000,000 shares of Registrable Securities, provided that the
estimated market value of the Registrable Securities is at least $20,000,000
(the requesting holder(s) shall be referred to herein as the " _Requesting
Holder_ ") that the Company effect the Underwritten Takedown of all or any
portion of the Requesting Holder's Registrable Securities, and specifying the
intended method of disposition thereof, then the Company shall promptly give
notice of such requested Underwritten Takedown (each such request shall be
referred to herein as a " _Demand Takedown_ ") at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the anticipated filing date of the prospectus or supplement
relating to such Demand Takedown to the other Holders and thereupon shall use
its reasonable best efforts to effect, as expeditiously as possible, the
offering in such Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested such
offering under _Section 2.1.5(a)_ , and

  

  



    

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2.4_ , all
other Registrable Securities that any holders of Registrable Securities (all
such holders, together with the Requesting Holder, the " _Selling Holders_ ")
have requested the Company to offer by request received by the Company within
seven Business Days after such holders receive the Company's notice of the
Demand Takedown, all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in
accordance with the intended methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable
Securities so to be offered.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the expiration of the seven-Business Day-period
referred to in _Section 2.1.5(a)(ii)_ , the Company will notify all Selling
Holders of the identities of the other Selling Holders and the number of
shares of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



  

(c) The Company shall only be required to effectuate one
Underwritten Takedown within any six-month period

  



  

(d) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises
the Company and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having
an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares
can be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be
reduced by the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on
a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by
such Investors, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Investors must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Investors).

  



  

2.1.6 _Selection of Underwriters_. Selling Holders holding a
majority in interest of the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in an
Underwritten Takedown shall have the right to select an Underwriter or
Underwriters in connection with such Underwritten Takedown, which Underwriter
or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In connection
with an Underwritten Takedown, the Company shall enter into customary
agreements (including an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take
such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Takedown, including, if necessary, the engagement of a "qualified independent
underwriter" in connection with the qualification of the underwriting
arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

  



  

2.1.7 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall
not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

  



    

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

  

  



  

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to
time with respect to the Sponsors' Shares and Working Capital Shares or three
months prior to the initial Release Date with respect to all other Registrable
Securities of the Original Investors, the holders of a majority-in-interest
of such Sponsors' Shares or other Registrable Securities, as the case may be,
may make a written demand for Registration under the Securities Act of all or
any portion of their Sponsors' Shares or other Registrable Securities on Form
S-1 or any similar long-form Registration or, if, then available, on Form S-3.
Each registration requested pursuant to this _Section 2.2.1_ is referred to
herein as a " _Demand Registration_ ". Any demand for a Demand Registration
shall specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will
notify all Original Investors that are holders of Registrable Securities of
the demand, and each such holder of Registrable Securities who wishes to
include all or a portion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the
Demand Registration (each such holder including shares of Registrable
Securities in such registration, a " _Demanding Holder_ ") shall so notify
the Company within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by the holder of the
notice from the Company. Upon any such request, the Demanding Holders shall
be entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand
Registration, subject to _Section 2.2.4_ and the provisos set forth in
_Section 3.1.1_. The Company shall not be obligated to effect more than an
aggregate of two (2) Demand Registrations under this _Section 2.2.1_ in
respect of all Registrable Securities.

  



  

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a
Demand Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to such Demand Registration has been declared
effective and the Company has complied with all of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such
Registration Statement has been declared effective, the offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by
any stop order or injunction of the Commission or any other governmental
agency or court, the Registration Statement with respect to such Demand
Registration will be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering; provided, further, that
the Company shall not be obligated to file a second Registration Statement
until a Registration Statement that has been filed is counted as a Demand
Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. If a majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders so elect and such holders so advise the Company as part of
their written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an underwritten offering. In such event, the right of any holder to
include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned
upon such holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of
such holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent
provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or
Underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority-in-interest of the
holders initiating the Demand Registration, and subject to the approval of
the Company.

  

  



    

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering
advises the Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar
amount or number of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding
Holders desire to sell, taken together with all other shares of Common Stock
or other securities which the Company desires to sell and the shares of
Common Stock, if any, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders
of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of shares that can be sold in such offering without adversely
affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method,
or the probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of shares, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Shares_ "),
then the Company shall include in such registration: (i) first,
the Registrable Securities as to which Demand Registration has been requested
by the Demanding Holders (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares
that each such Person has requested be included in such registration,
regardless of the number of shares held by each such Person (such proportion
is referred to herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (ii) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i),
the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires to
sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (iii)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the shares of Common Stock or other
securities registrable pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Option issued to
EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. or its designees in connection with the Company's
initial public offering (the " _Purchase Options_ " and such registrable
securities, the " _Option Securities_ ") and (iv) fourth, the shares of
Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with such persons, as to which "piggy-back" registration has been requested
by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to
include all of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-
in-interest of the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering
by giving written notice to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of
their request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration.
If the majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a
proposed offering relating to a Demand Registration, then either the Demanding
Holders shall reimburse the Company for the costs associated with the
withdrawn registration (in which case such registration shall not count as a
Demand Registration provided for in _Section 2.1_ ) or the withdrawn
registration shall count as a Demand Registration provided for in _Section
2.1_.

  



  

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an
offering of equity securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable
or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity securities, by the Company
for its own account or for shareholders of the Company for their account (or
by the Company and by shareholders of the Company including, without
limitation, pursuant to _Section 2.1_ ), other than a Registration Statement
(i) filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan,
(ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's
existing shareholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into
equity securities of the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan,
then the Company shall (x) give written notice of such proposed filing to the
holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less
than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall
describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering,
the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing
Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the
holders of Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register
the sale of such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such
holders may request in writing within five (5) days following receipt of such
notice (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ "). The Company shall cause such
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration and shall use its
best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed
underwritten offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in a Piggy-Back Registration on the same terms and conditions as any
similar securities of the Company and to permit the sale or other disposition
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to
distribute their securities through a Piggy-Back Registration that
involves an Underwriter or Underwriters shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for
such Piggy-Back Registration.

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten
offering advises the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in
writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock which the
Company desires to sell, taken together with shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which registration has been demanded pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder and the Registrable Securities as to which registration has been
requested under this _Section 2.3_ , exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares,
then the Company shall include in any such registration:

  



  

(a) If the registration is undertaken for the Company's account: (A)
first, the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company

to withdraw such holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in
any Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal
by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of

similar short-form registration which may be available at such time (" _Form
S-3_ "); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect
such request through an underwritten offering. Upon receipt of such written
request, the Company will promptly give written notice of the proposed
registration to all other holders of Registrable Securities, and, as soon as
practicable thereafter, effect the registration of all or such portion of such
holder's or Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together
with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities or other securities of
the Company, if any, of any other holder or holders joining in such request as
are specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such written notice from the Company; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration pursuant to
this _Section 2.3.4_ : (i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or

of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such
registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities
(if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than $500,000.
Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.3.4_ shall not be counted
as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

3.   _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

  



  

3.1 _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 2_
, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration
and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in
connection with any such request:

  



  

3.1.1 _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, as expeditiously as possible after receipt of a
request for a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , prepare and file
with the Commission a Registration Statement on any form for which the
Company then qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate
and which form shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities
to be registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective and use its reasonable best
efforts to keep it effective for the Effectiveness Period; provided, however,
that the Company shall have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up
to ninety (90) days, and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may be
applicable to deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-Back
Registration relates, in each case if the Company shall furnish to the
holders a certificate signed by the President or Chairman of the Company
stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
shareholders for such Registration Statement to be effected at such time;
provided further, however, that the Company shall not have the right to
exercise the right set forth in the immediately preceding proviso for more
than a total of ninety (90) days in any 365-day period in respect of a Demand
Registration hereunder.

  



  

3.1.2 _Copies_. The Company shall, prior to filing a Registration
Statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish
without charge to the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
registration, and such holders' legal counsel, copies of such Registration
Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such
Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such
other documents as the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
registration or legal counsel for any such holders may request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
holders.

  



  

3.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. The Company shall prepare and
file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective
amendments, and supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities
Act until all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such
securities have been withdrawn (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

3.1.4 _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration
Statement, the Company shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2)
business days after such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement of such filing, and shall
further notify such holders promptly and confirm such advice in writing in
all events within two (2) business days of the occurrence of any of the
following: (i) when such Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when
any post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement becomes
effective; (iii) the issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any
stop order (and the Company shall take all actions required to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by
the Commission for any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement
or any prospectus relating thereto or for additional information or of the
occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment
to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
including documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such
holders and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
such documents and comment thereon.

  



  

3.1.5 _State Securities Laws Compliance_. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or
"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may reasonably request and (ii) take
such action necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may
be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
paragraph or subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction.

  



  

3.1.6 _Agreements for Disposition_. The Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement
in customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities. The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company in
any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any
Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the
benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
registration statement, and the representations, warranties and covenants of
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration statement
in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any
Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the

such offering and all other offering materials and related documents, and
participation in meetings with Underwriters, attorneys, accountants and
potential investors.

Company shall make available for inspection by the holders of Registrable

participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement and
any attorney, accountant or other professional retained by any holder of

Underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of the Company, as shall be necessary to enable them to
exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause the Company's officers,

158 thereunder.

  



  

3.1.10 _Listing_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause all Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement

3.2 _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any
notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described
in  _Section 3.1.4(iv)_ , or, upon any suspension by the Company, pursuant to
a written insider trading compliance program adopted by the Company's Board
of Directors, of the ability of all "insiders" covered by such program to
transact in the Company's securities because of the existence of material
non-public information, each holder of Registrable Securities included in any
registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such Registrable
Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by  _Section 3.1.4(iv)_ or the restriction on the ability of
"insiders" to transact in the Company's securities is removed, as applicable,
and, if so directed by the Company, each such holder will deliver to the
Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's
possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

Securities included in such registration. The Company shall have no obligation
to pay any underwriting discounts or selling commissions attributable to the
Registrable Securities being sold by the holders thereof, which underwriting
discounts or selling commissions shall be borne by such holders.
Additionally, in an underwritten offering, all selling shareholders and the
Company shall bear the expenses of the Underwriter pro rata in proportion to
the respective amount of shares each is selling in such offering.

  



  

3.4 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall
promptly provide such information as may reasonably be requested by the
Company, or the managing Underwriter, if any, in connection with the
preparation of any Registration Statement, including amendments and

4.   INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable
Securities, and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates,
directors, partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any,
who controls an Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) (each, an " _Investor Indemnified Party_ "), from and against
any expenses, losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether
joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or
allegedly untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered
under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment
or supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon
any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Investor Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending
any such expense, loss, judgment, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
the Company, in writing, by such selling holder expressly for use therein, or
is based on any selling holder's violation of the federal securities laws
(including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable Securities in
accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the prospectus.

  

  



    

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

  



  

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
selling holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any
registration is being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such selling
holder, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and
officers, and each other selling holder and each other person, if any, who
controls another selling holder within the meaning of the Securities Act,
against any losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities, whether joint
or several, insofar as such losses, claims, judgments, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable
Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to
the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or
the alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, if the statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use
therein, or is based on any selling holder's violation of the federal
securities laws (including Regulation M) or failure to sell the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the plan of distribution contained in the
prospectus, and shall reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and
each other selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling
holder's indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint
and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by
such selling holder.

  



  

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after
receipt by any person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or
liability or any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant
to _Sections 4.1_ or 4.2, such person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other person for
indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment, damage, liability or
action; provided, however, that the failure by the Indemnified Party to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to such Indemnified Party
hereunder, except and solely to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought against the
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided,
however, that in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel (but no more than one such separate
counsel, which counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) to
represent the Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be
subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity
may be sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with
the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party
if, based upon the written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party,
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party
shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
entry of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could
have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Party, unless such judgment or settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim or proceeding.

4.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in
respect of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein,
then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or
omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of any
Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnifying Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



  

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.4.2_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding _Section 4.4.1_.

  



  

4.4.3 The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 4.4_ , no
holder of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any
underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or taxes) actually received by
such holder from the sale of Registrable Securities which gave rise to such
contribution obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

5.   _UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION_.

  



  

5.1 _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and shall take such further action as the holders of Registrable
Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such holders to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended
from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
Commission.

  



  

6.   _MISCELLANEOUS_.

  



  

6.1 _Other Registration Rights_. Except with respect to the
securities issued or issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Options, the
Company represents and warrants that no person, other than a holder of the
Registrable Securities, has any right to require the Company to register any
shares of the Company's capital stock for sale or to include shares of the
Company's capital stock in any registration filed by the Company for the sale
of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the account of
any other person.

  



  

6.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be
assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable
Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any permitted transfer of
Registrable Securities by any such holder. This Agreement and the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and the holders of
Registrable Securities and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any
persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in
_Section 4_ and this _Section 6.2_. The rights of a holder of Registrable
Securities under this Agreement may be transferred by such a holder to a
transferee who acquires or holds Registrable Securities equal to at least
five percent (5%) of the Registrable Securities held by the holders of
Registrable Securities on the date hereof; provided, however, that such
transferee has executed and delivered to the Company a properly completed
agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement substantially in form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_  (an " _Addendum Agreement_ "), and the
transferor shall have delivered to the Company no later than thirty (30) days
following the date of the transfer, written notification of such transfer
setting forth the name of the transferor, the name and address of the
transferee, and the number of Registrable Securities so transferred. The
execution of an Addendum Agreement shall constitute a permitted amendment of
this Agreement.
