B.C. Ltd., a company incorporated under the _Business Corporations Act_
(British Columbia) (" _Exchangeco_ "), and Corry Flatt, in his capacity as

11.16_. All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in _Article 10_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in
this Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Each of the
Company, GTY, Callco, Exchangeco and, upon its incorporation and its addition
as a party to this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.4_ , Holdings may also be
referred to individually herein as a " _Party_ ," and collectively as the "
_Parties_."

  



  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

  



  

A. GTY is a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of
effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more
businesses.

  



  

B. Prior to the date of the filing of the Interim Order, GTY will
incorporate in the State of Massachusetts a wholly-owned, direct
subsidiary of GTY (" _Holdings_ "), for the purpose of consummating the
Transaction and the Roll-Up Transactions, and the parties hereto have agreed
that it is desirable to utilize Holdings to effectuate the Transaction and for
Holdings to file the Registration Statement (as defined herein).

  



  

C. Prior to the Effective Time, a newly formed wholly-owned
subsidiary of Holdings (" _GTY Merger Sub_ ") will merge with and into GTY
with GTY continuing as the surviving entity upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in an agreement and plan of merger by and among
Holdings, GTY and GTY Merger Sub (the " _GTY Merger_ ").

  



  

D. After the GTY Merger and prior to the Effective Time, GTY will
assign to Holdings all of GTY's rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement and all agreements in connection with the Roll-Up Transactions.

  



  

E. GTY Merger Sub is a newly formed, wholly-owned Subsidiary of
GTY, and was formed for the sole purpose of the Transaction.

H. The Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
the research, design, development, implementation, customization,

I.   Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Persons listed in
Section 2.3(a) of the Company's Disclosure Schedule (together with the
holders of the vested Bonfire Options and the Bonfire Warrant, the " _Bonfire
Holders_ ") will own all of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock
of the Company, which consists of Common Shares and Preferred Shares,
issuable in series, the first series of which has been designated Series Seed
I Preferred Shares, the second series of which has been designated Series Seed
II Preferred Shares, the third series of which has been designated Series
Seed III Preferred Shares, the fourth series of which has been designated
Series Seed IV Preferred Shares and the fifth series of which has been
designated Series A Preferred Shares (collectively, the  " _Bonfire Shares_
").

  



  

J. The Company, GTY, Callco and Exchangeco wish to propose a
statutory plan of arrangement under the OBCA on substantially the terms
and conditions set forth in the Plan of Arrangement attached as _Exhibit A_
involving, among other things, the acquisition by Callco and Exchangeco of all
of the issued and outstanding Bonfire Shares in exchange for cash and, at the
election of Bonfire Holders, shares of GTY Common Stock or Exchangeable
Shares.

  



  

K. The Bonfire Board has unanimously determined that the Arrangement
is in the best interests of the Company and recommends that the
Bonfire Holders vote in favor of the Arrangement Resolution.

  



  

L. Certain Bonfire Holders, the Company and the GTY Parties have
entered into voting and support agreements substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (" _Voting and Support Agreements_ "),
pursuant to which, among other things, the particular Bonfire Holders have
agreed to vote all of the Bonfire Shares held by them in favor of the
Arrangement Resolution at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

  



  

M. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
Voting and Support Agreements from the remaining Bonfire Holders and the
holders of the Bonfire Options and Bonfire Warrants, in which case the
parties hereto shall consider in good faith, and if acceptable shall make and
approve, such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in
order to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein by way of share
purchase transactions without the requirement on the part of the parties
hereto to complete the Arrangement, all in accordance with _Section 1.13_  of
this Agreement.

  



  

N. The Bonfire Holders acknowledge that it is in the best interests
of all of the holders of GTY Common Stock to reasonably cooperate in good
faith with GTY in connection with the orderly sale and disposition of the GTY
Common Stock in the future in a manner that maximizes value for all holders
of GTY Common Stock, and certain of the Bonfire Holders have agreed to enter
into certain covenants relating thereto contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other valuable consideration herein contained, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE 1 

  



  

PURCHASE AND SALE

  



  

1.1 _Plan of Arrangement_.

  



  

(a) _Arrangement. _ On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the OBCA,
the Parties agree to carry out the Arrangement and to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable
following the Proxy Statement Filing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Article 1 and in any event after the date that all steps comprising the Pre-
Closing Reorganization have been consummated and before the Termination Date.
On the Closing Date, the Articles of Arrangement (" _Articles of Arrangement_
"), the Final Order and such other documents as may be required to give
effect to the Arrangement will be filed with the Director who will then issue
the Certificate of Arrangement. The Certificate of Arrangement will be
conclusive evidence that the Arrangement has become effective on, and be
binding on and after, the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Interim Order_. The Company agrees that as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any event prior to 5
Business Days following the Proxy Statement Filing Date, it will, in a manner
reasonably acceptable to the GTY Parties, pursuant to Section 182(5) of the
OBCA and, in cooperation with the GTY Parties, prepare, file and diligently
pursue an application for the Interim Order, which will provide, among other
things:

  



  

(i) for the calling and holding of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
including confirming the record date for determining the classes of Persons
to whom notice is to be provided in respect of the Arrangement and the Company
Shareholder Meeting and for the manner in which such notice is to be
provided;

  



  

(ii) that, subject to the approval of the Court, the requisite
approval for the Arrangement Resolution by the Bonfire Holders will be 66
2/3% or more of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by the Bonfire
Holders present in person or represented by proxy at the Company Shareholder
Meeting, voting together as a single class;

  



  

(iii) for the notice requirements with respect to the presentation of
the application to the Court for a Final Order;

  



  

(iv) that the Company Shareholder Meeting may be adjourned or
postponed from time to time by the Company with the consent of the GTY
Parties without the need for further approval from the Court;

  



  

(v) confirmation of the record date for the purposes of determining
the Bonfire Holders entitled to receive material and vote at the Company
Shareholder Meeting; and

  



  

(vi) for such other matters as the GTY Parties may reasonably require,
subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Company, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



    

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Company Shareholder Meeting_. The Company shall use its best
efforts to take all such steps as are necessary to set the record date for
the Company Shareholder Meeting as a date not later than the date the Interim
Order is obtained in accordance with _(b)_  above and subject to the terms of
this Agreement and in accordance with and compliance with the Interim Order,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 35 days after the
Proxy Statement Filing Date or such later date as may be required in order
to provide Bonfire Holders with additional disclosure as required in
connection with the SEC review of the Proxy Statement) convene and hold the
Company Shareholder Meeting in accordance with the Interim Order and
applicable Law for the purpose of considering the Arrangement Resolution and,
unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with Article
9, the Company will not cancel the Company Shareholder Meeting or fail to put
the Arrangement Resolution before the Bonfire Holders for their
consideration without the GTY Parties' prior written consent, other than as
may be required under the Interim Order or applicable Law. The Company will
diligently do all such acts and things as may be necessary to comply with
applicable Laws (including securities Laws and the articles of the Company)
in relation to the Company Shareholder Meeting. Subject to the GTY Parties
complying with all applicable Laws, the GTY Parties may at any time, directly
or through a soliciting dealer, actively solicit proxies in favor of the
Arrangement Resolution.

  



  

(d) _Information Circular_.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company will prepare the Circular, together with any
other documents required by applicable Laws in connection with the
Arrangement, and in consultation with the GTY Parties. In the context of
preparing the Circular, the Company will consider in good faith any comments
provided by GTY. As promptly as practicable after the receipt of the Interim
Order (and in any event by no later than one (1) day thereafter), the Company
will deliver the final Circular to the GTY Parties. The GTY Parties shall
have the right to review and approve any changes to the Circular made in
connection with the Interim Order. As soon as practicable after the GTY
Parties' approval of the Circular (and in any event no later than one (1)
Business Day thereafter), the Company shall cause the Circular and all other
documentation required in connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting to
be sent to each of the Bonfire Holders and be filed as required by the
Interim Order and applicable Law.

  



  

(ii) The Company will ensure that the Circular complies with all
applicable Laws including securities Laws and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, that the Circular does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made (other than
with respect to any information relating to and provided by the GTY Parties or
any third party that is not an Affiliate of the Company). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company will ensure that the
Circular: (i) provides Bonfire Holders entitled to vote with information in
sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the
matters to be placed before them at the Company Shareholder Meeting and the
GTY Parties will provide all information they reasonably believe is required
of them in order for the Company to do so, at the Company's request, (ii)
includes a statement that the Bonfire Board has unanimously determined that
the Arrangement is in the best interests of the Company and recommends that
the Bonfire Holders vote in favor of the Arrangement Resolution and (iii)
includes a statement that each director and senior officer of the Company
intends to vote all of his or her Bonfire Shares in favor of the Arrangement
Resolution and against any resolution submitted by any Bonfire Holder that is
inconsistent with the Arrangement.

  



    

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Final Order_. The Company shall take all steps necessary or
desirable to submit the Arrangement to the Court and diligently pursue an
application for the Final Order pursuant to Section 182(5) of the OBCA as soon
as reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than three (3) Business
Days after the Arrangement Resolution is approved at the Company Shareholders
Meeting as provided for in the Interim Order.

  



  

(f) _Preparation of Filings_. The Company shall:

  



  

(i) prepare any application for the orders, rulings and consents and
any other documents reasonably deemed by the GTY Parties or the Company to be
necessary to discharge their respective obligations under applicable
securities and corporate Laws in connection with the Arrangement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby including, if applicable, the draft
Circular including the draft Interim Order and Articles of Arrangement that
are required by the OBCA to be sent to the Director appointed pursuant to
Section 278 of the OBCA in order for the Arrangement to be effective; and

  



  

(ii) take all such action as may be required under the OBCA in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement, and the GTY Parties will cooperate with the Company in
completion of the above.

  



  

(g) _Information for Filings, etc._ Each of the GTY Parties and the
Company will furnish to the other all such information concerning it and its
shareholders as may be reasonably required (and, in the case of its
shareholders, available to it) for the completion of the actions described in
this _Section 1.1_ , and each covenants that no information furnished by it
(to its knowledge in the case of information concerning its shareholders) in
connection with such actions or otherwise in connection with the consummation
of the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in any such document or necessary in order
to make any information so furnished for use in any such document not
misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it is furnished.

  



  

(h) _Changes in Information._ The GTY Parties and the Company will
each promptly notify the other if at any time before or after the
Effective Time it becomes aware that the Circular or an application for an
order or a consent described in _Section 1.1_ contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances in which they are made, or that otherwise
requires an amendment or supplement to the Circular or such application or
consent. In any such event, the GTY Parties and the Company will cooperate in
the preparation of a supplement or amendment to the Circular or such other
document, as required and as the case may be, and, if required, will cause
the same to be distributed to the Bonfire Holders and filed, as required with
the relevant securities regulatory authorities.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.2 _Individual Arrangement Consideration_. The consideration
payable to each Bonfire Holder by the GTY Parties for all of the
Bonfire Shares held (or deemed to be held) by it at the Effective Time shall
be the Individual Arrangement Consideration, comprised as follows:

  



  

(a) at the election of such Bonfire Holder in accordance with the
Plan of Arrangement, the Pro Rata Portion of the Arrangement Shares (less the
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Shares) in the form of either (i) shares of GTY
Common Stock or (ii) the Exchangeable Shares, provided that in the event that
a Bonfire Holder does not at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date provide GTY with satisfactory evidence, acting reasonably, that such
Bonfire Holder satisfies the Investment Requirements, such Bonfire Holder
shall receive in lieu of the Arrangement Shares to which it would otherwise be
entitled under this _Section 1.2(a)_  (such Arrangement Shares, " _Cash-out
Shares_ "), a cash payment equal to the GTY Share Price multiplied by
the number of Arrangement Shares otherwise issuable to such Bonfire Holder
under this _Section 1.2(a)_ ;

  



  

(b) the Pro Rata Portion of the Cash Consideration;

  



  

(c) the right to receive the Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Shares
and Cash Escrow Amount, if any, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
provided that in the event that a Bonfire Holder does not at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date provide GTY with
satisfactory evidence, acting reasonably, that such Bonfire Holder satisfies
the Investment Requirements, such Bonfire Holder shall receive in lieu of the
Escrow Shares to which it would otherwise be entitled under this _Section
1.2(c),_ a cash payment equal to the amount the Escrow Agent is able to sell
such Escrow Shares for in open-market transactions (provided such Escrow
Shares, if Exchangeable Shares, have been exchanged for shares of GTY Common
Stock), less any brokerage fees or other transaction costs
reasonably incurred in connection therewith;

  



  

  

(d) the right to receive the Pro Rata Portion of any amounts payable
to the Bonfire Holders out of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount;

  



  

(e) the right to receive the Pro Rata Portion of an amount, if any,
equal to the Earnout Payment; and

  



  

(f) the right to receive the Pro Rata Portion of any funds payable
to the Bonfire Holders out of the Representative Expense Fund in
accordance with _Section 11.16(f)_.

  

    

  



  

For certainty, there is no assurance that the Bonfire Holders will be
entitled to receive any of the distributions or payments contemplated in the
foregoing subsections _(c)_ , _(d)_ and  _(e)_. Each Bonfire Holder shall be
required to execute and deliver to the Exchange Agent a Letter of Transmittal
prior to receipt of his, her or its Individual Arrangement Consideration.

  



  

1.3 _Payment and Delivery of Aggregate Arrangement Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Subject to any withholding pursuant to _Section 1.8_ , the GTY
Parties shall pay the aggregate Individual Arrangement Consideration payable
to all Bonfire Holders as follows:

  



    

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) by depositing, or causing to be deposited, prior to the
Effective Time with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or such other
bank or trust company that may be designated by the GTY Parties and be
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the Bonfire Holders, for exchange in accordance with this _Section
1.3_ and the Plan of Arrangement through the Exchange Agent, sufficient
funds, shares of GTY Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares in an
aggregate amount necessary for the payment of the Cash Consideration (less
the Closing Option Amount) and the Arrangement Shares (less the Escrow
Shares);

  



  

(ii) by depositing prior to the Effective Time the Escrow Shares and
the Cash Escrow Amount into the Indemnity Escrow Account, which Escrow Shares
and Cash Escrow Amount shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account in

(iii) by depositing prior to the Effective Time $100,000 in cash (the

_Arrangement Consideration_ ". The funds and shares provided to the Exchange
Agent are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Arrangement Consideration

applicable provincial Tax statute with respect to the sale of Bonfire Shares
sold by such holder. Each party shall bear their respective fees and expenses
relating to the making of such election in accordance with _Section 11.1_
of this Agreement, it being understood that each such holder shall in a
timely fashion, and at the sole cost and expense of the Company (and with
such cost and expense to be estimated and accrued in the Estimated Closing
Date Working Capital), prepare and provide Exchangeco with two signed copies
of the appropriate election forms duly completed. Each such joint election
shall specify an elected amount in respect of such Bonfire Shares to be
determined by the relevant holder, subject to the limitations set forth in the
Tax Act and the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial Tax
statute. Exchangeco shall sign any such joint election within a period of ten
(10) Business Days from the date of its receipt from the applicable Bonfire

1.5 _Closing Date Statement_. No later than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, the Bonfire Holders' Representative shall deliver to
the GTY Parties a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth
or attaching, as applicable:

  



  

(a) the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Date Working
Capital (" _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ "), and either (i) the
amount, if any, by which such estimate exceeds Target Working Capital (any
such amount, an " _Estimated Working Capital Excess_ ") or (ii) the amount,
if any, by which such estimate is less than Target Working Capital (any such
amount, an " _Estimated Working Capital Deficit_ ");

  



  

(b) the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Date Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ ") and Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount_ "); and

  



  

(c) the resulting calculation of the Cash Consideration.

  



  

1.6 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination._

  



  

(a) After Closing, GTY shall prepare and, within ninety (90) days
after Closing, GTY shall deliver to the Bonfire Holders' Representative, a
statement (together with reasonable supporting documentation) setting forth
GTY's determination of (i) Closing Date Working Capital, (ii) Closing Date
Cash, and (iii) Closing Date Indebtedness (the " _Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement_ ").

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Company shall permit the Bonfire
Holders' Representative and its counsel, accountants and other
advisors reasonable access (during normal business hours, with the right to
make copies) to the financial and other relevant books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case for the purposes of the review and
objection right and dispute process contemplated in this _Section 1.6_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.6(b)_ , the
Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, grant access to or furnish information to the Bonfire
Holders' Representative to the extent that, in each case on the advice of its
outside counsel (i) such information is subject to an attorney/client or
attorney work product privilege or (ii) such access or the furnishing of such
information is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case GTY shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the requested information in
such alternative manner as may be reasonably required for the purposes of the
review and objection right and dispute process contemplated in this _Section
1.6_.

  



  

(c) If the Bonfire Holders' Representative disagrees with the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, the Bonfire Holders'
Representative shall notify GTY in writing of such disagreement within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, which
notice (subject to GTY's compliance with its obligations set forth in _Section
1.6(b)_ above) shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of such
disagreement, including the specific items involved and the dollar amounts
thereof (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ "). Any component of GTY's
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement that is not the subject of an objection
by the Bonfire Holders' Representative shall be final and binding on the
Parties and deemed to be part of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. If the Bonfire Holders' Representative does not deliver a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period, the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, as delivered by GTY to the Bonfire Holders' Representative, shall
be the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement_ ". If the Bonfire
Holders' Representative does deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice within
such 30-day period (the aggregate amount in dispute as set forth in the
Purchase Price Dispute Notice, the " _Disputed Amounts_ "), then the Disputed
Amounts shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_.

  



    

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) GTY and the Bonfire Holders' Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Amounts and, if the Parties are able to
resolve all Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as
modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the " _Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement_ ". If GTY and the Bonfire Holders' Representative
are unable to resolve all Disputed Amounts within twenty (20) days after
delivery of the Bonfire Holders' Representative's Purchase Price Dispute
Notice, then the Disputed Amounts shall be referred for final determination to
a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants, which does not have any material relationship with GTY,
the Bonfire Holders' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates
(such firm, or any successor thereto, the " _Accounting Expert_ ") within
fifteen (15) days after the end of such 20-day period. If GTY and the Bonfire
Holders' Representative are unable to agree upon an Accounting Expert within
such 15-day period, then the Accounting Expert shall be an accounting firm of
national standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New
York, New York which does not have any material relationship with GTY, the
Bonfire Holders' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates. The
Bonfire Holders' Representative and GTY shall execute any agreement
reasonably required by the Accounting Expert for its engagement hereunder.
The Accounting Expert shall consider only those Disputed Amounts which GTY
and the Bonfire Holders' Representative have been unable to resolve. The
Accounting Expert will act as an expert (not an arbitrator) and may select as
a resolution the position of either GTY or the Bonfire Holders'
Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any
independent review) or may impose an alternative resolution which cannot be
higher than the highest value or lower than the lowest value presented by each
Party for a disputed amount. The Accounting Expert shall deliver to GTY and
the Bonfire Holders' Representative, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within forty-five (45) days after its appointment, a written report
setting forth the resolution of such Disputed Amounts. Such report shall be
final and binding upon the Parties. In selecting such resolution, the
Accounting Expert shall rely solely on the terms of this Agreement and on
written submissions and supporting material provided by GTY and the Bonfire
Holders' Representative, and at the Accounting Expert's election, pursuant to
responses provided by the GTY and the Bonfire Holders' Representative to
inquiries posed by the Accounting Expert's review of the foregoing, but not
pursuant to an independent review. Upon the decision of the Accounting
Expert, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent
necessary to reflect the Accounting Expert's decision (and as otherwise
adjusted in accordance with this _Section 1.6_ ), shall be the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Expert shall be allocated to and borne by GTY and the Bonfire
Holders' Representative based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accounting Expert's determination (before such allocation) bears to the
Disputed Amount as originally submitted to the Accounting Expert. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting
Expert awards $600 in favor of the Bonfire Holders'
Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
GTY and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Bonfire
Holders' Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
resolution of any Disputed Amount or any facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to any such Disputed Amount, whether by the Accounting Expert
otherwise, shall limit the right of any party to assert and prevail on a
claim for a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder pursuant to
_Article 8_ (and subject to the limitations set forth therein).

  



    

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) " _Final Cash Consideration_ " means an amount equal to: (i) the
Cash Purchase Price, _less_ (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness amount as set
forth in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, _less_ (iii) the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount, _less_ (iv) the Cash Escrow Amount, _less_ (v)
the Representative Expense Fund, _plus_ (vi) the amount of any Working
Capital Excess as set forth in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement,
_less_ (vii) the amount of any Working Capital Deficit as set forth in the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, _plus_ (viii) the Closing Date
Cash as set forth in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (in each
case, terms used in this paragraph which are not defined in this Agreement
shall have the same meaning as those same terms that are defined by reference
to "Estimated", except as finally determined).

  



  

1.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount._

  



  

(a) The  " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Final Cash Consideration, minus (ii)
Cash Consideration.

  



  

(b) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number or zero, then:

  



  

(i) GTY and the Bonfire Holders' Representative shall provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account all of the funds contained therein to the
Bonfire Holders' Representative for the benefit of the Bonfire Holders; and

  



  

(ii) GTY shall promptly pay to the Bonfire Holders' Representative
the balance of the Adjustment Amount, if any, for the benefit of the Bonfire
Holders.

  



  

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then GTY and the
Bonfire Holders' Representative shall provide joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account
all of the funds contained therein as follows:

  



  

(i) to GTY, an amount equal to the lesser of: (x) the balance of the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, or (y) the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount;

  



  

(ii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the
balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, to the Bonfire
Holders' Representative the remainder of the Purchase Price Escrow Account,
for the benefit of the Bonfire Holders; and

  



  

(iii) to the extent that the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
exceeds the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, GTY shall be
entitled to recover such excess adjustment amount, at its option in its sole
discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Account or directly from the Bonfire
Holders, subject to the limitations set forth in _Article 8_ hereof.

  



    

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 1.7_ shall be paid
(or joint instruction to the Escrow Agent shall be provided) within two (2)
Business Days after final determination pursuant to _Section 1.6_ of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Party receiving such payment.

  



  

(e) The Bonfire Holders and the GTY Parties agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.7_ as an adjustment to the purchase
price for federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

  



  

1.8 _Withholding_. Subject to _Section 1.14_ of this Agreement, the
GTY Parties, the Company, the Exchange Agent and their Affiliates shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, the Tax
Act, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any
other applicable legal requirement. For greater certainty, the number of
shares of GTY Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares, or any shares forming part
of the Earnout Payment, as the case may be, shall not be reduced to
satisfy any such withholding obligation. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. The GTY Parties shall provide the Bonfire Holders'
Representative with at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of
any withholding proposed to be made by the GTY Parties in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this _Section 1.8_.

  



  

1.9 _Closing_. The consummation of the Transaction (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP in New York, New
York, or remotely via electronic exchange of documents and signatures,
commencing at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the second (2nd) Business Day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the Parties to
consummate the Transaction (other than conditions with respect to actions the
respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such other date as GTY
and Bonfire Holders' representative may mutually agree in writing (the "
_Closing Date_ ").

  



  

1.10 _Earnout Payment_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
_Exhibit B_ , after the Closing, the applicable GTY Parties shall pay to the
Bonfire Holders the Earnout Payment as additional consideration pursuant to
and in accordance with _Exhibit B_.

  



  

1.11 _Convertible Securities_.

  



  

(a) Under the Plan of Arrangement:

  



  

  

(i) all vested Bonfire Options will, immediately prior to Closing, be
surrendered for cancellation and the holders thereof will receive, subject to
any Tax withholding remitting obligations of the Company, for each Bonfire
Option, an amount equal to their Individual Arrangement Consideration, which
shall be calculated based upon a number of Bonfire Shares equal to (A) the In-
the-money-amount of such Bonfire Option, divided by (B) the Closing Value of
a Bonfire Share, and each holder of Bonfire Options shall receive under the
Plan of Arrangement the Individual Arrangement Consideration as if it were a
Bonfire Holder with respect to such In-the-money-amount;

  



    

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) all unvested Bonfire Options will be surrendered for
cancellation and the holders thereof will receive, subject to any Tax
withholding remitting obligations of the Company, stock options under the GTY
Equity Incentive Plan (" _Assumed Option(s)_ ") in accordance with the Plan
of Arrangement; provided that the Assumed Options shall represent, in the
aggregate, no greater than 1,200,000 shares of GTY Common Stock;

  



  

(iii) each such Bonfire Option shall be cancelled and terminated and
the holder thereof shall thereafter only have the right to receive
the foregoing consideration and the Bonfire Stock Option Plan will be
terminated and be of no further force and effect; provided that the payment
of the Cash Consideration portion of the Individual Arrangement Consideration
(the aggregate amount of all such Individual Arrangement Consideration, the "
_Closing Option Amount_ ") payable to any Bonfire Holder with respect to his
or her Bonfire Option shall be transferred to the Company for further
payment, as soon as practicable (but in no event later than the second
regular payroll date after the Effective Time), to such Bonfire Holders of
such Individual Arrangement Consideration through the Company's payroll
processing system or other appropriate account net of applicable Tax
withholding;

  



  

  

(iv) the Bonfire Warrants will be surrendered for cancellation in
exchange, subject to any Tax withholding remitting obligations of
the Company, for an amount equal to the Individual Arrangement Consideration,
which shall be calculated based upon a number of Bonfire Shares equal to (A)
the In-the-money-amount of such Bonfire Warrant, divided by (B) the Closing
Value of a Bonfire Share and the holder thereof shall thereafter only have
the right to receive the foregoing consideration and the certificate
representing the Bonfire Warrant will be terminated and be of no further
force and effect;

  



  

(v) for greater certainty, the obligation of the Company to pay the
consideration referred to in this _Section 1.11_ will not be considered a
liability of the Company for the purposes of determining the Closing Date
Working Capital, the Transaction Expenses, or the Closing Date Indebtedness;

  



  

(vi) each stock option granted under the GTY Equity Incentive Plan in
respect of any unvested Bonfire Option shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same vesting terms as those set forth in the Bonfire Stock Option Plan
and the option agreements relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, except that (A) such Assumed Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of GTY Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of Bonfire Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such unvested Bonfire
Option immediately prior to the Closing multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of GTY Common
Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of GTY Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the exercise price per Bonfire Share at which such
Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Closing by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; _provided, however,_
that each such Assumed Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject
to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to GTY
Common Stock prior to or subsequent to the Closing; and

  



    

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(vii) notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall have the right in its sole discretion and/or otherwise in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonfire Options to accelerate
the vesting of all or any portion of the unvested Bonfire Options prior to
the Closing.

  



  

1.12 _Arrangement Binding on Bonfire Holders_. For greater certainty:

  



  

(a) this Agreement is intended to constitute a purchase and sale
agreement relating to the Bonfire Shares, the terms and conditions of
which shall include the provisions of the Plan of Arrangement;

  



  

(b) subject to the Plan of Arrangement taking effect, the execution
of this Agreement by the Bonfire Holders' Representative will be deemed to be
and to have always been an execution of such purchase and sale agreement
described in clause (a) on behalf of each Bonfire Holder; and

  



  

(c) subject to the Plan of Arrangement taking effect, each such
Bonfire Holder will be deemed to be and to have always been a party to
such purchase and sale agreement described in clause (a) effective on and
after the date of this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the
forgoing, each such Bonfire Holder shall be bound by the provisions of this
_Section 1.12_ and _Section 11.16_ and _Article 8_ of this Agreement.

  



  

1.13 _Share Purchase Agreement_. The Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain executed and delivered Voting and
Support Agreements from all of the remaining Bonfire Holders, the remaining
holders of Bonfire Options and the remaining holders of Bonfire Warrants on
or before a date not later than September 15, 2018, in which case the parties
hereto shall consider in good faith, and if acceptable in their respective
sole discretion shall make and approve, such amendments to this Agreement as
may be reasonably required in order to give effect to the transactions
contemplated herein by way of share purchase transactions without the
requirement on the part of the parties hereto to complete the Arrangement
contemplated by _Section 1.1_ of this Agreement.

  



  

1.14 _Section 110(1.1) of the Tax Act; Tax Slips_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree that it is
their mutual intention to waive any entitlement to a deduction for Canadian
Tax purposes in respect of the payment of the Individual Arrangement
Consideration to be paid on account of the Bonfire Shares or Bonfire Options
pursuant to Section 1.2 or Section 1.11, in accordance with subsection
110(1.1) of the Tax Act and undertake to prepare tax slips for the employees
on such basis. Tax slips prepared for Canadian resident employees will, to
the extent available, reflect the deduction pursuant to paragraph 110(1)(d)
of the Tax Act.

business or the ownership of its properties or assets requires such license
or qualification, in each case, except where the failure to be so organized

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

and each Ancillary Agreement shall constitute the valid and legally binding
obligation of each Company Party that is a party hereto and thereto,
enforceable against such Company Party in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors generally and by

8.3 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) If a GTY Indemnitee or a Bonfire Holder Indemnitee (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") intends to make a claim for Losses under this _Article
8_ , then the Indemnified Party shall give the party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") written notice (a " _Breach Notice_ ") of such Indemnifiable Matter
which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of such
determination, setting forth (i) a brief description of the nature of
the Indemnifiable Matter, (ii) the underlying representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached and the facts then known
as it relates to the Indemnifiable Matter, (iii) the total amount of the
actual out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated Loss (including any costs or
expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith), if known and quantifiable, and (iv) a copy of all material
written evidence of Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
its obligations under this _Article 8_ , except to the extent that
such failure shall have materially adversely affected the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its or the Indemnified Party's
liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Breach Notice to dispute the contents of the Breach Notice. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party to investigate the matter
or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Indemnifiable Matter, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Indemnifiable Matter and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying

reasonable access to the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel during
normal business hours, with advance written notice, and in such a manner so
as not to interfere with the normal operations of such Indemnified Party, and
the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records (not subject
to any privilege)) as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to resolve the
disputes to the Breach Notice, if any, within thirty (30) days of the
Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Breach Notice, the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of any Proceeding with
respect to an Indemnifiable Matter which may give rise to a claim for Losses
under this _Article 8_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim setting forth (i) a brief
description of the nature of the Indemnifiable Matter, (ii) the underlying
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached
and the facts then known as it relates to the Indemnifiable Matter, (iii) the

(including any costs or expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred
in connection therewith), if known and quantifiable, and (iv) a copy of any
correspondence or notice received from the relevant third party and all
material written evidence of the Loss; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article 8_ , except to the
extent that such failure shall have materially adversely affected the ability
of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its or the Indemnified
Party's liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
option, by written notice given to the Indemnified Party not later than
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Breach Notice, to assume the entire
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim,
and shall be entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel to be the
lead counsel in connection with such defense that is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim:

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently and in good faith defend
such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of the status of such defense;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information and
documents related to such Third Party Claim; and

  



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party (A) may participate in such defense and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.3_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or conduct the defense of
any Third-Party Claim (without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, in its sole discretion) if (i) such Third-Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal action, subpoena, criminal
investigative demand, criminal investigation or criminal proceeding of a
Governmental Body, (ii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith such Third-Party Claim, (iv)
the assumption of the defense of the Third-Party Claim would, in the good
faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, give rise to conflicts of interest,
(v) the assumption of the defense of the Third-Party Claim would have, in the
good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, a material adverse effect on
the business relationship between the Indemnified Party and any Persons with
whom it has material business dealings, (vi) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Third-Party Claim is, in the good faith judgment
of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or
practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified
Party, (vii) the Indemnifying Party's counsel is not reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, or (viii) the Indemnifying Party has not agreed and
acknowledged in writing for the benefit of the Indemnified Party its
unqualified obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party as provided
hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim, subject to the limitations
set forth in this  _Article 8_. If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not elect
to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not
giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or
otherwise, (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to
take steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim or (iii) is
not entitled to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 8.3_ , the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation to, assume such defense and shall
have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its
choosing it being understood that the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification for a Third-Party Claim (including the payment of the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel by
the Indemnifying Party) shall not be adversely affected by assuming the
defense of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party conducts the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, the amount to be paid by the Indemnified
Party in the settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim without the
prior consent of the Indemnifying Party to such payment amount shall not be
deemed determinative of the amount of the indemnification payment owed by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party may enter
into a settlement or consent to any judgment without the consent of the
Indemnified Party so long as (i) such settlement or judgment involves
monetary damages only which are indemnifiable in full by the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnifying Party has funded the payment of such monetary
damages in full, (ii) a term of the settlement or judgment is that the Person
or Persons asserting such Third-Party Claim unconditionally release all
Indemnified Parties from all liability with respect to such claim and (iii)
such settlement does not include any statement or admission of fact regarding
culpability of, or failure to act by or on behalf of, the Indemnified Party;
otherwise the consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required in order to
enter into any settlement of, or consent to the entry of a judgment with
respect to, any Third-Party Claim, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 8.3_ , the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be
at the expense of the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to assume any liability in
excess of the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

8.4 _Other Indemnification Matters_. For purposes of determining
(i) whether there has been any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty (ii) the amount of Losses resulting from any such
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or
referring to the terms "material", "materiality",  "in all material
respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be
disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for purposes of
determining liability under this _Article 8_ , the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and
phrases were not included in them.

8.5 _Release of Escrow Amount from Escrow_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, in the event that
the GTY Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification from the Bonfire
Holders pursuant to this _Article 8_ , the Escrow Agent shall, upon the
receipt of a joint written instruction from GTY and the Bonfire Holders'
Representative, or written instruction from GTY attaching a final non-
appealable court order from a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth
the amount of such Loss, release and transfer to the GTY Indemnitees pursuant
to this _Article 8_ : either (x) an amount in cash equal to 100% of such
Loss, to the extent the GTY Indemnitees have suffered out-of-pocket
Losses, or (y) to the extent such Losses are not out-of-pocket Losses
suffered by any GTY Indemnitee, an amount in cash equal to 50% of such Loss
and the number of Escrow Shares equal to the lesser of: that number of Escrow
Shares then held in the Escrow Account equal to (A) the amount of 50% of the
Loss, _divided by_ (B) the 30-Day VWAP, calculated as of the date of such
payment; and that number of Escrow Shares then held in the Escrow Account
equal to (A) the amount of 50% of the Loss, _divided by_ (B) $10.00, in each
case, subject to the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the
Bonfire Holders shall have the right (" _Cash Settlement Right_ "), but not
the obligation, to (A) pay to any GTY Indemnitee, in cash from the
remaining Cash Escrow Amount, an amount equal to the value of the Escrow
Shares that otherwise would be released and delivered to such GTY Indemnitee
in respect of such Loss or (B) to the extent no GTY Indemnitee has suffered
out-of-pocket Losses, pay to any GTY Indemnitee, in Escrow Shares (calculated
as set forth above), an amount equal to the cash that would otherwise be
released from the Escrow Account and delivered to such GTY Indemnitee in
respect of such Loss.

  



  

(b) Concurrently with any such transfer or release of Escrow Shares
to the Bonfire Holders or to any GTY Indemnitee, each Party shall take all
actions reasonably required to effect such transfer, including delivering
such certificates (if the Escrow Shares are certificated), and related
transfer powers and indemnities or giving written direction to the GTY
Parties' transfer agent (or requiring the Escrow Agent to provide such
written direction) and, in the case of any transfer by Bonfire Holders to any
of the GTY Indemnitees, providing customary representations as to
organization, existence and good standing of the Bonfire Holders, the legal
right and requisite power and authority of the Bonfire Holders to execute and
deliver such instruments of transfer, the ownership and title to the Escrow
Shares so transferred, that each Bonfire Holder has the sole right to transfer
such Escrow Shares and has not granted any rights to purchase or interests of
any kind in such Escrow Shares to any other Person, and that upon the closing
of such transfer by Bonfire Holders to any of the GTY Indemnitees, the GTY
Indemnitees shall receive record, legal and beneficial ownership of and good
title to such Escrow Shares, free and clear of any Liens. Subject to the
exercise by any Bonfire Holder of the Cash Settlement Right, effective upon
delivery of the joint written instruction or final non-appealable court order
from a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the amount of a Loss,
the Bonfire Holders' Representative hereby grants a power of attorney and
proxy in favor of GTY to take any action to consummate any of the actions
contemplated by this _Section 8.5(b)_ in respect of such Loss, which power of
attorney and proxy is irrevocable, coupled with an interest and shall survive
indefinitely

  



  

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in the last sentence of
this _Section 8.6_ , each Party hereby (a) acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of such Party, with
respect to any and all claims for Adverse Consequences arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be pursuant and
subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Article 8_ , and (b) acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent
required by applicable Law to be effective, the agreements, waivers and
releases contained in this  _Section 8.6_ are conspicuous. Notwithstanding
any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article 8_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall in any way impair, modify or
otherwise any Party's right to (y) bring any claim or Proceeding against any
other Party based upon such other Party's intentional misrepresentation or
fraud, or (z) right to seek or obtain specific performance of any covenant or
agreement required to be performed by the terms of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

8.7 _Roll-Up Transactions_. The Company and the Bonfire Holders'
Representative acknowledge and agree that _GTY _ and Exchangeco are not
making any representations or warranties with respect to the Persons (other
than GTY and Exchangeco) that are party to the Roll-Up Transactions, and that
all rights to claims against such Persons will reside solely with GTY
and that none of the Company Parties or the Bonfire Holders will have any
rights whatsoever to make such claims or be subrogated to such claims (except
to the extent where such waiver is not permitted under applicable Law).

indirect, former, current or future stockholders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,

(iii) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Expense
Reimbursement Payment, as and when payable pursuant to this _Section 9.2_

reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which such amount is due and payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
