are able to resolve all Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, shall

recognized firm of independent certified public accountants, which does not have any material relationship with GTY, the Bonfire
Holders&rsquo; Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (such firm, or any successor thereto, the &ldquo;<U>Accounting
Expert</U>&rdquo;) within fifteen (15) days after the end of such 20-day period. If GTY and the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative
are unable to agree upon an Accounting Expert within such&nbsp;15-day period, then the Accounting Expert shall be an accounting
firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York which does not have any material
relationship with GTY, the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative or any of their respective Affiliates. The Bonfire Holders&rsquo;
Representative and GTY shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Expert for its engagement hereunder. The
Accounting Expert shall consider only those Disputed Amounts which GTY and the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative have been
unable to resolve. The Accounting Expert will act as an expert (not an arbitrator) and may select as a resolution the position
of either GTY or the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on presentations and supporting
material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any independent review) or may impose an alternative resolution which cannot
be higher than the highest value or lower than the lowest value presented by each Party for a disputed amount. The Accounting Expert
shall deliver to GTY and the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five
(45)&nbsp;days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of such Disputed Amounts. Such report shall
be final and binding upon the Parties. In selecting such resolution, the Accounting Expert shall rely solely on the terms of this
Agreement and on written submissions and supporting material provided by GTY and the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative, and
at the Accounting Expert&rsquo;s election, pursuant to responses provided by the GTY and the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative
to inquiries posed by the Accounting Expert&rsquo;s review of the foregoing, but not pursuant to an independent review. Upon the
decision of the Accounting Expert, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the
Accounting Expert&rsquo;s decision (and as otherwise adjusted in accordance with this <U>Section 1.6</U>), shall be the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be allocated to and borne by GTY and the
Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Expert&rsquo;s determination (before
such allocation) bears to the Disputed Amount as originally submitted to the Accounting Expert. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Expert awards $600 in favor of the Bonfire Holders&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by GTY and&nbsp;40% of the costs would be borne by the Bonfire Holders&rsquo;
Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no resolution of any Disputed Amount or any facts, circumstances
or events giving rise to any such Disputed Amount, whether by the Accounting Expert otherwise, shall limit the right of any party
to assert and prevail on a claim for a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder pursuant to <U>Article 8</U> (and subject
to the limitations set forth therein).</P>
