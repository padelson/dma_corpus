v ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 

THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of May 12, 2010, by
and between: VERAZ NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent") and
DIALOGIC CORPORATION, a British Columbia corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS 

A. Parent intends to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares in
exchange for shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Agreement,
the Plan of Arrangement and the BCBCA.

 

B. The respective boards of directors of Parent and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the Arrangement, and contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, the shareholders of the Company have executed a
Company Support Agreement pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to
vote in favor of the Arrangement and certain stockholders of Parent have
executed Parent Voting Agreements pursuant to which such stockholders have
agreed to vote in favor of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Arrangement and at the Parent Stockholders Meeting. 

AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



   1. | DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION 
---|--- 
 

1.1. The Arrangement. The parties agree to effect the Arrangement under the
BCBCA pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement. Upon completion of the Arrangement:

 

(a) Each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be and be deemed to be irrevocably transferred to Parent in exchange
for the Share Consideration.

(b) _Intentionally Deleted_. __

(c) Upon the transfer of all Company Shares to Parent:

 

(i) each holder of such Company Shares shall cease to be the holder of such
Company Shares and such holders name shall be removed from the applicable
securities register of the Company;

 

(ii) legal and beneficial title to such Company Shares will vest in Parent
and Parent will be and be deemed to be the transferee and legal and
beneficial owner of such Company Shares and will be entered in the applicable
securities register of the Company as the sole shareholder thereof;

 

(iii) no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Arrangement, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Shares who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the last trading day prior
to the Closing Date;



 

1 (iv) with respect to each share of Parent Common Stock issued to a former
holder of Company Shares, the name of such holder shall be entered in the
register of holders of Parent Common Stock as the registered holder thereof;

 

(v) without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holders of
Company Options, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised (a
"Company Unexercised Option") shall be cancelled in accordance with the terms
of the Company Option Plan and, in exchange for such cancellation, such
holder shall receive an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock with
substantially the same terms and conditions (including the terms and
conditions of any applicable stock option agreement or other document
evidencing such Company Option, if any) as were in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions, if
applicable), except that (A) each Company Unexercised Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) solely
for a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(1) the number of Company Common Shares that would be issuable upon
exercise of the Company Unexercised Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time _multiplied by_ (2) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such Company Unexercised Option will be equal to the quotient equal to (1)
the per share exercise price for such Company Unexercised Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time  _divided by_ (2) the Option Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent (a "Parent Replacement Option"). Each
Company Unexercised Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective
Time as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto
as it was vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent
such Company Unexercised Option (either by its terms or by the terms of
another Contract) provides for acceleration of vesting thereof. Each Company
Unexercised Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to
the Effective Time. The exercise price under each Company Unexercised Option,
the number of shares for which such Company Unexercised Option is exercisable
and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Company Unexercised Option
shall be determined in such manner so as to comply to the greatest extent
possible with Subsection 7(1.4) of the Canadian Tax Act and the equivalent
provisions under applicable provincial law;

(vi) the Company Option Plan shall be cancelled; and 

(vii) without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder
of that certain warrant to purchase Company Common Shares dated as of October
5, 2007 issued by the Company (the "Warrant"), the Warrant shall be terminated
as of the Closing and shall be of no further force or effect.

 

1.2. Effective Time. The Arrangement shall become effective at the
Effective Time on the Closing Date.

1.3. Closing. The consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Stikeman Elliott LLP, 1155,
Rene-Levesque Blvd, West, 40th Floor, Montreal, QC H3B 3V2, on a date to
be mutually agreed by the Company and Parent, and in the absence of such
mutual agreement, shall be no later than the fifth Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7 and 8 (other than conditions which by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of each of such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually takes
place is referred to as the "Closing Date."

1.4. Exemption from Registration Requirements. The parties agree that the
Arrangement will be carried out in such manner as to ensure that all shares of
Parent Common Stock and Parent Replacement Options issued upon completion of
the Arrangement to holders of Company Shares and Company Unexercised Options,
as the case may be, will be issued by Parent in reliance upon the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section
3(a)(10) of the Securities Act.

 



 

2 1.5. Issuance of Certificates Representing Parent Common Stock. 

(a) Parent shall, at or as soon as practicable following the Closing,
deliver to each Company Shareholder (or to a Person designated by such
Company Shareholder pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 1.5(a)),
and in the case of each of GW Invest APS ("KonnerupCo") and APS KBUS 17 nr.
2101 ("JensenCo"), in accordance with Section 1.5(c), a certificate
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder as determined in accordance with Section 1.1. No later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each Company Shareholder shall
deliver to Parent written instructions regarding (i) the Person in whose name
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder shall be registered
and (ii) the Person to whom the certificate(s) representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be delivered at the Closing, and Parent shall issue
and deliver the certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with such instructions. 

(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that was not
registered in the securities register of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to the transferee if the certificate representing such Company Shares is
presented to Company, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.5,
each certificate which immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time
represented one or more Company Shares that, under the Arrangement, were
transferred or were deemed to be transferred for shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.1, shall be deemed at all times at and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive as contemplated by this Section 1.5.

 

(c) Parent is advised that KonnerupCo and JensenCo have pledged their
shares in the Company to Amagerbanken Aktieselskab ("Amagerbanken") including
any proceeds and shares issued by any other corporation in exchange therefore.
Parent agrees that the certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to each of KonnerupCo and JensenCo pursuant to this Section
1.5 will be promptly delivered to Amagerbanken or to such person as
Amagerbanken shall direct in writing prior to the Effective Time and the Share
Consideration received by each of KonnerupCo and JensenCo pursuant to the
Plan of Arrangement are and shall be pledged in favor of Amagerbanken. Parent
acknowledges that it has, by execution of this Agreement, been notified of the
Amagerbanken pledge on the Share Consideration issuable to KonnerupCo

Certificate") having a certificate limit of no less than the fair market value
of the Share Consideration to which such Non-Canadian is entitled.

 



 

3 (b) Each Non-Canadian shall take all reasonable steps to obtain and

letter of credit in an amount in Canadian dollars equal to the Total Withheld
Consideration (the "Letter of Credit"), or such other security or guarantee
reasonably acceptable to Parent ("Other Security" and together with the Letter
of Credit, the "Security"), in which case Parent shall deliver to such Non-

its Company Shares. The Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable, shall be in
favour of Parent, shall be issued by a Canadian Schedule 1 bank or such other
bank accepted in writing by Parent and shall be payable upon demand from time
to time and at any time by Parent confirming in writing that it is required by
law to remit all or a portion of the Federal Withheld Consideration or the

treated as the owner of the shares transferred into the Escrow Account for all
applicable Tax purposes, (iii) the Shareholder Escrow Agent shall, upon being
directed to do so by Parent, sell the Total Withheld Consideration on behalf
of the Non-Canadian to a third party that is not (x) a Company Shareholder as

any entity that is controlled by the same group of shareholders as the
shareholders of the Parent (each, an "Approved Party") and remit the net cash
proceeds from the sale of the Total Withheld Consideration (the "Total
Withheld Amount", and the portions of the Total Withheld Amount relating to
the sale of the Federal Withheld Consideration and the Quebec Withheld
Consideration, respectively, the "Federal Withheld Amount" and the "Quebec
Withheld Amount") to Stikeman Elliott LLP (the "Escrow Agent"), which shall
hold such

 



 

4  amount, in Canadian dollars, in trust pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement until paid to the Non-Canadian or remitted to the Receiver General
for Canada or to the MRQ in accordance with this Section 1.6.

(g) Notwithstanding Section 1.6(f) above, Parent shall not be required to
transfer all or any part of the Total Withheld Consideration to the
Shareholder Escrow Agent in the event that any relevant Non-Canadian provides
to Parent a guarantee and indemnity by or on behalf of the Non-Canadian in
form and substance satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably. In the event
that such a guarantee and indemnity is provided, Parent shall continue to hold
the Total Withheld Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section
1.6. In the event that such a guarantee and indemnity shall not be honored at
the appropriate time, Parent shall transfer the Total Withheld Consideration
to the Shareholder Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Escrow Agent shall be
directed to sell all or any portion of the Total Withheld Consideration on
behalf of the Non-Canadian to an Approved Party and remit the proceeds to the
Escrow Agent to allow Parent to effect the payments required to be made by

of, or associated therewith: U.S. and non-U.S. (i) non-expired patents,

"Trade Secrets"), (iii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names
and Internet domain names and registrations and applications therefor, and
equivalents thereof throughout the world, (iv) copyrights, mask works,

"Registered Intellectual Property" shall mean all



 

11  registered copyrights and trademarks and all issued or validated Patents;

item of Intellectual Property in which it has an ownership interest
(collectively, the "Company Owned Intellectual Property"), and has the right
to use all other Company Intellectual Property, in each case free and clear
of all Encumbrances; _provided that_ the applicable Company Acquired
Corporation complies with the terms of the relevant Contract associated with
such Company Intellectual Property, including the payment of royalties and/or
license fees. A Company Acquired Corporation is listed in the records of the
appropriate U.S. and/or non-U.S. Governmental Body as the sole and exclusive
owner of record for each copyright or trademark registration or Patent grant
included in the Company Owned Intellectual Property listed in Part 2.9(a) of

of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) To the Companys Knowledge, the Company Intellectual Property and all
of the Company Acquired Corporations rights therein, is and are valid and
enforceable. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts, proceedings,
claims or challenges that cause or would cause any Company Intellectual
Property to be invalid or unenforceable, or challenging the Company Acquired
Corporations rights in any Company Intellectual Property, and no Company
Acquired Corporation has received any notice from any Person bringing or
threatening to bring such proceedings, claims or challenges. No act has been
done or omitted to be done by the Company Acquired Corporations, which has,
had or could have the effect of impairing or dedicating to the public, or
entitling any Person to cancel, forfeit, modify or consider abandoned, any
Company Owned Intellectual Property, except as it relates to any Company
Owned Intellectual Property abandoned, cancelled or allowed to expire in the
ordinary course of business. Except as it relates to Company Owned
Intellectual Property abandoned, cancelled or allowed to expire in the
ordinary course of business, all necessary registration, maintenance and
renewal fees in respect of the Company Owned Intellectual Property have been
paid and all necessary documents and certificates have been filed with the
relevant Governmental Bodies for the purpose of maintaining such Company Owned
Intellectual Property. No Company Acquired Corporation has divulged, furnished
to or made accessible any of its Trade Secrets to any Person who is
not subject to an enforceable written agreement to maintain the
confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, and the Company Acquired Corporations
otherwise take and have taken reasonable measures to maintain the
confidentiality of their Trade Secrets. 

(d) To the Companys Knowledge and except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or would reasonably be expected to have or result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company Acquired Corporations or
any of their respective current activities, or products misappropriates,
violates or otherwise conflicts with, or has infringed, misappropriated or
violated or otherwise conflicted with any Intellectual Property of any Person,
and no Company Acquired Corporation has received any notice within the
previous two years nor is any of them subject to any actual or threatened
proceedings claiming or alleging any of the foregoing. No proceedings or
claims in which a Company Acquired Corporation alleges that any Person is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Owned Intellectual
Property are pending, and none have been served by, instituted or asserted by
a Company Acquired Corporation. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no
breaches or defaults of, or any disputes or threatened disputes concerning,
any of the IP Contracts. 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) result in the loss of, or
otherwise adversely affect, any material rights of the Company Acquired
Corporations in any Company Intellectual Property, or (ii) grant or require
any Company Acquired Corporation to grant to any Person any rights with
respect to any Company Intellectual Property, except where such rights would
be extended to the Acquiring Corporations through IP Contracts, (iii) subject
any Company Acquired Corporation to any increase in royalties or other
payments in respect of any Company Intellectual Property, (iv) diminish any
royalties or other payments the Company Acquired Corporations would otherwise
be entitled to in respect of any Company Intellectual Property, or (v) result
in the material breach or, by the terms of such contract, termination of any
material Company Contract.



 

12 (f) None of the Company Intellectual Property has been developed with the
assistance or use of any funding from third parties or third party agencies,
including funding from any Governmental Body.

 

(g) There has been no disclosure of Software distributed by the Company
other than through licensing of object code versions or source code versions,
pursuant to a Company Contract. Each copy so distributed is the subject of a
valid, existing and enforceable license agreement. Other than as relates to
Intentionally Disclosed Software, each Person who has received Company owned
Software source code is bound by an appropriate confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreement with respect such Software and, to the Companys
Knowledge, there are no breaches of any such agreements or any
threatened disputes or disagreements with respect to them.

(h) With the exception of Intentionally Disclosed Software, the Company
has treated Company owned Software as confidential and proprietary business
information, and has taken all reasonable steps to protect the same as trade
secrets of the Company. Such source code is fully documented in a manner that
a reasonably skilled programmer could understand, modify, compile and
otherwise utilize all aspects of the related computer programs without
reference to other sources of information. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the Intellectual Property relating to such Company owned Software does not
contain any undisclosed program routine, device or other feature, including
viruses, worms, bugs, time locks, Trojan horses or back doors, in each case
that is designed to delete, disable, deactivate, interfere with or otherwise
harm such Software, and any virus or other intentionally created, undocumented
contaminant that may, or may be used to, access, modify, delete, damage or
disable any hardware, system or data.

 

(i) All current and former employees and consultants of the Company whose
duties or responsibilities relate to the Companys business have entered into
confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and proprietary information
agreements with and in favor of the Company in substantially the same form as
has been provided to Parent. Each such Person has waived its non-assignable
rights (including moral rights) to any Intellectual Property created by it on
behalf of the Company _._

Disclosure Schedule, no Company Employee Plan is or was at any time a
multiple employer plan as described in Section 413 of the Code or within the
meaning of pension legislation in Canada.

 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (alone and not in connection
with any other event, including any termination of employment or service) will
(i) result in any payment (including severance, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise), becoming due to any Company Associate under any Company Employee
Plan or Company Employee Agreement, (ii) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness, (iii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by the
Company under any Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement, (iv)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, (v) results
in an obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee Plan
or (vi) be reasonably likely to result in any payment to any Company Associate
that would not be deductible by any of the Company Acquired Corporations, as
the case may be, by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or by virtue of the
Canadian Tax Act. Part 2.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the Company Employee Plans and Company Employee Agreements giving rise to the
potential "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code) payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions, alone and not in connection with any other
event.

 

(i) No Company Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any
liability of any of the Company Acquired Corporations to provide, retiree
life insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare
benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or
other applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(j) Except as set forth in Part 2.14(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Acquired Corporation: (i) has
violated or otherwise failed to comply with any Legal Requirement respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment,
including wages, hours, vacation pay, pay equity, overtime pay, occupational
health and safety, the health care continuation requirements of COBRA, the
requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the requirements of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the
provisions of any similar Legal Requirement; (ii) has failed to withhold or
report any amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to
be withheld or reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
Company Associates; (iii) is liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or
any penalty for failure to comply with the Legal Requirements applicable to
any of the foregoing; and (iv) is liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with
respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other
benefits or obligations for Company Associates (other than routine payments to
be made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice).
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
reasonably anticipated claims or Legal Proceedings against any of the Company
Acquired Corporations under any workers compensation policy.

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, no shareholder of the Company, and
no current Company Associate, is obligated under any Contract or subject to
any Order that would interfere with such Persons efforts to promote the
interests of the Company Acquired Corporations or that would interfere with
the businesses of the Company Acquired Corporations.



 

19 (l) Part 2.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies
each Company Employee Plan that is an International Plan. Without limiting the
generality of this Section 2.14(l), each International Plan required to be
registered with any applicable Governmental Body and other
regulatory authorities has been so registered. With respect to each
International Plan for which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be
maintained, full and timely payment has been made of all amounts required of
any Company Acquired Corporation under the terms of such International Plan
or applicable Legal Requirement, as applied through the Closing Date. The
current value of the assets of each such International Plan, as of the end of
the most recently ended plan year of that International Plan, equals or
exceeded the current value of all benefits liabilities under that
International Plan. For purposes of this Section 2.14(l), "International Plan"
means any Company Employee Plan that is maintained outside the United States
primarily for the benefit of Persons substantially all of whom are nonresident
aliens within the meaning of the Code, other than a plan maintained primarily
for the benefit of Company Associates resident in Canada.

actions at such site.

Corporation has an ownership interest and all other Intellectual Property that
is used by or licensed to the Acquiring Corporations.

 

(b) An Acquiring Corporation is the owner or joint owner of each item of

Parent Intellectual Property, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances;
provided that the applicable Acquiring Corporation complies with the terms of

Intellectual Property listed in Part 3.8(a) of the Parent Disclosure

27 (c) To the Parents Knowledge, the Parent Intellectual Property and all of
the Acquiring Corporations rights therein, is and are valid and enforceable.
To the Parents Knowledge, there are no facts, proceedings, claims or
challenges that cause or would cause any Parent Intellectual Property to be
invalid or unenforceable, or challenging the Acquiring Corporations rights in
any Parent Intellectual Property, and no Acquiring Corporation has received
any notice from any Person bringing or threatening to bring such
proceedings, claims or challenges. No act has been done or omitted to be done
by an Acquiring Corporation, which has, had or could have the effect of
impairing or dedicating to the public, or entitling any Person to cancel,
forfeit, modify or consider abandoned, any Parent Owned Intellectual
Property, except as it relates to any Parent Owned Intellectual Property
abandoned, cancelled or allowed to expire in the ordinary course of business.
Except as it relates to Parent Owned Intellectual Property abandoned,
cancelled or allowed to expire in the ordinary course of business, all
necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in respect of the Parent
Owned Intellectual Property have been paid and all necessary documents and
certificates have been filed with the relevant Governmental Body for the
purpose of maintaining such Parent Owned Intellectual Property. No Acquiring
Corporation has divulged, furnished to or made accessible any of its Trade
Secrets to any Person who is not subject to an enforceable written agreement
to maintain the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets, and the Acquiring
Corporations otherwise take and have taken reasonable measures to maintain the
confidentiality of their Trade Secrets.

 

(d) To the Parents Knowledge and except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or would reasonably be expected to have or result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, none of the Acquiring Corporations or any of
their respective current activities, or products misappropriates, violates or
otherwise conflicts with, or has infringed, misappropriated, violated or
otherwise conflicted with any Intellectual Property of any Person, and no
Acquiring Corporation has received any notice within the previous two years
nor is any of them subject to any actual or threatened proceedings claiming
or alleging any of the foregoing. No proceedings or claims in which an
Acquiring Corporation alleges that any Person is infringing, misappropriating
or otherwise violating any Parent Owned Intellectual Property are pending, and
none have been served by, instituted or asserted by an Acquiring Corporation.
To the Parents Knowledge, there are no breaches or defaults of, or any
disputes or threatened disputes concerning, any of the Parent IP Contracts.

 

(e) Except as set forth in Part 3.8(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of Parent, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not (i) result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely
affect, any material rights of the Acquiring Corporations in any Parent
Intellectual Property, or (ii) grant or require any Acquiring Corporation to
grant to any Person any rights with respect to any Parent Intellectual
Property, (iii) subject any Acquiring Corporation to any increase in royalties
or other payments in respect of any Parent Intellectual Property, (iv)
diminish any royalties or other payments the Acquiring Corporations would
otherwise be entitled to in respect of any Parent Intellectual Property, or
(v) result in the material breach or, by the terms of such
contract, termination of any material IP Contract to which an Acquiring
Corporation is a party or is otherwise bound.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Part 3.8(f) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Parent Intellectual Property has been developed with the
assistance or use of any funding from third parties or third party agencies,
including funding from any Governmental Body.

 

(g) There has been no disclosure of Software distributed by Parent other
than through licensing of object code versions or source code versions
pursuant to the applicable Contract. Each copy so distributed is the subject
of a valid, existing and enforceable license agreement. Other than as relates
to Intentionally Disclosed Software, each Person who has received Parent
owned Software source code is bound by an appropriate confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreement with respect such Software and, to Parents Knowledge,
there are no breaches of any such agreements or any threatened disputes
or disagreements with respect to them.

(h) With the exception of Intentionally Disclosed Software, Parent has
treated Parent owned Software as confidential and proprietary business
information, and has taken all reasonable steps to protect the same as

 



 

28  trade secrets of Parent. Such source code is fully documented in a manner
that a reasonably skilled programmer could understand, modify, compile and
otherwise utilize all aspects of the related computer programs without
reference to other sources of information. To the Knowledge of Parent, the
Intellectual Property relating to such Parent owned Software does not contain
any undisclosed program routine, device or other feature, including viruses,
worms, bugs, time locks, Trojan horses or back doors, in each case that is
designed to delete, disable, deactivate, interfere with or otherwise harm such
Software, and any virus or other intentionally created, undocumented
contaminant that may, or may be used to, access, modify, delete, damage or
disable any hardware, system or data.

 

(i) All current and former employees and consultants of Parent whose duties
or responsibilities relate to Parents business have entered into
confidentiality, intellectual property assignment and proprietary information
agreements with and in favor of Parent in substantially the same form as has
been provided to the Company. Each such Person has waived its non-assignable
rights (including moral rights) to any Intellectual Property created by it on
behalf of Parent.

otherwise), becoming due to any Parent Associate under any Parent Employee
Plan or Parent Employee Agreement, (ii) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness, (iii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by
Parent under any Parent Employee Plan or Parent Employee Agreement, (iv)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, (v) results
in an obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Parent Employee Plan
or (vi) be reasonably likely to result in any payment to any Parent Associate
that would not be deductible by any of the Acquiring Corporations, as the case
may be, by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. Part 3.13(h) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Parent Employee Plans and Parent Employee
Agreement giving rise to the potential "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) payable by an Acquiring Corporation in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, alone and not in connection
with any other event.

(i) No Parent Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any
liability of any of the Acquiring Corporations to provide, retiree life
insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare benefits
to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other
applicable Legal Requirements.

(j) Except as set forth in Part 3.13(j) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no Acquiring Corporation: (i) has violated or
otherwise failed to comply with any Legal Requirement respecting employment,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, including wages,
hours, vacation pay, pay equity, overtime pay, occupational health and safety,
the health care continuation requirements of COBRA, the requirements of the
Family and Medical Leave Act, the requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and



 

34  Accountability Act of 1996 and the provisions of any similar Legal
Requirement; (ii) has failed to withhold or report any amounts required by
applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to be withheld or reported with
respect to wages, salaries and other payments to Parent Associates; (iii) is
liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any penalty for failure to
comply with the Legal Requirements applicable to any of the foregoing; and
(iv) is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for Parent Associates (other than routine payments to be made in
the normal course of business and consistent with past practice). There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated
claims or Legal Proceedings against any of the Acquiring Corporations under
any workers compensation policy.

(k) To the Knowledge of Parent, no stockholder of Parent, and no current
Parent Associate, is obligated under any Contract or subject to any Order that
would interfere with such Persons efforts to promote the interests of the
Acquiring Corporations or that would interfere with the businesses of the
Acquiring Corporations.

(l) Part 3.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule separately identifies
each Parent Employee Plan that is an International Plan. Without limiting the
generality of this Section 3.13(l), each International Plan required to be
registered with any applicable Governmental Body and other regulatory
authorities has been so registered. With respect to each International Plan
for which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full
and timely payment has been made of all amounts required of any Acquiring
Corporation under the terms of such International Plan or applicable Legal
Requirement, as applied through the Closing Date. The current value of the
assets of each such International Plan, as of the end of the most recently
ended plan year of that International Plan, equals or exceeded the current
value of all benefits liabilities under that International Plan. For purposes
of this Section 3.13(l), "International Plan" means any Parent Employee
Plan that is maintained outside the United States primarily for the benefit
of Persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens within the meaning
of the Code.

 

3.14. Environmental Matters.

 

(a) Since December 31, 2007, none of the Acquiring Corporations has
received any notice or other communication, whether from a Governmental Body,
citizens group, Parent Associate or otherwise, that alleges that any of the
Acquiring Corporations is not or might not be in compliance with any
Environmental Law, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the compliance by any of the
Acquiring Corporations with any Environmental Law in the future.

 

(b) To the Knowledge of Parent, and except as would not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect:
(i) all property that is or was leased to or controlled, owned or used by any

soil vapors associated with or adjacent to such property, is free of any
Materials of Environmental Concern or material environmental contamination of
any nature; (ii) none of the property that is or was leased to or controlled,
owned or used by any of the Acquiring Corporations contains any above ground
or underground storage tanks, waste treatment systems, asbestos, asbestos-

(iii) none of the property that is or was leased to or controlled, owned or
used by the Acquiring Corporations contains any tanks or sumps in which
process wastewater or any Materials of Environmental Concern have been

send or transport, any Materials of Environmental Concern to a site that,

(ii) is otherwise designated or identified as a potential site for
remediation, cleanup, closure or other environmental remedial activity; or

cost of investigating or conducting any removal or remedial actions at such
site.



 

35 3.15. Insurance. All fire and casualty, general liability, business
interruption, product liability, sprinkler and water damage insurance policies
and other forms of insurance maintained by any of the Acquiring Corporations
have been provided or made available to the Company. To the Knowledge
of Parent, each such policy is in full force and effect and all premiums due
thereon have been paid in full.

 

3.16. Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in Part 3.16 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule: (a) no Related Party has, and no Related Party
has had, any direct or indirect interest in any material asset used in or
otherwise relating to the business of any of the Acquiring Corporations; (b)
no Related Party is, or has been, indebted to any of the Acquiring
Corporations; (c) no Related Party has entered into, or has had any direct or
indirect financial interest in, any Parent Material Contract, transaction or
business dealing involving any of the Acquiring Corporations; (d) no Related
Party is competing, or has competed, directly or indirectly, with any of the
Acquiring Corporations; and (e) no Related Party has any claim or right
against any of the Acquiring Corporations (other than rights under any Parent
Options and rights to receive compensation for services performed as an
employee of Parent). For purposes of this Section 3.16, each of the following
shall be deemed to be a "Related Party": (i) each individual who is, or who
has at any time since December 31, 2007 been, an officer or director of any of
the Acquiring Corporations; (ii) each member of the immediate family of each
of the Persons referred to in clause "(i)" above; and (iii) any trust or

individuals collectively hold), beneficially or otherwise, a material voting,
proprietary or equity interest.

3.17. Legal Proceedings; Orders.

Person has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding: (i) that involves any
of the Acquiring Corporations, any business of any of the Acquiring
Corporations or any of the assets owned, leased or used by any of the
Acquiring Corporations; or (ii) that challenges, or that may have the effect
of preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with, the
Arrangement or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. None of the Legal
Proceedings identified in Part 3.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule has
had or, if adversely determined, would have or would reasonably be expected to
have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other condition or
circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to give rise to or
serve as a basis for the commencement of any Legal Proceeding of the type
described in clause "(i)" or clause "(ii)" of the first sentence of this
Section 3.17(a).

 

(b) There is no Order to which any of the Acquiring Corporations, or any of
the assets owned or used by any of the Acquiring Corporations, is subject. To
the Knowledge of Parent, no officer or other key employee of any of the
Acquiring Corporations is subject to any Order that prohibits such officer or
other employee from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or
practice relating to the business of any of the Acquiring Corporations.

 

3.18. Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Subject to obtaining the
Required Parent Stockholder Vote with respect to the Arrangement, Parent has

binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with
its

 



 

36  terms, subject to: (A) laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors; and (B) rules of law governing specific
performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

3.19. Anti-takeover Statutes. The board of directors of Parent has
approved this Agreement and taken all other requisite action such that the
restrictions of any antitakeover laws will not apply to this Agreement or any
of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

3.20. Vote Required. The only vote of Parents stockholders required to
approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Arrangement is
the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on the proposal in
person or by proxy at the Parent Stockholders Meeting (the "Required Parent
Stockholder Vote").

3.21. Non-Contravention; Consents. Except as set forth in Part 3.21 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Parent and except as would not
have and would not reasonably be expected to have or result in, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither (1)
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the other
Contracts referred to in this Agreement, nor (2) the consummation of the
Arrangement or any of the other Contemplated Transactions will directly or
indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time):

(a) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of: (i) any of the
provisions of the articles/certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
charter or organizational documents of any of the Acquiring Corporations; or
(ii) any resolution adopted by the stockholders, the board of directors
or any committee of the board of directors of Parent;

(b) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of, or give any
Governmental Body or other Person the right to challenge the Arrangement or

Acquiring Corporations, or any of the assets owned or used by any of the
Acquiring Corporations, is subject;

 

(c) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any of the terms

the business of any of the Acquiring Corporations or to any of the assets
owned or used by any of the Acquiring Corporations;

delivery schedule under any such Contract; (iii) accelerate the maturity or
performance of any such Parent Material Contract; or (iv) cancel, terminate or

respect to any asset owned or used by any of the Acquiring Corporations
(except for minor liens that will not, in any case or in the aggregate,
materially detract from the value of the assets subject thereto or materially
impair the operations of any of the Acquiring Corporations).

(f) except as may be required by the Securities Act, Exchange Act, the HSR
Act, any foreign Antitrust Laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq,
Parent was not, is not and will not be required to make any filing with or
give any notice to, or to obtain any Consent from, any Person in connection
with: (x) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions; or (y) the consummation of the
Arrangement or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. For purposes of
this Agreement, an Acquiring Corporation will be deemed to be or to have been
"required" to obtain a Consent if the failure to obtain such Consent (i) could
result in the imposition of any liability or obligation on, or the expansion
of any liability or obligation of, any of the Acquiring Corporations, (ii)
could result in the termination,



 

37  modification or limitation of any contractual or other right of any of the
Acquiring Corporations, or (iii) could otherwise have an adverse effect on the
business, condition, capitalization, assets, Intellectual Property,
liabilities, results of operations, financial performance or prospects of any
of the Acquiring Corporations.

 

3.22. Receivables. Part 3.22 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule accurately
identifies, and provides an accurate and complete breakdown of the revenues
received from, each customer or other Person that accounted for revenues of at
least $1,000,000 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. Parent has not
received any notice or other communication, and has not received any other
information, indicating that any customer or other Person identified or
required to be identified in Part 3.22 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule may
cease dealing with any of the Acquiring Corporations. Part 3.22 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule identifies, as of the date of this Agreement, each Person
that, pursuant to any Contract with any Acquiring Corporation, is required to
pay to an Acquiring Corporation after the date of this Agreement $500,000 or
more in cash if any payments under such Contract have not been recognized as
revenue by any Acquiring Corporation on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company information
setting forth the amount of cash that the Acquiring Corporations expect to
receive from each Person referred to in the immediately preceding sentence.

 

3.23. Fairness Opinion. Parents board of directors has received the
written opinion of Page Mill Partners LLC, financial advisor to Parent, dated
May 8, 2010, to the effect that the exchange of all the Company Shares for
newly issued shares of Parent Common Stock equal to seventy percent of the
capital stock of Parent immediately following the Closing and the exchange of
Company Unexercised Options for options to purchase Parent Common Stock having
substantially equal terms and conditions is fair, from a financial point of
view, to Parent and the holders of Parent Common Stock.

3.24. Financial Advisor. Except for Page Mill Partners LLC, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the Arrangement or any of the other

paid by Parent to Page Mill Partners LLC and its affiliates and all fees,
commissions and other amounts that may become payable to Page Mill Partners
LLC and its affiliates by Parent if the Arrangement is consummated will not
exceed $1,200,000. Parent has furnished to the Company accurate and complete

the BCBCA for an Interim Order providing for, among other things, the calling
and holding of the Company Meeting for the purpose of considering and, if

(b) in accordance with the Interim Order, as soon as reasonably
practicable, convene and hold the Company Meeting or obtain the Written
Consent for the purposes of approving the Arrangement Resolutions;

Meeting, use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Company
Shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Arrangement Resolutions,
in a manner consistent with past practice;

 

(d) in addition to the approval of the Arrangement Resolutions, use all
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such other approvals, if any, as are
required by the Interim Order and proceed with and diligently pursue the
application to the Court for the Final Order; and

 

(e) subject to obtaining the Final Order, file a certified copy of the
Final Order, Articles of Arrangement and such other documentation as may be
required for acceptance and endorsement by the Registrar to give effect to the
Arrangement pursuant to Section 292 of the BCBCA.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.1,
at any time prior to Parent obtaining the Required Parent Stockholder Vote,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the board of directors
of the Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after
giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the Parent
pursuant to clause (C) below, the board of directors of the Company may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal



 

46  counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements (assuming for purposes of
this Section 6.1(f) that the DGCL and relevant case law are also applicable
Legal Requirements with respect to determining a board of directors duties to
its stockholders); _provided_ that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause, and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays the termination fee
payable pursuant to Section 9.3(c); and _provided further_ , that the board
of directors of the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause unless: (A) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in advance (the "Company Notice

current form or draft of any written agreement providing for the Acquisition
Transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal and other material
documents; (B) Parent does not make, during the Company Notice Period, a
binding, unconditional written offer (including the complete form of
definitive acquisition agreement executed on behalf of Parent and all
exhibits and other attachments thereto, subject to acceptance by the Company
by countersignature on behalf of the Company, and subject to no other
conditions whatsoever) that the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor (who
shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm) is at least as
favorable from a financial point of view to the shareholders of the Company as
such Superior Proposal; and (C) prior to terminating this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Company Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the board of directors of the
Company to conclude that such Acquisition Proposal has ceased to constitute a
Superior Proposal. In the event of a change to (i) the aggregate consideration
to be provided as part of the Superior Proposal or (ii) other material
financial terms of the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 6.1(f) with respect to such new written notice, except that
the Company Notice Period shall be reduced to two Business Days.

whom notice is to be provided in respect of the Arrangement and for the
Company Meeting and for the manner in which such notice is to be provided;

Shareholders, (ii) the holders of the Company Common Shares and (iii) the
holders of the Company Preferred Shares, in each case present in person or by
proxy at the Company Meeting, voting as a single class, each Company Share
entitling the holder thereof to one vote on the Arrangement Resolutions;

 

(c) provide that the terms, restrictions and conditions of constating
documents of the Company, including quorum requirements and all other
matters, shall apply in respect of the Company Meeting;

 

(d) provide for the notice requirements with respect to the presentation of

Meeting Statement, comply with the Interim Order and all applicable Legal
Requirements.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other if at
any time before the Effective Time it becomes aware that the Arrangement
Meeting Statement, an application for a Governmental Authorization or any
other order, registration, consent, ruling, exemption, no-action letter or
approval, any registration statement or any circular or other filing under
applicable Legal Requirements contains an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or that otherwise requires an

or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading

or completeness of any information furnished by the Company to Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement).

 

(c) The Company shall review the Proxy Statement and shall ensure, as of
the date of mailing the Proxy Statement to holders of Parent Common Stock,
that the information relating to the Company contained in the Proxy Statement
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Arrangement will (to the extent
required) be registered or qualified or exempt from registration or

soon as practicable following the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC
and the completion of the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, and Parent
shall not adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if there are
sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. Parents obligation to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any
Superior Proposal or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any

 



 

49  Adverse Recommendation Change unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof. Parent shall ensure that all proxies solicited
in connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting are solicited in

Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a

outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements;  _provided_
that Parent shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (ii), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause

Period, a binding, unconditional written offer (including the complete form of
definitive acquisition agreement executed on behalf of the Company and all
exhibits and other attachments thereto, subject to acceptance by Parent by
countersignature on behalf of Parent, and subject to no other conditions

unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days
commencing on the date that Parent gives the Company notice of such inaccuracy
or breach;

Parents regulatory compliance obligations existing as of the date of this

of the date of this Agreement; or (iii) payment of a fine, penalty or similar
sanction, whether such payment is to be made in a single lump sum or in
installment payments, of an aggregate amount equal to or in excess of

ARRANGEMENT



   3.1 | Arrangement 
---|--- 

Commencing on the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be
deemed to occur in the following order without any further authorization, act
or formality of or by the Company, Parent or any other Person:

 



     | (a) | Each Class A Convertible Preferred Share, Class B
Convertible Preferred Share, Class C Convertible Preferred Share and Company
Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be and
be deemed to be irrevocably transferred to Parent in exchange for, in each
case, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock as determined in accordance
with the formula set out on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Upon the transfer of all Company Shares to Parent: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | each holder of such Company Shares shall cease to be the
holder of such Company Shares and such holders name shall be removed from the
applicable securities register of Company Shares; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | legal and beneficial title to such Company Shares will vest
in Parent and Parent will be and be deemed to be the transferee and legal and
beneficial owner of such Company Shares and will be entered in the applicable
securities register of the Company as the sole shareholder thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Arrangement, and no certificates or scrip for
any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Shares who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share, be paid in cash
the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of
Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Market on the last trading day prior to the
Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | with respect to each share of Parent Common Stock issued to
a former holder of Company Shares, the name of such holder shall be entered in
the register of holders of Parent Common Stock as the registered holder
thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holders of
Company Options, except as otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised (a
"Company Unexercised Option") shall be cancelled in accordance with the terms
of the Company Option Plan and, in exchange for such cancellation, such holder
shall receive an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock with
substantially the same terms and conditions (including the terms and
conditions of any applicable stock option agreement or other document
evidencing such Company Option, if any) as were in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions,
if applicable), except that (i) each Company Unexercised Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) solely
for a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
(x) the number of Company Common Shares that would be issuable 

---|---|--- 
 



 

Sched. A-4 prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Option Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Company Unexercised Option will be equal to the
quotient equal to (x) the per share exercise price for such Company
Unexercised Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y)
the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (a "Parent
Replacement Option"). Each Company Unexercised Option shall be vested
immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the
total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except to the extent such Company Unexercised Option
(either by its terms or by the terms of another Contract) provides for
acceleration of vesting thereof. Each Company Unexercised Option shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment to reflect any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction subsequent to the Effective Time. The exercise price under
each Company Unexercised Option, the number of shares for which such Company
Unexercised Option is exercisable and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such Company Unexercised Option shall be determined in such manner so as to
comply to the greatest extent possible with Subsection 7(1.4) of the Canadian
Tax Act and the equivalent provisions under applicable provincial law; 
---|--- 



     | (vi) | The Company Option Plan shall be cancelled; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder of that certain warrant to purchase Company Common Shares dated as
of October 5, 2007 issued by the Company (the "Warrant"), the Warrant shall
be terminated as of the Closing and shall be of no further force or effect. 
---|---|--- 



   3.2 | Condition precedent to the Implementation of the Plan of
Arrangement 
---|--- 
 

The implementation of this Plan of Arrangement is conditional upon the
Acquisition Agreement not having been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

Stock 
---|--- 
 

Parent shall, at or as soon as practicable following the Closing, deliver to
each holder of Company Shares (or to a person appointed by the holder in
writing in accordance with, or as otherwise provided by, Section 1.5 of the
Acquisition Agreement) a certificate representing the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder as determined in accordance
with Section 3.1.



   4.2 | Distribution with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates 
---|--- 
 

The former holders of Company Shares and Company Options shall not be entitled
to any interest, dividend, premium or other payment on or with respect to the

the shares of Parent Common Stock, in the case of Company Shares, or Parent
Replacement Options, in the case of Company Options, which they are
entitled to receive pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement.



 

Sched. A-5 ---|--- 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Company Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1 have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, one or more certificates representing one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1, deliverable in
accordance with Section 4.1. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom the payment is made
shall, as a condition precedent to the delivery thereof indemnify the Parent
in a manner satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



   4.4 | Extinction of Rights 
---|--- 

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares that was transferred or was deemed to have been
transferred pursuant to Section 3.1 that has not been deposited with the
Company (or, in the case of a lost certificate, such documentation as is
required in Section 4.3 has not been deposited with the Company) on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date shall cease to represent a claim
or interest of any kind or nature to the shares of Parent Common Stock. On
such date, the shares of Parent Common Stock (and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) to which the former holder of the
certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately
entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to
Parent, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions, cash and
interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. Neither of Company or
Parent nor any of their respective successors shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or distributions) delivered
to a public official pursuant to and in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 



   4.5 | Withholding Rights 
---|--- 
 

Parent will be entitled to withhold from any consideration otherwise payable
to any Company Shareholder under this Plan of Arrangement such amounts as are
required to be withheld under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) or the _Taxation
Act_ (Quebec), as provided for and in accordance with the terms of Section 1.6
of the Acquisition Agreement.

shares of Total Parent Common Stock after the foregoing allocations of Parent
Common Stock to the holders of Company Preferred Shares, on a pro rata basis
based on the number of Company Common Shares held by each such holder. 



 

Sched. A-8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Aggregate Value is less than the Gross
Preference Amount, then all shares of Parent Common Stock distributable to
the holders of Company Preferred Shares shall be distributed on a _pari passu_

B Convertible Preferred Shares and Class C Convertible Preferred Shares in
proportion to the Per Share Preference Amounts associated with such shares.

Parent Common Stock times (ii) the Weighted Average Share Price.

" _Excess Shares_ " means the lesser of (i) 3,600,000 shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock obtained by
(A) subtracting the Gross Preference Amount from the Aggregate Value and (B)
dividing the remainder (or "0" if such remainder is a negative number) by the
Weighted Average Share Price.

" _Gross Preference Amount_ " means $77,043,476.00.

 

" _Per Share Preference Amount_ " means (i) for the Class A Convertible
Preferred Shares, the Class A Per Share Preference Amount, (ii) for the Class

Closing Date (adjusted, as appropriate, for any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction that
may occur with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Closing).
