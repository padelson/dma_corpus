to such Preemptive Offeree, the purchase price therefor and the other material
terms of the proposed Issuance shall be adjusted accordingly to preserve the

counsel to the indemnified party a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, to

such action or proceeding include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and if in the opinion of outside counsel to the indemnified
party there may be legal defenses available to such indemnified party and/or
other indemnified parties which are different from or in addition to those
available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall
have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action or proceeding
on behalf of such indemnified party or parties, provided, however, that the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay for only one counsel and one local
counsel for all indemnified parties. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and
approval by the indemnified party of such counsel, the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation (unless the first proviso in the preceding
sentence shall be applicable). No indemnifying party shall be liable for any
settlement of any action or proceeding effected without its written consent.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable to an indemnified
party under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage
or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in lieu of the amount
paid or payable under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;hereof, the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;hereof shall contribute to
the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating the same), (i)&nbsp;in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand, and the indemnified party on the other,
which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect
thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such
loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by
clause (i)&nbsp;above is not permitted by applicable law or if the allocation
provided in this clause (ii)&nbsp;provides a greater amount to the indemnified party
than clause (i)&nbsp;above, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect
not only the relative fault but also the relative benefits received by the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party from the offering of the
securities covered by such registration statement as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.6(d) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentence of this Section&nbsp;2.6(d). No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, no Person shall be obligated to
contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any settlement of any action or
claim effected without such Person&#146;s consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (d)&nbsp;to the
contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the proceeds (net of expenses and
underwriting discounts and commissions) received by such party from the sale of
the Registrable Securities in the offering to which the losses, claims, damages
or liabilities of the indemnified parties relate.

appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and the Holders with
respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under
any federal, state or blue sky law or regulation of any governmental authority
other than the Securities Act. The indemnification agreements contained in
this Section&nbsp;2.6 shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or
contribution which any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract
and shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive
the transfer of any of the Registrable Securities by a Holder.
