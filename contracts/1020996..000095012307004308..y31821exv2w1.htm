RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have unanimously approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _ _Merger__ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have unanimously approved and declared advisable this Agreement;

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall 

   ##### 

  

 

continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The

Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the second business day (the " _ _Closing Date__ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of New York. 

   

 1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Delaware Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ "). 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_ 
  _of the Surviving Corporation_   

  

 2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Merger except that Article I thereof shall read "The name of the Corporation is Vertrue Incorporated" and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Charter__ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. 

   

 2.2. _The By-laws_. The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _By-__ _ _laws__ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. 

    ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Officers and Directors_

 3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be elected or otherwise validly appointed as the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-laws. 

   

 3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-laws. 

   

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_ 
  _Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

   

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _ _Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn or lost appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive (subject to applicable withholding tax pursuant to Section 4.2(g)) $48.50 per Share in cash, without interest (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each certificate formerly representing Shares owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share referred to in Sections 4.1(a)(i) and 4.1(a)(ii) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject, as applicable, to the right of each Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(ii) to receive the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f). 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, at Parents discretion. To the extent that the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace, restore or increase, as applicable, the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments under Section 4.1(a). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax 

  ##### 

  

   

withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Stockholders. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve (if required) any withdrawal of any such demands. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall (i) be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_. (a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Company Option__ ") under the Stock Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

   

 (b) _Restricted Share_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock (each, a " _ _Restricted Share__ ") under the Stock Plans, shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of such Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the executive officer development and compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions to implement the provisions of Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b). 

   

 4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

   

ARTICLE V

 5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this Section 5.1 to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys and its Significant Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date hereof, and each as so made available is in effect on the date hereof.

Adverse Effect__ " means a material adverse effect on (x) the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) the ability
of the Company to timely perform its obligations under, and consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
determination of whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect
under clause (x) above shall not take into account any effect to the extent
resulting from: 

    

 (A) changes after the date hereof in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States or other countries in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conduct operations or that are the result of acts of war or terrorism; 

   

 (B) changes after the date hereof that are the result of factors generally affecting any industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate; 

   

 (C) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened adverse change in, the relationship of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with its customers, employees, financing sources or suppliers caused by the announcement or pendency thereafter of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any litigation or other proceeding arising therefrom, any change in the Companys credit ratings ( _provided_ that this credit rating exception shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, circumstance or development underlying such change in credit ratings has resulted in, or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect); 

   

 (D) any actions taken by the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to obtain approval under applicable antitrust or competition laws for consummation of the Merger;

or contributed to, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

 

Unless, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (E), such changes
have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to other companies in the same
industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate. 

   

 (b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 80,000,000 Shares, of which 9,713,309 Shares were outstanding as of the close of business on March 20, 2007, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, none of which were outstanding as of the date hereof. Since the close of business on March 20, 2007, the Company has not issued any Shares other than the issuance of Shares upon the exercise of Company Options outstanding, the settlement of Restricted Share and conversion of the 5.50% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 (the " _ _Convertible Notes__ "), and has not issued or granted any options, restricted stock, warrants or rights or entered into any other agreements or commitments to issue any Shares and has not split, combined or reclassified any of its shares of capital stock.

Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of options, restricted stock and stock purchase rights outstanding under the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant, term, number of Shares and, where applicable, exercise price. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except as set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter and expect for shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, redeem or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments directly or indirectly based (in whole or in part) on the price or value of its capital stock and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. Except for the Convertible
Notes, the Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of the Company on any matter. There are no voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of
the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company shall include any Subsidiary of the Company of which all of the
shares of capital stock (other than director qualifying shares) of such
Subsidiary are owned by the Company (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company). 

    

 (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. 

   

 (i) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.2(k) are true and correct, the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ "), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles (the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception__ ").

It is agreed and understood that such opinions are for the benefit of the Companys board of directors and the special committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub. Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.2(k) are true and correct, the board of directors of the Company 

   ##### 

  

   

has (x) taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested
stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _ _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or, (C) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), a violation of any Laws to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material

Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the
Change of Recommendation Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith

 (f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement only and shall not be construed to grant any rights, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, to any person who is not a party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise to limit the right of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to amend, modify or terminate any such employee benefit plan, nor shall this Section 6.9 be construed to limit the right of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to terminate any employees employment or, except as specifically provided herein, to modify the terms and conditions of any employees employment.

 6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries in their capacity as such and not as stockholders or option holders of the Company (collectively, the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ ", and individually, an " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Indemnified Parties at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries in each case at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall also pay expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A and Side B coverage parts (directors and officers liability) of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall be no breach of this provision so long as the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, 

    ##### 

 

  

retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided

_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. 

   

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.11. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts (which are disclosed in Section 6.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter) or Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree that all provisions relating to exculpation, advancement of expenses and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of an Indemnified Part as provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as of the date hereof, shall remain in full force and effect for a six-year period beginning at the Effective Time. 

   

 6.12. _Takeover Statutes_.

    ##### 

  

    

proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Financing Commitment ( _provided_ that Parent and
Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof,
or otherwise so long as the terms would not adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Debt Financing Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment (including by consummating the financing
pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitments), (iii) enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Financing Commitments or on other terms acceptable to
Parent that would not adversely impact the ability or likelihood of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. If any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms that are not materially less beneficial to Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company than those in the Debt Financing Commitment in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any
party to the Financing Commitments, of which Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware, or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide copies of all documents
related to the Debt Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to
confidentiality agreements) to the Company. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Financing, including execution and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with bank information memoranda, (iii) executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or documents (other than legal opinions) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and (iv) furnish Parent and Merger Sub with financial and other pertinent information regarding the   ##### 

  

  

  

Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. 

   

 (c) Parent acknowledges and agrees (i) that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditional upon the receipt by Parent of the proceeds of the Financing Commitments and (ii) that any failure by Parent to have available, on the second business day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,  _provided_ that the Companys officers certificates referenced in Sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) would otherwise be able to be delivered if the Closing were to occur on such second business date) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with the Agreement, all funds necessary to consummate the Merger shall constitute a breach by Parent of this Agreement. 

   

 6.15. _Treatment of Senior Notes_. (a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to commence, promptly after the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so and the receipt of the Offer Documents from Parent, an offer to purchase and related consent solicitation with respect to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys outstanding 9-1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (collectively, the " _ _Senior Notes__ ") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent (collectively, the " _ _Debt Offer__ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and otherwise in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations and the Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offer until the No-Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offer. With respect to the Senior Notes, if requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Offer (or in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Senior Notes indenture, as amended or supplemented (the " _ _Senior Notes Indenture__ "), take actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the satisfaction and/or discharge and/or defeasance of such Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, and shall repurchase or satisfy and/or discharge and/or defeasance, as applicable, such Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture at the Effective Time, _provided_  that to the extent that any action described in the foregoing clause can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, it will be so conditioned, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to take any of the actions described in the foregoing clause that cannot be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, unless prior to or concurrently with taking such action, Parent shall irrevocably deposit, or shall cause to be irrevocably deposited with the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture sufficient funds to effect such repurchase or satisfaction or 

    ##### 

  

    

discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any
of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the Merger shall have
been consummated and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation of
the Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not,
without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer
or make any changes to the Debt Offer other than as agreed between Parent and
the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the
Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries need make any change to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Offers requested by Parent that decreases
the price per Senior Note payable in the Debt Offers or related consent
solicitation or imposes conditions to the Debt Offers or related
consent solicitation that are adverse to the holders of the Senior Notes, in
each case, if the making of any such change by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries would (i) breach any of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries obligations under, or violate any provision of, the Senior Notes
Indenture and other documents governing the Senior Notes or (ii) violate any
applicable Law, unless such change is previously approved by the Company in
writing. 

   

 (b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute a supplemental indenture to the Senior Notes Indenture, which supplemental indenture shall implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents (collectively, the " _ _Offer Documents__ ") and shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Offer). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Senior Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the Debt Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. 

   

 (c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer, including the Offer Documents. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer Documents ( _provided_ that the Companys and its Subsidiaries cooperation shall be limited to matters that Parent cannot accomplish without additional cost or delay without the assistance of the Company or its Subsidiaries). The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection with the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Offer any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light 

    ##### 

  

    

of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared
by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the holders of the Senior Notes (which
supplement or amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of
Parent, take the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15, the Company
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such
laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Offer and such compliance
will not be deemed a breach hereof. 

   

 (d) In connection with the Debt Offer, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the Debt Offers promptly following the incurrence thereof. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, for and against any loss or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Offers (other than arising from information provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries that was materially incomplete or inaccurate). 

   

 6.16. _Convertible Notes_. The Company shall (i) take all necessary action to enter into a supplemental indenture prior to the Effective Time with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, pursuant to the indenture dated as of September 30, 2003 (the " _ _Convertible Notes Indenture__ ") for the Convertible Notes to provide that on and after the Effective Time the Convertible Notes will be convertible only into cash in an amount equal to the amount that the holders of the Convertible Notes would be entitled to receive in the Merger if they had validly converted their Convertible Notes into Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 9.4 of the Convertible Notes Indenture; (ii) in accordance with Section 9.6 of the Convertible Notes Indenture, cause to be filed with the Conversion Agent and the Trustee (each as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) and cause to be given to the holders of the Convertible Notes, the notice required by such section at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) in accordance with Section 5.1(c) of the Convertible Notes Indenture, deliver to the Trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that the Merger and the supplemental indenture referred to in clause (i) of this Section 6.16 comply with Article 5 of the Convertible Notes Indenture and that all conditions precedent set forth in the Convertible Notes Indenture relating to the Merger have been satisfied. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.17. _Rule 16b-3_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (i) after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders, or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to (x) with respect to any termination pursuant to Section 8.2(b), the date of the Stockholders Meeting at which the vote on the Merger is held, (y) with respect to any termination pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the Termination Date and (z) with respect to any termination pursuant to clause (B) below, such breach by the Company) and thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) or (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) as a result of a willful and material breach by the Company of any of its agreements set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.14(b), 6.15 and/or 6.16 of this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or is terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) when otherwise terminated; or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a); 

 

then the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) days
after the date of such termination) pay Parent the Termination Fee (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to
clause (iii) of this Section 8.5(b) shall be paid as set forth in Section
6.2(f) payable by wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that no Termination Fee shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of
this paragraph (b) unless and until within twelve (12) months of such
termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have consummated an
Acquisition Proposal (substituting "25%" for "15%" in the definition
thereof)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event that the Termination
Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section
8.5(b), the Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries Representatives with respect to any
and all breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
this Agreement or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 

    ##### 

  

    

(other than a willful and material breach by the Company of Sections 6.1,
6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.14(b), 6.15 and/or 6.16). For purposes of
this Agreement, " _ _Termination Fee__ " means (i) $17,500,000, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated by (A) the Company pursuant to Section
8.3(a) and the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
an Excluded Party during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending
on the No-Shop Period Start Date or (B) Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) in a
circumstance in which the event giving rise to the right of termination is
(x) a Change of Recommendation, (y) the recommendation by the board of
directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company of an Acquisition
Proposal other than the Merger or (z) the failure of the board of directors of
the Company to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
each having occurred during the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the No-Shop Period Start Date in response to a Superior Proposal by
an Excluded Party received during such period, and (ii) $22,500,000 in
all other circumstances. 

   

 (c) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(c), Parent shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of such termination) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to $17,500,000 (the " _ _Parent Fee__ "). Parents payment in full of the Parent Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for damages against Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors and their respective Representatives with respect to the breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event the Parent Fee becomes payable and is paid, or caused to be paid by Parent, pursuant to this Section 8.5(c), the Parent Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in no event, whether or not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of $17.5 million in the aggregate, less the amount of any Parent Fee paid, if applicable, for all losses and damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the sum of Parents Expenses, not to exceed $4 million in the aggregate. " _Expenses_ " include all documented reasonable and actual out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of financing sources, counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf and payable by Parent in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement. Payment of Parents Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.5(d) shall be made no later than five (5) business days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment after such termination and a documented itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all such Expenses (which itemization may be supplemented and updated from time to time by Parent until the ninetieth day after such 

    ##### 

  

    

termination, _provided_ that payment of such supplemented amount shall be
made no later than five (5) business days after delivery to the Company of
such supplemented notice). In the event that the Termination Fee subsequently
becomes payable, the amount of the Termination Fee shall be reduced by the
amount of expenses previously and actually paid by the Company to Parent
pursuant to this Section 8.5(d). 

   

 (e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or 8.5(d) or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(b) or 8.5(d) or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance
with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any

 9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub when due. 

   

 9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 

   

 9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

   

 9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." 

   

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. 

   

 9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation, _provided_ that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. 

   

 9.15. _Restructuring_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Closing, Merger Sub may merge with and into Parent, with Parent as the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Structural Merger__ ") in which event the parties hereto agree to amend this Agreement to reflect that the Merger shall be effected by a direct merger of Parent, as the surviving corporation of the Structural Merger, with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, _provided_ that the provisions of this Agreement, and the rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall otherwise remain unmodified and in full force and effect. 

    ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written above.
