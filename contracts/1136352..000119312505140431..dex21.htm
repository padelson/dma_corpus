of assets and liabilities contained in the methodology contained in the
adjusted balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2004 attached as
Exhibit 2.3(a), which includes, among others, the following adjustments: (i)
cash and cash equivalents will not be included as an asset of the Companies,
(ii) all Indebtedness (including all accrued interest expense) will be
excluded as a liability of the Companies, (iii) any changes to current assets
and liabilities resulting from a reclassification of any non-current assets
and liabilities will not be included as an asset or liability of the
Companies, (iv) all accounts or obligations (including accounts receivable
and accounts payable) between or among the Companies, the parties to this
Agreement, the parties to the Settlement Agreement, any Seller Related Party,
or any of their respective Affiliates will not be included as an asset or

sheet, the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). If the total current assets
minus the total current liabilities shown on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet (the " _Actual Working Capital_ ") is less than $0.00 (the " _Minimum
Working Capital Amount_ "), Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy shall (in the
same proportion as their respective payments in Section 2.2(a))
promptly remit cash to Inergy Acquisition and Inergy Storage in the amount of
such shortfall (in the same proportion as their respective payments in Section
2.2(a)). If the Actual Working Capital is greater than the Minimum Working
Capital Amount, Inergy Acquisition and Inergy Storage shall (in the same
proportion as their respective payments in Section 2.2(a)) promptly remit cash
to Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy (to be shared in the same proportion as

(b) The Purchasers shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet to review, at their expense, the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, together with the workpapers used in the preparation thereof.
Stagecoach I will grant to the Purchasers and their authorized
representatives reasonable access to all relevant books and records and
employees of Stagecoach I and the Companies to the extent reasonably required
to complete such review. If the Purchasers object to any item in the Closing
Date Balance Sheet within thirty (30) days following its delivery, by written
notice to Stagecoach I specifying the Purchasers objections in reasonable
detail and the basis therefor, and if Stagecoach I does not agree with
the objections of the Purchasers,  



 

16 Stagecoach I and the Purchasers, within thirty (30) days following such notice
of objection (the " _Resolution Period_ "), will attempt to resolve their
differences, and any resolution by them (evidenced in writing), as to any
disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive. If at the conclusion
of the Resolution Period any items remain in dispute, such disputed items
will be submitted to KPMG LLP, or if KPMG LLP refuses to accept such
engagement, to a firm of independent certified public accountants recognized
within the United States of America (the " _Neutral Auditors_ ") selected by
the Purchasers and Stagecoach I within ten (10) days after the expiration of
the Resolution Period. If the Purchasers and Stagecoach I are unable to agree
on the Neutral Auditors, an accounting firm recognized within the United
States will be selected by lot from two (2) names submitted by the Purchasers
and two (2) names submitted by Stagecoach I, none of which are then engaged by
the Purchasers, the MLP, the Sellers, the Companies, the eCORP Seller
Guarantors, Highstar or any Seller Related Party. The Neutral Auditors will
act as an arbitrator to determine and resolve, based solely on presentations
by the Purchasers and Stagecoach I, and not by independent review, only those
issues still in dispute. The Neutral Auditors determination will be made
within thirty (30) days of their selection, will be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Purchasers and Stagecoach I and will be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The Purchasers and Stagecoach I
agree to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable
engagement letter. All fees and disbursements of the Neutral Auditors will be
paid one-half by Inergy Acquisition and Inergy Storage (with the one-
half that is the responsibility of Inergy Acquisition and Inergy Storage
being divided between them in the same proportion as their respective payments
in Section 2.2(a)) and one-half by Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy (with
the one-half that is the responsibility of Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy
being divided between them in the same proportion as their respective payments
in Section 2.2(a)).



(c) After the Closing, the Purchasers will cause CNYOG to continue to seek a
resolution of the NYSEG Dispute in a commercially reasonable manner.
Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy may appoint legal counsel to monitor the
resolution of the NYSEG Dispute, with the costs and expenses of such legal
counsel to be paid by Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy. CNYOG may not enter
into any settlement or compromise of the NYSEG Dispute without the consent of
Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy (such consent not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld). Within ten days after the final resolution
of the NYSEG Dispute, the Purchasers shall remit to Stagecoach I and
Stagecoach Energy an amount (with such amount being divided between them in
the same proportion as their respective payments in Section 2.2(a)) equal to
(A) minus (B), where (A) equals the amount of the "previous balances,"
arrearages and late charges of the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation
that were included as liabilities of the Companies in the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and (B) equals the amount owed by CNYOG to the New York State Electric
and Gas Corporation up to but not including the Closing Date as a result of the
final resolution of the NYSEG Dispute (including any interest, penalties and
late charges).



Section 2.4. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price, adjusted to
reflect the amount of liabilities assumed and the portion of the Purchase
Price characterized as interest for federal income tax purposes, shall for all
Tax purposes be allocated among the Purchased Assets  



 

17 in the manner set forth in Schedule 2.4. The Purchasers and the Sellers shall
cooperate with each other in meeting the requirements of Code Section 1060,
shall, to the extent required, timely complete and file the statement required
by IRS Form 8594 consistent with such allocation, shall provide a copy of such
form to the other party hereto and shall file a copy of such form with their
federal income Returns for the period that includes the Closing Date. The
Purchasers and the Sellers will not take any position inconsistent with any
such allocation on any Return unless otherwise required by a
final determination applicable to the relevant Tax jurisdiction resulting
from an audit, subsequent proceedings or the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. All Tax positions taken on the basis of Schedule 2.4
shall be modified as appropriate in accordance with this Section 2.4 to
reflect any adjustments in the Purchase Price made following the Closing Date
in accordance with this Agreement, including adjustments made pursuant to
Section 11.10.



Section 2.5. _Escrow_. At the Closing, the Purchasers and the Sellers will
enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit 2.5. The parties acknowledge that the purpose of the
escrow is to serve as a reserve against breaches of representations,
warranties and covenants made herein and as security for performance of
indemnity obligations of the Sellers and the eCORP Seller Guarantors contained
herein. However, nothing contained in the escrow agreement will be considered
as limiting or be deemed to limit the liability of the Sellers, the eCORP
Seller Guarantors or Highstar for a breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant made herein to the funds escrowed under Section 2.2(b)(ii).



Section 2.6. _Closing_. Subject to each partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Article XII, the purchase and sale referred to in
Section 2.1 (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Stinson
Morrison Hecker LLP, 1201 Walnut Street, Kansas City, Missouri on the later of

CNYOG or Marketing, as applicable, has good and marketable title to all the

by the Contracts and Other Agreements described on Schedules 5.7(c)-A and

or event of default thereunder, all rentals and other payments due in respect

have performed all other conditions necessary to keep such interests in full
force and effect. No portion of the Leased Real Property is subject to any
Lien or other restriction or condition of any nature that renders it

currently conducted or proposed to be conducted. To Stagecoach Is and
Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, (i) no party to any Lease is in breach of or
default under and (ii) (A) no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would and (B) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement would not, constitute a breach or default or
permit termination, modification or acceleration under any Lease, except
for such breaches, defaults or events as to which requisite waivers have
been, or prior to the Closing will have been, obtained and are in full force
and effect. Stagecoach I has made available to the Purchasers a correct and
complete copy of each Lease, including all amendments, waivers and
modifications thereof.

32 Section 5.15. _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) _Identification of Plans_. Except for the arrangements set forth in
Schedule 5.15, no Company now maintains or contributes to, or has any
outstanding liability to or in respect of or obligation under, any pension,
profit-sharing, deferred compensation, bonus, option, appreciation
right, severance, group or individual health, dental, medical, life
insurance, survivor benefit, or similar plan, policy or arrangement, whether
formal or informal, for the benefit of any director or manager, officer,
consultant, employee or Deemed Employee, whether active or terminated, of
such Company. Each of the arrangements set forth in Schedule 5.15 is herein
referred to as an " _Employee Benefit Plan_." Stagecoach I has delivered or
made available to the Purchasers true and correct copies of each Employee
Benefit Plan, and with respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan (i) any
associated trust, custodial, insurance or service agreements, (ii) any annual
report, actuarial report or disclosure materials (including specifically any
summary plan descriptions) submitted to any Governmental Authority or
distributed to participants or beneficiaries thereunder in the current or any
of the three (3) preceding calendar years, and (iii) the most recently
received Internal Revenue Service determination letters and any governmental
advisory opinions, rulings, compliance statements, closing agreements, or
similar materials specific to such Employee Benefit Plan.



(b) _Compliance with Terms and Law_. Each Employee Benefit Plan is and has
been maintained and operated in compliance with the terms of such Employee
Benefit Plan and with the requirements prescribed (whether as a matter of
substantive Law or as necessary to secure favorable Tax treatment) by any and
all Laws in effect from time to time, including ERISA and the Code, and
applicable to such Plan, except where noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to have a Project Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust
or other entity intended to qualify as a "voluntary employee benefit
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and
associated with any Employee Benefit Plan, is expressly identified as such in
Schedule 5.15 and has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service and nothing has occurred that has resulted or is likely to
result in the revocation of such determination or that requires or could
require action under the compliance resolution programs of the Internal
Revenue Service to preserve such qualification.



(c) _Funding of Certain Plans_. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan for
which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full
payment has been made of all amounts that each Company, and with respect to
the Deemed Employees, each of the Employee Leasing Companies, is required,
under the terms of each such Employee Benefit Plan, to have paid
as contributions to that Employee Benefit Plan, as applied through the
Closing Date, and no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 302
of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan.



(d) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result, by itself or in combination in any other
event (regardless of whether that other event has occurred or will occur), in
any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former director or officer, consultant or employee of any Company
or result in the vesting, acceleration of payment or increases in the amount
of any benefit payable to or in respect of any such current or former
director or manager, officer, consultant or employee.



 

33 (e) No Employee Benefit Plan is a multi-employer plan.



(f) For purposes of this Section 5.15, "multi-employer plan," "party in
interest," "current value," "accrued benefit," "reportable event," and
"benefit liability" have the same meanings assigned to such terms under
Sections 3, 4043(b) or 4001(a) of ERISA, and "ERISA affiliate" means any
entity that under Section 414 of the Code is treated as a single employer with
any Company.

secrets, processes, formulas, techniques, and unregistered copyrights used in
or necessary to any Companys business, " _Proprietary Information_ "). Each
Company owns or has a valid license to use all Proprietary Information.



(b) In any instance where any Companys rights to Proprietary Information
arise under a license or similar agreement (other than for "off-the-shelf"
software programs that have not been customized for its use), this is
indicated in Schedule 5.16 and such rights are or were, as the case may be,
licensed exclusively to it except as indicated in Schedule 5.16. To
Stagecoach Is and Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, none of the Proprietary
Information owned by the Companies is being infringed by others, or is subject
to any outstanding order, decree, judgment or stipulation. Each Company
maintains reasonable security measures for the preservation of the secrecy and
proprietary nature of all Proprietary Information.



(c) (i) To Stagecoach Is or Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, no Company, nor
any of the employees of any Company, has infringed or made unlawful use of,
or is infringing or making unlawful use of, any proprietary or confidential
information of any Person, including any former employer of any past or
present employee or consultant of any Company; and (ii) to Stagecoach Is and
Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, the activities of the employees of any Company
in connection with their employment does not violate and has not violated any
agreements or arrangements that any such employees or consultants have
with any former employer or any other Person, except where such infringement,
unlawful use or violation would not reasonably be expected to have a Project
Material Adverse Effect.



(d) To Stagecoach Is and Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, the use of the

intellectual property rights of any kind and nature worldwide, and none of the

are, and at all times since the respective dates set forth in Schedule 5.17
have been, in full force and effect, are or were sufficient for compliance in
all material respects by each Company with all Contracts and Other Agreements
to which any Company is a party, and provide that they will remain in full
force and effect through the Closing Date, whereupon they shall be terminated
with any refund of premiums accruing to Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy
(to be shared in the same proportion as their respective payments in Section
2.2(a)). No Company is in default in any material respect with respect to its
obligations under any of such insurance policies, or has received any written
or, to Stagecoach Is and Stagecoach Energys Knowledge, oral notification of
cancellation of any such insurance policies.



Section 5.18. _Employment of Officers, Employees_. All of the individuals
performing services to or on behalf of the Companies are treated as employees
of one or more of the Employee Leasing Companies and CNYOG. A copy of all
written Contracts and Other Agreements involving any Company and any Employee

HSR Act.



(b) Each of the Sellers and the Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. If
any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
the Sellers and the Purchasers shall cooperate to contest and resist any such
Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing all commercially reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial

43 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.5 requires the

the Sellers in writing as to which of the field operators performing services
at the Phase I Facilities to or on behalf of the Companies, the Purchasers, or
their Affiliate, would like to extend offers of employment. Each offer of
employment to a field operator must include a base salary no less than the
base salary of such field operator on the date of the Closing. Each field
operator who accepts such offer and becomes employed by the Purchasers or
their Affiliates is referred to as a " _Continuing Employee_ ". Continuing
Employees will have the right to participate in any and all of the Purchasers
or a Purchasers Affiliates benefit plans to the same extent as any similarly
situated employee of the Purchasers,  _provided_ that the Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be covered under a group
medical plan of the Purchasers or one of their Affiliates effective on the
Closing Date. The Purchasers will recognize, or will cause their appropriate
benefit plan to recognize, (i) for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductibles during the period beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on the
Closing Date, any payment made by any Continuing Employee towards the
satisfaction of any deductibles (a term that, for this purpose, will not
include any out-of-pocket maximums) in any benefit plan and (ii) for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (other
than for benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) of Continuing
Employees, all service with the Companies. None of the Purchasers or their
Affiliates group medical plans will recognize any payment made by any
Continuing Employee under any of the Sellers or their Affiliates medical
plans for purposes of the Continuing Employees out-of-pocket maximum under
the Purchasers or their Affiliates medical plan. The Purchasers agree that
their health and welfare plans in which Continuing Employees participate on
and after Closing will, to the extent required by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was waived under applicable
health and welfare plans offered to the Continuing Employees by the
Companies) and any proof of insurability for such Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents.



 

44 (b) Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy shall (in accordance with their
respective ownership percentages in the Companies) remain responsible for any
severance benefits, termination indemnity payments or similar payments, if
any, owed to any individual who is not extended an offer of employment with
the Purchasers or an Affiliate of the Purchasers as provided in Section
7.6(a) or who is extended an offer of employment but does not accept such
offer.



(c) The Sellers (or an Affiliate of the Sellers) shall be responsible for
payment of medical and dental claims incurred by Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Seller or Sellers Affiliate sponsored plan. Effective
as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, all Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) shall cease to be covered by the Sellers, or one
of the Sellers Affiliates Employee Benefit Plans, including plans, programs,
policies and arrangements that provide medical and dental coverage, life
and accident insurance, disability coverage, and vacation and severance pay.
The Purchasers (or an Affiliate of the Purchasers) shall be responsible for
payment of medical and dental claims incurred by Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) on or after the Closing Date in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Purchasers- or Purchasers Affiliate-sponsored
plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall be responsible for
providing any Seller employee or employee of one of the Sellers Affiliates
who loses coverage under a group health care plan sponsored by a Seller or one
of the Sellers Affiliates, including an individual who loses coverage in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, the election
of group health coverage to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code
and any applicable state Laws mandating health insurance continuation coverage
(" _Continuation Coverage_ ") under the terms of the health plans maintained
by a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Purchasers or an Affiliate of the Purchasers shall perform the duties required
of a successor employer with respect to Continuation Coverage, including
making such coverage available to Continuing Employees upon their termination
of employment with the Purchasers or an Affiliate of the Purchasers on or
after the Closing Date, or to other qualified beneficiaries whose
qualifying event occurs on or after the Closing Date, to the extent required
by Law.

Closing Date, (i) the Company Guaranty and any liabilities related thereto
shall be released as to Stagecoach I, and (ii) substitute arrangements, if
necessary, of the Purchasers or their Affiliates are in effect. If requested
by the Sellers, the Purchasers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, at
the Closing, execute and deliver an assumption of the Company Guaranty in the
form attached as Exhibit 7.8.



Section 7.9. _Delivery of Books and Records_. Promptly after the Closing, the
Sellers will deliver to the Purchasers (i) all records relating to
the design, drilling, development,  



 

45 construction or operation of the Phase I Facilities or Phase II, including all

maps, archeological and geological data (including the archeological and
geological data listed on Schedule 7.9), structure maps, drilling records,

that are in their possession or under their control, or in the possession or
control of eCORP or its Affiliates or contractors with respect to
the analysis, design, drilling, development, construction or operation of the
Phase I Facilities or Phase II or the real property interests owned or
otherwise held by the Companies or Stagecoach II (the " _Technical Records_ ")
and (ii) all business records and other data and information (in whatever
form maintained, including hardcopy form or electronic form and information
known by any Continuing Employee) including administrative records, financial
records, minute books, policy files, sales records, employee files, files and
records relating to regulatory matters and accounting records in the
possession or control of the Sellers or eCORP or its Affiliates or contractors
with respect to the Companies or Stagecoach II (the " _Business Records_ "
and, together with the Technical Records, the " _Books and Records_ "). The
Purchasers and the Companies shall have the full and unrestricted right to use
any and all information contained in or discernable from the Books and
Records and no provision of this Agreement shall restrict such rights.



Section 7.10. _Preservation of Companies  Books and Records by the
Purchasers_. The Purchasers shall, from and after the Closing Date,
preserve all significant books and records of the Companies relating to the
Companies and their business and operations prior to the Closing Date for a
seven (7) year period, and, thereafter, not destroy or dispose of or allow the
destruction or disposition of such books and records without first having
offered in writing to deliver such books and records to Stagecoach I at
Stagecoach Is expense. If Stagecoach I fails to request such books and
records within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice described in the
preceding sentence, the Purchasers may dispose of such books and records.



Section 7.11. _Consent to Use of Financial Statements_. The Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, without the payment of money, to obtain the
consent of the accountants preparing the financial statements described in
Section 5.5 to use such financial statements in connection with public or
private debt or equity financings of the Purchasers or their Affiliates or
other documents filed by the Purchasers or their Affiliates with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other Governmental Authority. In
addition, the Sellers will not object to the use of such financial statements.



Section 7.12. _Purchaser Guaranty_. As the indirect owner of all of
the equity interest in the Purchasers and in consideration of the direct and
indirect benefits to be realized by the MLP, the MLP hereby unconditionally
and absolutely guarantees to the Sellers the performance by the Purchasers of
all of the terms, covenants, conditions, duties and obligations contained in
this Agreement (including the prompt payment of any amounts to be paid by the
Purchasers under this Agreement). This is an absolute and unconditional
guaranty of payment and performance and may be proceeded upon by the Sellers
before taking any action against the Purchasers or after action against the
Purchasers has been commenced. The obligations of the MLP under this Section
7.12 will not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure
of the Sellers to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under
this Agreement, by any waiver, modification, or amendment of any provision
hereof, by any default, failure, or delay, willful or  



 

46 otherwise, in the payment or performance by the Purchasers of amounts payable
or performance required under this Agreement, or by any other act or thing or
omission or delay to do any other act or thing that may or might in any manner
or to any extent vary the risk of the MLP or to otherwise operate as a
discharge of the MLP as a matter of Law. Except with respect to those claims
for indemnification asserted under Article XI (including any claims relating
to Tax matters covered under Section 11.3(b)) on or before the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date that have been guaranteed by the MLP
under this Section 7.12, the MLPs guarantee under this Section 7.12 shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect after the fourth anniversary of
the Closing Date.



Section 7.13. _Seller Guaranty_.



(a) _Phase I Guaranty_. If the Closing occurs, then:



(i) Highstar, as a direct owner of a portion of the equity interests in
Stagecoach I and in consideration of the direct and indirect benefits to be
received by Highstar, hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees to the
Purchasers (A) fifty percent (50%) of each payment obligation of Stagecoach I
and Stagecoach Energy under Section 11.2(a) and (B) Highstars proportionate
share of the remittance of any decrease in the Stagecoach I Purchase Price
under Section 2.3, with such proportionate share to be determined as set forth
on Schedule 7.13(a). This is an absolute and unconditional guaranty of
payment only and may be proceeded upon by the Purchasers before taking any
action against Stagecoach I, Stagecoach Energy or any eCORP Seller Guarantor
or after action against Stagecoach I, Stagecoach Energy or any eCORP Seller
Guarantor has been commenced. The obligations of Highstar pursuant to this
Section 7.13(a)(i) will not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by
the failure of the Purchasers to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
remedy under this Agreement, by any waiver, modification or amendment of any
provision hereof, by any default, failure, or delay, willful or otherwise, in
the payment or performance by Stagecoach I or Stagecoach Energy of amounts
payable or performance required under this Agreement, or by any other act or
thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing that would operate as
a discharge of the eCORP Seller Guarantors or Highstar as a matter of Law.
Except with respect to those claims for indemnification asserted under
Article XI (including any claims relating to Tax matters covered under Section
11.2(a)(ii)) on or before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date that have
been guaranteed by Highstar under this Section 7.13(a)(i), Highstars
guarantee under this Section 7.13(a)(i) shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date.



(ii) The eCORP Seller Guarantors, as direct or indirect owners of a portion
of the equity interests in each of Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy and in
consideration of the direct and indirect benefits to be received by each of
the eCORP Seller Guarantors, hereby, jointly and severally,
unconditionally and absolutely guarantee to the Purchasers (A) fifty percent
(50%) of each payment obligation of Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy under
Section 11.2(a) and  



 

47 (B) the eCORP Seller Guarantors proportionate share of the remittance of any
decrease in the Stagecoach I Purchase Price under Section 2.3, with such
proportionate share to be determined as set forth on Schedule 7.13(a). This is
an absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and may be
proceeded upon by the Purchasers before taking any action against Stagecoach
I, Stagecoach Energy, any eCORP Seller Guarantor or Highstar or after action
against Stagecoach I, Stagecoach Energy, any eCORP Seller Guarantor or
Highstar has been commenced. The obligations of the eCORP Seller Guarantors
pursuant to this Section 7.13(a)(ii) will not be discharged or impaired or
otherwise affected by the failure of the Purchasers to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, by any waiver,
modification or amendment of any provision hereof, by any default, failure,
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance by Stagecoach I
or Stagecoach Energy of amounts payable or performance required under this
Agreement, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other
act or thing that would operate as a discharge of the eCORP Seller Guarantors
or Highstar as a matter of Law. Except with respect to those claims for
indemnification asserted under Article XI (including any claims relating to
Tax matters covered under Section 11.2(a)(ii)) on or before the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date that have been guaranteed by the eCORP Seller
Guarantors under this Section 7.13(a)(ii), the eCORP Seller
Guarantors guarantee under this Section 7.13(a)(ii) shall terminate and be
of no further force or effect after the fourth anniversary of the Closing
Date.



(b) _Phase II Guaranty_. If the Closing occurs, the eCORP Seller Guarantors,
as the direct and indirect owners of a portion of the equity interests in the
Sellers and in consideration of the direct and indirect benefits to be
received by the eCORP Seller Guarantors, hereby, jointly and severally,
unconditionally and absolutely guarantee to the Purchasers the full and
timely payment and performance by Stagecoach II of all of the terms,
covenants, conditions, duties and obligations contained in this Agreement
(including the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of Stagecoach II set forth in this Agreement and
those covenants contained in Article VII (to the extent that such covenants
relate to the sale and purchase of the Stagecoach II Assets)). This is an
absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and may be
proceeded upon by the Purchasers before taking any action against Stagecoach
II or any eCORP Seller Guarantor or after action against Stagecoach II or any
eCORP Seller Guarantor has been commenced. The obligations of the
eCORP Seller Guarantors under this Section 7.13(b) will not be discharged or
impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Purchasers to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, by any waiver,
modification or amendment of any provision hereof, by any default, failure,
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance by Stagecoach II
of amounts payable or performance required under this Agreement, or by any
other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing that may
or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the eCORP Seller
Guarantors or to otherwise operate as a discharge of the eCORP Seller
Guarantors as a matter of Law. Except with respect to those claims for
indemnification asserted under Article XI (including any claims relating to
Tax matters covered under  



 

48 Section 11.2(b)(ii)) on or before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date
that have been guaranteed by the eCORP Seller Guarantors under this Section
7.13(b), the eCORP Seller Guarantors guarantee under this Section 7.13(b)
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect after the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date.



Section 7.14. _Satisfaction of Liabilities_.



(a) On the Closing Date:



(i) Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy will obtain releases of all Liens on
the Stagecoach I Assets, with the result being that the Stagecoach I Assets
will be held on the Closing Date by Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy, and
transferred to Inergy Acquisition and Inergy Storage, free and clear of all
Liens and without any restrictions on transferability except for those
conditions or restrictions on transferability imposed by Law;



(ii) Stagecoach II will obtain releases of all Liens other than those
Permitted Liens on the Stagecoach II Assets that are not required to be

(iii) Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy will (and will cause the Companies
to) obtain releases of all Liens, other than those Permitted Liens that are
not required to be discharged and released on the Closing Date and those Liens
subject to a bond as provided in Section 7.18, on all of the assets of the
Companies, with the result being that such assets will be held on the
Closing Date by the Companies free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens that are not required to be discharged and paid at Closing and

(iv) Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy will (and will cause the Companies to)
satisfy in full from the proceeds of the Stagecoach I Purchase Price all
Indebtedness of the Companies and all Capital Leases.

of their debts and liabilities (including those arising in connection with
the termination of the Contracts and Other Agreements listed on Schedule
9.11(d)) to (A) the other parties to the Settlement Agreement (except as
provided in Section 9.11), (B) the Seller Related Parties and (C) all of
their respective Affiliates.



(b) After the Closing, 



(i) Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy will satisfy in full and discharge, as
and when due, all of their debts, liabilities and performance obligations
(including under any Contracts and Other Agreements) existing or arising on or
prior to the Closing (whether known, unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise); and  



 

49 (ii) Stagecoach II will satisfy in full and discharge, as and when due, all of
its debts, liabilities and performance obligations (including under any
Contracts and Other Agreements) existing or arising on or prior to the Closing

Section 7.15. _Names_. The Sellers agree that among the assets being acquired
by the Purchasers are all of the Sellers right, title and interest, if any,
with regard to the name or mark "Stagecoach." Promptly following the Closing,
each Seller will change its limited liability company name, and cause each of
its Affiliates and all Seller Related Parties to do the same, and adopt new
names that do not include the term "Stagecoach." The Sellers and their
Affiliates reserve the right to make nominal uses of the term
"Stagecoach" (including the right to use the term "Stagecoach" on any of the
Sellers websites to refer to past projects and for Permits and regulatory-
related material, filings and applications). Except for the foregoing, the
Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates and all Seller Related Parties
to, refrain from making any use of the name or mark "Stagecoach" from and
after the Closing Date, and the Sellers will execute any one or more
assignments, bills of sale or other documents that may from time to time be
reasonably requested by the Purchasers in order to evidence the transfer and
assignment of such name and mark. The Purchasers will change the name of
Marketing to eliminate the name or mark "eCORP" within a reasonable period of
time after the Closing.



Section 7.16. _Continuity_. For a period of at least one year following the
Closing Date, each Seller will take all steps necessary to preserve and
continue its existence as a limited liability company.



Section 7.17. _Confidentiality_.



(a) For a period of two years from and after the Closing, the Sellers and
Highstar shall cause all data or information at any time received by or made
available to any Seller, Highstar, any of their Affiliates or their respective
representatives from or by the Purchasers, their Affiliates or
their respective representatives regarding the Purchasers or their respective
businesses, operations, financial conditions or prospects (any of the
foregoing, " _Purchaser Information_ "), to be maintained by the Sellers,
Highstar and each of their Affiliates and their respective representatives in
confidence, not to be utilized for any purpose (except, pending Closing, to
prepare therefor) and not to be disclosed for any purpose.



(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing (or, if this Agreement
is earlier terminated, then until two years after the date of such
termination), the Purchasers shall cause all data or information at any time
received by or made available to the Purchasers, their Affiliates or their
respective representatives from or by the Sellers, Highstar and each of their
Affiliates or their respective representatives regarding the Sellers, Highstar
or each of their businesses, operations, financial conditions or prospects
(any of the foregoing, " _Seller Information_ "), to be maintained by the
Purchasers, their Affiliates and their respective representatives in
confidence, not to be utilized for any purposes (except pending Closing, to
prepare therefor) and not to be disclosed for any purpose.  



 

50 (c) The Purchasers, the Sellers and Highstar acknowledge that the approvals of
the Governmental Authorities that are required in Article IX or X of this
Agreement may necessitate the provision of Seller Information or Purchaser
Information to Governmental Authorities in proceedings to obtain such
approvals.



(d) Other than as provided in Section 7.17(c) and with respect to the
obligations under Sections 7.17(a) and 7.17(b), if the party receiving
Confidential Information (the " _Receiving Party_ ") is requested by any
Governmental Authority to disclose any Confidential Information of
another party (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), the Receiving Party shall give
the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such requirement and will provide the
Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so
that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order. If the
Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory,
request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall
give the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such requirement so that the
Disclosing Party may attempt to seek such a protective order or other
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such portion of
such Confidential Information as may be required to be disclosed (and the
Receiving Party shall cooperate reasonably with any such efforts by the
Disclosing Party, but at the cost and expense of the Disclosing Party) or
waive compliance with the terms of this Section 7.17. If such protective
order or other remedy is not timely obtained, the Receiving Party agrees to
give the Disclosing Party notice of the Confidential Information to be
disclosed as far in advance of such disclosure as is reasonably practicable,
and shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information for which
the Disclosing Party has waived compliance with the relevant provisions of
this Section 7.17, or that is, in the opinion of the Receiving Partys legal
counsel, required to be disclosed in order to avoid a contempt order or other
civil or criminal sanction or penalty. For purposes of this Section 7.17, "
_Confidential Information_ " means, with respect to the Sellers, Highstar and
each of their Affiliates and their respective representatives, Purchaser
Information, and with respect to the Purchasers, their Affiliates and their
respective representatives, Seller Information.



(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality obligations set forth
in this Section 7.17 do not apply to any disclosure of information:



(i) that at the time of disclosure is already in the public domain through no
fault of the applicable parties, their Affiliates or their respective
representatives;



(ii) that after disclosure becomes part of the public domain through no act
or fault of the applicable parties or their Affiliates or their respective
representatives;



 

51 (iii) if such information subsequently becomes known to the applicable parties
or their Affiliates on a non-confidential basis through no breach of their
obligations hereunder and from a source other than the parties hereto or their
Affiliates or their advisers, _provided_ that, to the knowledge of such party,
such source is not bound by any agreement to keep such information
confidential or, to the knowledge of such party, is otherwise prohibited from
transmitting the information to any party hereto or their Affiliates by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; 



(iv) that is independently developed by the applicable parties or their
Affiliates through no breach of their obligations hereunder; or



(v) required by Law or stock exchange rules; _provided_ that the applicable
parties shall comply with Section 7.17(d) to protect any such information.



Section 7.18. _Bonds_. The parties acknowledge that because of certain
unresolved disputes, the Persons listed on Schedule 5.7(b) (including
PPPSNCLStagecoach Joint Venture and SNCLavalin Corporation) have filed Liens
against the Owned Real Property. On or before the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall, at their option (i) deliver to the Purchasers certificates evidencing
one or more surety bonds sufficient to release or bond over such Liens in
accordance with New York Law, with such bonds to be in form and substance and
in amount reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers, or (ii) discharge by
payment any such Lien and deliver to the Purchasers evidence of such discharge
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers.



Section 7.19. _Marketing Agreement_. The Sellers shall cause Marketing to not
exercise the recall right set forth in Section 2.6 of the Marketing Agreement.



Section 7.20. _Notice of Seller Breach_. The Sellers shall give prompt notice
(each notice, a " _Breach Notice_ ") to the Purchasers of (a) the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event, change, effect or development of which the
Sellers obtain Knowledge the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause
or would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
Sellers contained in this Agreement to be untrue or incorrect in any material
respect on or prior to the Closing Date and (b) any failure of the Sellers,
the eCORP Seller Guarantors or Highstar to perform or comply with any
agreement, obligation, covenant or condition to be performed or complied
with by any of them under this Agreement. Each Breach Notice must include a
reasonably detailed description of the event, change, effect, development or
failure disclosed in the Breach Notice. The delivery of a Breach Notice will
not be deemed to (A) modify any representation or warranty hereunder, (B)
modify any condition set forth in Article IX, or (C) except as provided in the
next sentence or Section 7.21, limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Purchasers. If the Closing occurs, then the event,
change, effect, development or failure disclosed in the Breach Notice will be
deemed waived by the Purchasers and the Purchasers may not make a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise as a result of the event,
change, effect, development or failure disclosed in a Breach Notice.



 

52 Section 7.21. _Actual Knowledge of Seller Breach_. If the Closing occurs, then
any material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant (including a
covenant contained in Section 7.20) or agreement will be deemed waived by the
Purchasers and the Purchasers may not make a claim for indemnification under
this Agreement or otherwise as a result of the material breach if, at the
time of the Closing, David G. Dehaemers, Jr. or William R. Moler had actual

ARTICLE VIII.

TAX MATTERS



Section 8.1. _Tax Returns; Obligation to Prepare and File Returns_.



(a) Subject to Section 8.2(c), Stagecoach I shall have the exclusive authority
and obligation to prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Returns of the Companies, including income tax returns, that are
due with respect to any taxable year or other taxable period ending prior to
the Closing Date. In addition, Stagecoach I shall have the exclusive
authority and obligation to prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, the income tax returns of the Companies for the stub period
beginning on January 1, 2005 and continuing up to and including the Closing
Date (the " _Stub Period Income Tax Returns_ "). Such authority includes the
determination of the manner in which any items of income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit arising out of the income, properties and operations of
the Companies are reported or disclosed on such Returns. Stagecoach I shall
pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown or required to be shown to be due on
such Returns.



(b) Except with respect to the Stub Period Income Tax Returns, on and after
the Closing Date the Purchasers shall have the exclusive authority and
obligation to prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Returns of the Companies, including income tax returns, that are
due with respect to any taxable year or other taxable period ending on or
after the Closing Date. Such authority includes the determination of the
manner in which any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit arising
out of the income, properties and operations of the Companies are reported
or disclosed on such Returns. Subject to Section 8.1(c), the Purchasers shall
pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown or required to be shown to be due on
such Returns.



(c) Except with respect to the Stub Period Income Tax Returns, the Purchasers
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on or with respect to
Returns of each Company for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date
(a  



 

53 " _Straddle Period_ "). Except with respect to the Stub Period Income Tax
Returns, the Purchasers shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes owed by each
Company for all taxable periods beginning on or after the Closing Date.



(i) The Purchasers shall deliver to Stagecoach I copies of any Return for any
Straddle Period that the Purchasers are obligated to prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 8.1(b) no later than 15
Business Days before filing for approval by Stagecoach I, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that Stagecoach I will
not be deemed to have unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed such
consent if Stagecoach I requests a review by an independent accounting firm as
provided in Section 8.1(c)(ii). Any such Return shall be accompanied by a
calculation by the Purchasers pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.1(c)(iii) of the amount of the Taxes shown on such Return that are
attributable to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period (the " _Pre-
Closing Straddle Period_ ") and copies of any workpapers necessary to verify
the computations of the Tax shown to be due on the Return and the calculation
of the Tax allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period. Except as set forth
in Section 8.1(c)(ii), no later than one Business Day prior to the due date of
any such Return, Stagecoach I shall pay to the Purchasers by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Purchasers an
amount equal to the amount of Taxes of the Companies attributable to the Pre-
Closing Straddle Period to the extent, if any, that such amount exceeds the
sum of any estimated payments, deposits or credits made or applied to or by a
taxing authority for the account of the Companies prior to the Closing Date.
The Purchasers shall pay to Stagecoach I (which shall be solely responsible
for paying to Stagecoach Energy its proportionate share) the amount, if any,
by which the sum of any estimated payments, deposits or credits made or
applied to or by a taxing authority for the account of the Companies prior to
the Closing Date exceeds the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period.



(ii) If Stagecoach I disagrees with the calculation of the Tax allocable to
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, it shall (A) notify the Purchasers of the
disagreement, (B) provide reasonably specific details relating to the basis
for the disagreement, (C) request that such calculation be reviewed by
an independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to both Stagecoach I and
the Purchasers and (D) pay to the Purchasers the amount of the Tax not in
dispute. If Stagecoach I makes such a request, Stagecoach I and the Purchasers
shall cooperate in a commercially reasonably manner in selecting the
independent accounting firm reviewer and shall then cooperate in a
commercially reasonably manner with the independent accounting firm so that it
can complete its review and render its decision as soon as reasonably
practicable. Stagecoach Is obligation to pay the disputed portion of the
Taxes will be deferred until five Business Days after the independent
accounting firm renders its decision. If the review is not completed and
payment made within twenty-five Business Days after the Business Day prior to
the due date of such Return, the payment, as calculated by the independent
accounting firm, shall bear interest at the annual rate of 6% from the
Business  



 

54 Day prior to the due date of such Return. The decision of the independent
accounting firm shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.
Stagecoach I and the Purchasers shall each bear one-half of the fees and
expenses of the independent accounting firm.



(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period:



(A) All _ad valorem_ and property Taxes of a Company and any other periodic
Taxes of a Company that are not based on income, net revenues or receipts
(excluding sales and use and payroll Taxes), shall be allocated between the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the post-Closing portion of the Straddle
Period based on the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the number of days in the entire Tax period; and



(B) Taxes of a Company for the Pre-Closing Straddle Period that are based on
income, net revenues or receipts and sales and use and payroll Taxes will be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the effective time of the
Closing, and such Taxes shall be computed by determining the items of income,
expense, deduction, loss or credit on a "closing of the books" basis as of the
effective time of the Closing.



Section 8.2. _Controversies_.



(a) The Purchasers and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Returns pursuant to Section 8.1 and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Companies. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
preparation and filing and to any audit, litigation or other proceeding
relating thereto and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.



(b) Notwithstanding Article XI, except with respect to Taxes relating to or
arising out of _ad valorem_ Taxes or property Taxes, the Sellers shall be
solely responsible for defending any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of any Seller or the Companies attributable to any Tax
period ending prior to the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Pre-Closing
Period_ ") or relating to the Stub Period Income Tax Returns, and shall have,
subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2(b), the exclusive authority to
conduct, negotiate, compromise and settle any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding. The Purchasers shall give the Sellers prompt notice of the
commencement of any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding of which they
become aware and, at the Sellers request at any time and from time to time,
any powers of attorney or other authorizations necessary or appropriate to
give effect to the foregoing. The Sellers shall keep the Purchasers reasonably
informed as to the progress of any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of the Companies, and shall, if the Purchasers so  



 

55 request in writing, permit the Purchasers at their expense to participate in
any such audit, litigation or other proceeding solely insofar as it relates
to the Companies; _provided_ that the Sellers shall not settle any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding insofar as it relates to the Companies without
the Purchasers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such settlement would increase the Tax liabilities of the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates (including the Companies) for any period
on or after the Closing Date.



(c) With respect to Taxes relating to or arising out of  _ad valorem_ Taxes
or property Taxes, the Purchasers shall be solely responsible for defending
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Companies attributable to any Pre-Closing Period, and shall have the
exclusive authority, at their sole cost and expense, to conduct, negotiate,
compromise and settle any such audit, litigation or other proceeding.



(d) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) and subject to
Section 8.3, following the Closing Date the Purchasers shall have the sole
right to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority, initiate
any claim for refund or amend any Return, and contest, resolve and defend
against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or
other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, the income, assets or
operations of the Companies.



(e) Any Tax refund (other than with respect to Taxes relating to or arising
out of _ad valorem_ Taxes or property Taxes) that is received by the
Companies (including any interest or penalties thereon) in cash from a taxing
authority or otherwise credited to the Companies against payments due by the
Companies to that taxing authority on or after the Closing Date (including
any interest received with respect thereto) relating to (i) Pre-Closing
Periods or Pre-Closing Straddle Periods, or (ii) Taxes paid prior to the
Closing Date, shall be the property of the Sellers and the Purchasers shall
pay promptly such amounts over to Stagecoach I (which shall be solely
responsible for paying to Stagecoach Energy its proportionate share). If
requested by the Sellers (which request must provide reasonably specific
instructions regarding the requested actions to be taken), the Purchasers
shall cause, at the sole cost and expense of the Sellers, the Companies to
file for and use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite
the receipt of any cash refund to which the Sellers are entitled under this
Section 8.2(e).



(f) Any Tax refund received by or credited to a Company on or after the date
of this Agreement (including any interest or penalties thereon) relating to or
arising out of _ad valorem_ Taxes or property Taxes (whether relating to Pre-
Closing Periods, Pre-Closing Straddle Periods or otherwise) shall be the
property of the Purchasers. However, if any direct or indirect owner of a
Seller is required by the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to repay
in cash any Qualified Empire Zone Enterprise credits attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period that were properly taken by such Person, which repayment is
required as a result of the decrease in _ad valorem_ Taxes or property Taxes
owed by CNYOG as a result of the administrative and judicial proceedings
described in Section 5.10(i), the Purchasers will promptly reimburse such
Person an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of such repayment and
(ii) the amount of cash actually  



 

56 received by CNYOG from the appropriate taxing authority as a result of such
decrease in _ad valorem_  Taxes or property Taxes; _provided, however,_ that
in order to receive such reimbursement by the Purchasers, such Person must
agree in writing to (A) grant to the Purchasers the exclusive authority to
conduct, negotiate, compromise and settle any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to the Qualified Empire Zone Enterprise credits that
were taken by such Person and (B) fully cooperate with the Purchasers with
respect to any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to the
Qualified Empire Zone Enterprise credits that were taken by such Person.



Section 8.3. _Amended Returns_. The Purchasers shall not file or cause to be
filed any amended Return or claims for refund with respect to any Pre-Closing
Period or any Straddle Period that would increase the Sellers liability for
Taxes without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 8.4. _Prior Tax Agreements_. Effective as of the Closing, this
Agreement terminates and supersedes any and all Tax sharing,
allocation, indemnification or similar agreements, arrangements or
undertakings in effect on the Closing Date between or among any of the
Sellers, any predecessor or Affiliate thereof or any Seller Related Party, on
the one hand, and any of the Companies, on the other hand, for all Taxes
imposed by any Government Authority, regardless of the period in which such
Taxes are imposed.



Section 8.5. _Non Foreign Person Affidavit_. The Sellers shall furnish to the
Purchasers on or before the Closing Date a non-foreign person affidavit as
required by Section 1445 of the Code.



Section 8.6.  _Post-Closing Access and Cooperation_. From and after the
Closing Date, the Purchasers agree, and agree to cause both of the Companies,
to permit Stagecoach I or the Sellers representative to have reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books
and records of such Company, to the extent that such books and records relate
to a Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period, and personnel of the
Purchasers and such Company, for the purpose of enabling Stagecoach I to: (i)
prepare the Returns specified in Section 8.1(a); (ii) investigate or contest
any Tax matter that Stagecoach I has the authority to conduct under Section
8.2; and (iii) evaluate any claim for indemnification under Section
11.2(a)(iii) and, if Stagecoach I elects to assume the defense thereof, to
defend the same.



Section 8.7. _Expenses_. Each party, at its own expense, shall file, to the
extent required by applicable Law, all necessary Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer or sales and use Taxes
relating to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets. The Purchasers
shall pay any such Taxes in accordance with Section 13.1.



Section 8.8. _754 Election_. The Sellers will cause CNYOG to make an election
under Section 754 of the Code (and comparable election, if provided for, under
applicable state or local Laws) to adjust the basis of the assets of the
Companies in accordance with Section 743 of the Code in the Stub Period Income
Tax Returns.

survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the period contemplated in Section 11.4.



Section 11.2. _Indemnification Obligations of the Sellers_.

 



(a) _Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy_. Each of Stagecoach I and Stagecoach
Energy agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchasers, their Affiliates (including the Companies after the Closing)
and their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees,
representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ")
from any Environmental Claims, damages, losses, liabilities, obligations,
claims, demands, settlements, judgments of any kind, interest or
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Loss_ "),
suffered, incurred or paid as a result of:



(i) The failure of any representation or warranty made by either Stagecoach I
or Stagecoach Energy in Articles III or V of this Agreement to be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date;



(ii) Any failure to perform any covenant or agreement made or undertaken by
Stagecoach I or Stagecoach Energy in this Agreement (including those in
Article VIII) or in any certificate or other document delivered by Stagecoach
I or Stagecoach Energy to the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement;



(iii) All Taxes imposed on or asserted against the properties, income or
operations of the Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods and any Pre-Closing
Straddle Period (it being understood that Stagecoach Is and Stagecoach
Energys obligations under this Section 11.2(a)(iii) shall not be duplicative
of their obligations under Article VIII and Section 11.2(a)(i) and shall
be determined consistently with Article VIII). The Purchasers shall promptly
give Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy written notice of any claim made by
any taxing authority (a " _Tax Claim_ ") that the Purchasers have
reasonably determined may give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Section 11.2(a)(iii), including a computation of the amount of the claimed
indemnification with sufficient detail and particularity to enable Stagecoach
I and Stagecoach Energy to reasonably determine the amount of such required
indemnification. If the Purchasers fail to notify Stagecoach I or Stagecoach
Energy with respect to a Tax matter in accordance with Section 8.2(a), the
Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees under
this Section 11.2(a)(iii) to the extent that such failure to notify the
Sellers adversely affects the Sellers ability to defend against such
contested Tax Claim and then only to the extent of such economic prejudice;



 

62 (iv) (A) The presence of Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum on any
Property of either Company in violation of applicable Environmental Law
resulting from a Release where the presence of such Hazardous Substances, oil,
gas or petroleum is caused by the acts or omissions of any Person while either
Company owned, controlled or had rights in or to the Property, including the
extent to which such Release continues after Closing, (B) the presence of
Hazardous Substances, oil or petroleum on any other property in violation of
applicable Environmental Law resulting from a Release where the presence of
such Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum arises out of the transport,
disposal, treatment, arrangement for disposal or treatment, or arrangement for
transport for disposal or treatment by Stagecoach I, Stagecoach Energy or
either Company before the Closing, including the extent to which such Release
continues after Closing, (C) any Environmental Claim based on or arising out
of the conduct of Stagecoach I or Stagecoach Energy, either Company, any of
their respective Affiliates or any Seller Related Party before the Closing, or
(D) any non-compliance by Stagecoach I or Stagecoach Energy or either Company
with any applicable Environmental Law or Permit before the Closing; and



(v) The Phase I Retained Liabilities (which, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing but for the purpose of avoiding any doubt, such Phase I
Retained Liabilities shall be the sole responsibility of the Sellers and the
Purchasers shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless from any
Loss relating thereto).



(b) _Stagecoach II_. Stagecoach II agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from any Loss suffered, incurred or paid as

date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date;



(ii) Any failure to perform any covenant or agreement made or undertaken by

certificate or other document delivered to the Purchasers by Stagecoach II
pursuant to this Agreement;



(iii) All Taxes imposed on or asserted against the properties, income or
operations of Stagecoach II or the Stagecoach II Assets for all Pre-Closing
Periods and any Pre-Closing Straddle Period (it being understood that
Stagecoach IIs obligations under this Section 11.2(b)(iii) shall not be
duplicative of its obligations under Article VIII and Section 11.2(b)(i) and
shall be determined consistently with Article VIII). The Purchasers shall
promptly give Stagecoach II written notice of any Tax Claim that the
Purchasers have reasonably determined



 

63 may give rise to a right of indemnification under this Section 11.2(b)(iii),
including a computation of the amount of the claimed indemnification with
sufficient detail and particularity to enable Stagecoach II to reasonably
determine the amount of such required indemnification. If the Purchasers fail
to notify Stagecoach II with respect to a Tax matter in accordance with
Section 8.2(a), Stagecoach II shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees under this Section 11.2(b)(iii) to the extent that such
failure to notify Stagecoach II adversely affects Stagecoach IIs ability to
defend against such contested Tax Claim and then only to the extent of such
economic prejudice;



(iv) (A) The presence of Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum on any
Property of Stagecoach II or any Property associated with the Stagecoach II
Assets in violation of applicable Environmental Law resulting from a Release
where the presence of such Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum is
caused by the acts or omissions of any Person while Stagecoach II owned,
controlled or had rights in or to the Property, including the extent to which
such Release continues after Closing, (B) the presence of Hazardous
Substances, oil or petroleum on any other property in violation of applicable
Environmental Law resulting from a Release where the presence of such
Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum arises out of the transport,
disposal, treatment, arrangement for disposal or treatment, or arrangement for
transport for disposal or treatment by Stagecoach II before the Closing,
including the extent to which such Release continues after Closing, (C) any
Environmental Claim based on or arising out of the conduct of Stagecoach II,
any of its Affiliates or any Seller Related Party before the Closing, or (D)
any non-compliance by Stagecoach II with any applicable Environmental Law or
Permit before the Closing; and



(v) The Phase II Retained Liabilities (which, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing but for the purpose of avoiding any doubt, such Phase II
Retained Liabilities shall be the sole responsibility of the Sellers and the
Purchasers shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless from any Loss
relating thereto).



Section 11.3. _Indemnification Obligations of the Purchasers_. The Purchasers,
jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of

result of:



(a) The failure of any representation or warranty made by the Purchasers in
Article VI of this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as of the

Property of the Companies or any Property associated with the Stagecoach II
Assets in violation of applicable Environmental Law resulting from a Release

caused by the acts or omissions of any Person occurring after the Closing,
(ii) the presence of Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum on any other
property in violation of applicable Environmental Law resulting from a Release
where the presence of such Hazardous Substances, oil, gas or petroleum arises
out of the transport, disposal, treatment, arrangement for disposal or
treatment, or arrangement for transport for disposal of treatment by any of
the Purchasers or any Company after the Closing, (iii) any
Environmental Claim based on the conduct of any of the Purchasers, any
Company or any of their respective Affiliates occurring after the Closing, and

applicable Environmental Law or Permit occurring after the Closing; and



(d) The Assumed Liabilities.

terminate as follows:

claim shall continue to survive beyond the Claims Period and shall remain a
basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed
of in accordance with the terms hereof.

66 such Seller Losses exceeds $2,000,000, in which event the Purchasers shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees only for Seller Losses in excess of such
amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
with respect to Losses that arise out of or relate to the representations or
warranties in Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.5.



(d) The indemnity obligations of Stagecoach I and Stagecoach Energy pursuant
to Section 11.2(a)(i) shall be limited in the aggregate to $25,500,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply with

warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.10, 5.25 or 5.27, which

Section 11.6. _Third Party Claims_. If any Action (including any Action set
forth in Schedules 3.5 or 5.11) is asserted or instigated by a third party
(each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against any Person entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.2 or 11.3 (an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), and in respect of which such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity under this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify
the party obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, through
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party and its
counsel to participate in such settlement or defense, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified
Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such
Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle
any such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of  



 

67 the Indemnified Partys notice of a Third Party Claim of indemnity hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Third Party Claim but
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this
Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not except with the consent of all
other Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified
Party shall not except with the consent of all of the Indemnifying Parties,
(in each case such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld), enter into any settlement or compromise of any Action, or admit to
any liability with respect to any Indemnifying or Indemnified Party, or
consent to entry of any judgment that does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such Third Party
Claim of an unconditional release of all Indemnifying Parties and Indemnified
Parties from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim.



Section 11.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. With the exception of any claims based on
fraud or willful misconduct, the Sellers and the Purchasers agree that the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article XI shall, after the
Closing, be the exclusive remedy for any breach of the covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. IN NO EVENT WILL
ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS ASSERTED BASED ON TORT OR CONTRACT THEORIES; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the case of Third Party Claims the damages and Loss to
be covered by the indemnification provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
to include all forms of relief, monetary and otherwise, asserted therein,
without any of the foregoing exceptions. The Purchasers and the Sellers
expressly waive any claims against each other and release each other from any
liability they may have to each other pursuant to any Environmental Laws
except for those provided for under this Agreement.



Section 11.8. _Subrogation_. Nothing in this Agreement may be construed to
limit any subrogation rights, if any, that an Indemnifying Party may have at
law or equity to the extent the Indemnifying Party has made payments to the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XI.



Section 11.9. _Losses Net of Insurance_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article XI will be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with
respect to such Loss.



Section 11.10. _Indemnity Payments as Purchase Price Adjustments_. To the
greatest extent possible all indemnity payments under Article VIII and this
Article XI will be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price paid by the
Purchasers hereunder.



ARTICLE XII.

Section 12.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be terminated or abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing:



(a) by mutual written consent of the Sellers, on the one hand, and of the
Purchasers, on the other hand;



 

68 (b) by the Sellers or by the Purchasers if the Closing has not occurred on or
prior to August 1, 2005 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that if
the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Termination Date as a result
of the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 9.4 or 10.4 in
connection with the HSR Act, the Termination Date will be extended to August
31, 2005; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 12.1(b) is not available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement or breach of a representation or
warranty is the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date; and



(c) by the Sellers or by the Purchasers, if any Law or regulation of any
Governmental Authority having proper jurisdiction thereover is enacted that
renders illegal or otherwise prohibits consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any
Governmental Authority having proper jurisdiction thereover that renders
illegal or otherwise prohibits such transactions is entered and such
judgment, injunction, order or decree becomes final and nonappealable
(provided that the terminating party must have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a stay, lifting, waiver or rescission of any such judgment,
injunction, order or decree).



Section 12.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1 by the Purchasers, on the one hand, or the
Sellers, on the other hand, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given
to the other party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall be terminated and there shall be
no liability hereunder on the part of the Purchasers or the Sellers, except
that the provisions of Sections 7.17, 11.7, 13.1, 13.2, 13.4, 13.5 and 13.12
shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 12.2
shall relieve any party of liability for breach of this Agreement or entitle
any party to claim any right to any special, consequential or punitive
damages and each party hereby expressly waives any right that it may have to
receive special, consequential or punitive damages.



ARTICLE XIII.

MISCELLANEOUS



Section 13.1. _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided herein, the parties
hereto shall pay all of their own expenses relating to the transactions

Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

of legal proceedings that may arise hereunder or under any of the other
documents entered into in connection herewith. The Sellers, the eCORP Seller
Guarantors, Highstar, the MLP and the Purchasers irrevocably waive, to the
