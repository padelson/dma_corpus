<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.1 <U>Sale and Transfer of Shares</U>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, good
and valid title to all the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for any Encumbrance
arising under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws, and Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept the Shares from Seller.

this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and
delivery to Buyer of the Shares, Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount in cash equal to the
sum of $287,000,000 (the <B>&#147;Purchase Price&#148;</B>), as adjusted upward or downward pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3,
which shall be paid to Seller at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with instructions delivered by Seller to Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment following the Closing
pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.4.

(the <B>&#147;Estimated Adjustment Schedule&#148;</B>) setting forth Seller&#146;s calculation of its good faith estimate
of the Working Capital Assets less the Working Capital Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the
<B>&#147;Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount&#148;</B>) based on the most recently available unaudited
month-end consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries regularly prepared

$50,000,000, then the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount shall not be reduced. If the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated Adjustment Schedule (i)

Schedule&#148;</B>) setting forth Buyer&#146;s calculation of (i)&nbsp;the Working Capital Assets and the Working
Capital Liabilities, in each case as of the Closing Date (the <B>&#147;Proposed Closing Date Working

Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount (such
proposed upward or downward adjustment is hereinafter referred to as the <B>&#147;Proposed Final Adjustment
Amount Due&#148;</B>). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of computing the Final Closing Date Working
Capital Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount Due, no cap or limitation on the upward or downward
adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price in respect of the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due,
shall apply. Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Buyer and its Representatives in order to

Adjustment Amount Due, and Seller and its representatives shall have the right to perform
reasonable procedures necessary to verify accuracy thereof.

its and the Company&#146;s and the Company Subsidiaries&#146; personnel and accountants available to Seller
and its accountants and other representative to discuss any such information, data or work papers.
Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within twenty days following delivery of the Buyer Adjustment
Schedule (the <B>&#147;Dispute Period&#148;</B>) that (i)&nbsp;Seller agrees with the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and the
Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due (an <B>&#147;Approval Notice&#148;</B>) or (ii)&nbsp;Seller disagrees with such
calculations, identifying with reasonable detail the items with which Seller disagrees (a <B>&#147;Dispute

to the national office of Ernst &#038; Young LLP (the <B>&#147;Independent Accountant&#148;</B>), which firm shall
