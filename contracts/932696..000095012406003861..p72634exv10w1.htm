STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of July 20, 2006, is made and entered into by and among INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and TECHNOLOGY SPECTRUM, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Seller"). 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent indirectly owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Seller and Software Spectrum, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"); 

   

 WHEREAS, Seller directly owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock (the "Shares") of the Company; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to enter in to this Agreement pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, Seller proposes to sell to Buyer, and Buyer proposes to purchase from Seller, the Shares; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 
 PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES 

   

 Section 1.1 _Sale and Transfer of Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, good and valid title to all the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for any Encumbrance arising under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept the Shares from Seller. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Consideration; Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery to Buyer of the Shares, Buyer shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount in cash equal to the sum of $287,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted upward or downward pursuant to Section 1.3, which shall be paid to Seller at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions delivered by Seller to Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be subject to further adjustment following the Closing pursuant to Section 1.4. 

   

 Section 1.3 _Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment_. Not more than five Business Days nor less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Estimated Adjustment Schedule") setting forth Sellers calculation of its good faith estimate of the Working Capital Assets less the Working Capital Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount") based on the most recently available unaudited month-end consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries regularly prepared by the Company under the Parents basis of presentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital 

    ##### 

  

 

Amount less the Companys cash and cash equivalents appearing on such most
recently available unaudited month-end consolidated balance sheet (the "Non-
Cash Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount") exceeds $50,000,000, the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount shall be reduced by the amount
that the Non-Cash Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount
exceeds $50,000,000. If the Non-Cash Estimated Closing Date Working Capital
Amount equals or is below $50,000,000, then the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital Amount shall not be reduced. If the Estimated Closing Date
Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated Adjustment Schedule
(i) exceeds zero, the Purchase Price payable to Seller at the Closing shall
be increased by an amount equal to such surplus, or (ii) is less than zero,
the Purchase Price payable to Seller at the Closing shall be decreased by an
amount equal to such deficiency (such upward or downward adjustment pursuant
to this Section 1.3 is hereinafter referred to as the "Estimated
Adjustment Amount Due"). 

   

 Section 1.4 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty five days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. Such balance sheet shall be accompanied by a schedule (the "Buyer Adjustment Schedule") setting forth Buyers calculation of (i) the Working Capital Assets and the Working Capital Liabilities, in each case as of the Closing Date (the "Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount"), and (ii) the amount by which the Purchase Price should be adjusted (A) upward to the extent that the Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount, and (B) downward to the extent that the Proposed Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount (such proposed upward or downward adjustment is hereinafter referred to as the "Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due"). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of computing the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount Due, no cap or limitation on the upward or downward adjustment, if any, to the Purchase Price in respect of the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due, shall apply. Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Buyer and its Representatives in order to facilitate preparation of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and determination of the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due, and Seller and its representatives shall have the right to perform reasonable procedures necessary to verify accuracy thereof. 

  

 (b) After receipt of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule, Seller may request, and Buyer will provide to Seller and its accountants and other representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to, or copies of, as Seller or such accountants and other representatives shall reasonably request, the information (including the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries), data and work papers used in connection with the preparation of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and to calculate the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due, and will make its and the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries personnel and accountants available to Seller and its accountants and other representative to discuss any such information, data or work papers. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within twenty days following delivery of the Buyer Adjustment Schedule (the "Dispute Period") that (i) Seller agrees with the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due (an "Approval Notice") or (ii) Seller disagrees with such calculations, identifying with reasonable detail the items with which Seller disagrees (a "Dispute Notice"). 

   ##### 

  

 

Upon receipt by Buyer of a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller will use good
faith efforts during the twenty day period following the date of Buyers
receipt of a Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period") to resolve any
differences they may have as to the calculations of the Buyer
Adjustment Schedule and/or the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due. If Buyer
and Seller cannot reach a written agreement during the Resolution Period,
within five days thereafter, their disagreements, limited to only those
issues still in dispute ("Remaining Disputes"), shall be promptly
submitted to the national office of Ernst and Young LLP (the "Independent
Accountant"), which firm shall conduct such additional review as is necessary
to resolve the specific Remaining Disputes referred to it. Seller and Buyer
will cooperate fully with the Independent Accountant to facilitate
its resolution of the Remaining Disputes, including by providing the
information, data and work papers used by each party (as applicable) to
calculate the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due and the Remaining
Disputes, making its personnel and accountants available to explain any such
information, data or work papers and submitting each of their calculations of
the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Final Adjustment Amount
Due. Based upon such review and other information, the Independent Accountant
shall determine the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Final
Adjustment Amount Due strictly in accordance with the calculation specified in
Section 1.3 of the Disclosure Schedule and, to the extent not specified
therein, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (the
"Independent Accountant Determination"). Such determination shall
be completed as promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty
days following the submission of the Remaining Disputes to the Independent
Accountant and shall be explained in reasonable detail and confirmed by the
Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on,
Seller and Buyer for purposes of this Section 1.4, except to correct manifest
clerical or mathematical errors. 

   

 (c) The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountant shall be apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the total dollar value of disputed exceptions resolved in favor of each such party, with each such party bearing such percentage of the fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountant as the aggregate disputed exceptions resolved against that party bears to the total dollar value of all disputed exceptions considered by the Independent Accountant. 

  

 (d) On the third Business Day after the earliest of (i) the receipt by Buyer of an Approval Notice, (ii) the expiration of the Dispute Period if Buyer has not received an Approval Notice or a Dispute Notice within such period, (iii) the resolution by Seller and Buyer of all differences regarding the Buyer Adjustment Schedule and the Proposed Final Adjustment Amount Due within the Resolution Period and (iv) if no payment is due under Section 1.4(e), the receipt of the Independent Accountant Determination, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall pay to the other any Final Adjustment Amount Due, plus interest calculated from the Closing Date through, but not including, the date of such payment at the Interest Rate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds without set-off or deduction of any kind. 

  

 (e) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, there are Remaining Disputes but the parties agree as to which party is to make the payment under Section 1.4(d), on the third Business Day after the end of the Resolution Period, such party shall pay to the other party the Final Adjustment Amount Due in the lowest amount that has been proposed by one of the parties (such lowest amount, the "Undisputed Adjustment Amount Due"), plus interest 

   ##### 

  

 

calculated from the Closing Date through, but not including, the date of such
payment, at the Interest Rate, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds without set-off or deduction of any kind. If an Undisputed Adjustment
Amount Due becomes payable, on the third Business Day after the receipt of
the Independent Accountant Determination, Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
shall pay to the other the excess, if any, of the Final Adjustment Amount Due
over the Undisputed Adjustment Amount Due, plus interest calculated from the
Closing Date through, but not including, the date of such payment at the
Interest Rate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds without set-
off or deduction of any kind. 

   

 For purposes of this Section 1.4, the following defined terms have the following meanings: 

  

 "Interest Rate" shall mean the rate per annum equal to (1) the LIBOR rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars for the three month-period commencing on the Closing Date, as such LIBOR rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 at approximately 11:00 am, London time, on the Closing Date plus (2) 1.5%; provided, however, that if prior to the date payment is to be made under Section 1.4(d) or 1.4(e), the party making such payment has materially breached its obligations under this Section 1.4 and as a result of such breach, such date of payment has been delayed, the Interest Rate shall instead be 15%. 

  

 "Final Adjustment Amount Due" shall mean, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4, the amount by which the Purchase Price shall be adjusted (A) upward to the extent that the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount and (B) downward to the extent that the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Amount. 

  

 "Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount" shall mean, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4, the amount of the Working Capital Assets and the Working Capital Liabilities, in each case as of the Closing Date. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 THE CLOSING 

   

 Section 2.1 _The Closing_. (a) The sale and transfer of the Shares by Seller to Buyer as contemplated hereby shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 300 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071 at 10:00 am (Los Angeles time) on the third Business Day following the satisfaction and/or waiver of all conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the waiver or fulfillment of those conditions), unless another date or place is agreed in writing by each of the parties hereto (the "Closing"). 

   

 (b) At the Closing: 

   

 (i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer one or more certificates representing all the issued and outstanding Shares, each such certificate to be duly and validly endorsed in favor of Buyer or accompanied by a separate stock power duly and validly executed by the Seller such that the sole legal and beneficial ownership of the Shares are vested in Buyer; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller cash in the amount of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.2. 

  

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER 

   

 Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Seller to Buyer simultaneously with the execution hereof, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date) that:

not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be
deemed equal to the amount which would by payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date, provided, that for purposes of this
sentence any transactions occurring in the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing shall be treated as having occurred on the day
after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 5.4(a), the provisions
of Section 8.4 shall apply. 

   

 (b) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date  Nonconsolidated Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are due to be filed after the Closing Date, other than Tax Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of Seller will include the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on each Tax Return that relates to a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date which is filed after the Closing Date prior to such filing, and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller. Buyer shall deliver to Seller completed drafts of all such Tax Returns at least thirty days prior to the filing thereof for Sellers review, comment and reasonable approval without undue delay. Seller shall pay to Buyer, within fifteen days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods, that amount equal to such Taxes of each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to such periods, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected or otherwise taken into account in determining the Final Closing Date Working Capital Amount. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date  Seller Consolidated Tax Returns_. For all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to join in any consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of Seller to the extent such Companies were included in such Tax Returns as a matter of past practice, and Seller shall pay any such Taxes attributable to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including without limitation, in the case of Seller consolidated federal income Tax Return, any intercompany items taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice. 

  

 (d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and timely notification of receipt of any notice of an Audit or notice of deficiency relating to any Tax or Tax Return with respect to which the non-recipient may have liability hereunder. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, (ii) give Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records, and (iii) make available to Seller all books and records as requested for use in any audit. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 

  

 (e) _Tax Proceedings_. If an audit, examination, litigation or claim is commenced by any Tax authority which may result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 5.4(a), Buyer shall promptly notify Parent of such audit or claim (a "Tax Proceeding"), stating the nature and basis of any such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve Parent from any liability which it may have on account of this indemnification or otherwise, unless the Parent is materially prejudiced thereby. Parent will have the right, at its option, upon timely notice to Buyer, to assume control or any defense of any Tax Proceeding with their own counsel. Parents right to control a Tax Proceeding will be limited to amounts in dispute which would be paid by Seller or Parent or for which Seller or Parent would be liable pursuant to Section 5.4(a). Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Parent in connection with any Tax Proceeding, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon Parents request, the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Proceeding, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder and providing Parent with any powers of attorney that would be necessary 

   ##### 

  

 

for Parent to assume the control or defense of any Tax Proceedings.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall neither consent nor agree (nor
cause the Company to consent or agree) to the settlement of any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any liability for Taxes that may adversely affect
the liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries for any tax not
otherwise indemnifiable under Section 5.4(a) without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and neither Parent, nor any of its Affiliates, shall file an
amended Tax Return that may adversely affect the liability for Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries that is not otherwise indemnifiable under
Section 5.4(a) without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (f) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") and costs incurred in connection with the payment thereof shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Transfer Taxes shall be timely paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by applicable law by the party ordinary required to pay such taxes and make such filings. The paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party. Upon payment of any such Transfer Tax, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed.

 (ii) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, (1) Buyer shall prepare a Form 8023 (with all attachments) and Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve such Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (or any comparable provisions of state and local tax law) or any successor provisions, and (2) Buyer shall determine the amount of the "adjusted gross-up basis" with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-5) and the allocations of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" among the relevant assets in accordance with Section 338(b)(5) of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder. Buyers determination shall be subject to Sellers reasonable review. In the event that the parties 

   ##### 

  

    

cannot agree on a mutually satisfactory allocation within thirty days after
the presentation of Buyers computations and allocations described in clause
(2), a mutually selected independent accounting firm shall, at Sellers and
Buyers joint expense, determine the appropriate allocation, which

None of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to return to Seller any refund attributable to any carrybacks described in Section 5.4(i). 

  

 (j) _Carrybacks_. To the extent that Buyer either chooses, or is required by Law, to carryback any operating losses, net operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items of any non-U.S. Company Subsidiary to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and/or a Straddle Period (including, without limitation, if such losses are required to be carried back prior to being carried forward), all relevant amended Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed promptly by the party responsible for filing such Tax Return, and any refund or credit attributable to such carryback shall be for the benefit of such Company Subsidiary, and, if received by Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary), the Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, shall promptly upon receipt remit such refund or the amount of such credit to the Company Subsidiary entitled thereto.

Parent and Seller shall take such action as is necessary such that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall cease being a "participating employer" and shall cease any co-sponsorship and participation in each Company Employee Plan that is jointly adopted, sponsored or maintained by Parent, Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary and in which any current, terminated or retired employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary participates (each such Company Employee Plan being a "Seller Plan"). The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall remain liable, and shall reimburse Parent in accordance with past practice, for insurance premiums and claims incurred by the current and former employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, whether such claims are made prior to, on or after the Closing Date, under any Seller Plans that are "welfare plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA).

reasonably required in connection with the audit, accounting, tax, litigation,
federal securities disclosure or other similar needs of the party seeking
such records. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.9 will be

 (a) With respect to indemnification for Losses arising out of or relating to any breaches of any representation or warranty by Seller in this Agreement (other than Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.17(m) (the "Fundamental Reps"), as to which Sellers obligations under Section 8.1(a) shall survive indefinitely and any breaches of Sellers representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18 which are addressed in Section 5.4 and as to which Seller shall have no indemnification obligations under Section 8.1(a)) and to the Scheduled Matter, such obligation to indemnify shall terminate on the earlier of (x) a date eighteen months after the Closing and (y) March 1, 2008, unless before such termination date Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a Claim Notice with respect to which any claim for indemnification set forth therein has not been finally resolved as contemplated by this Article VIII as of the expiration of such period, provided that such obligation to indemnify shall continue beyond such period only with respect to any such unresolved claim and only until such unresolved claim is finally resolved as contemplated by this Article VIII; 

  

 (b) Except with respect to any breach of the Fundamental Reps or the Covered Matter, there shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(a) unless the 

   ##### 

  

    

aggregate of all Losses for which Parent and Seller, but for this clause (b),
would be liable under Section 8.1(a) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to $4,500,000, and then only to the extent of such excess; 

  

 (c) Except with respect to any breach of the Fundamental Reps: 

   

 (i) subject to clause (ii) of this Section 8.2(c), there shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(a) to the extent amounts previously actually indemnified under Section 8.1(a) are, in the aggregate, in excess of $28,700,000 (the "General Indemnity Cap"); 

   

 (ii) with respect only to the Specified Matters, there shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(a) in respect of such Specified Matters to the extent amounts previously actually indemnified under Section 8.1(a) in respect thereof are, in the aggregate, in excess of $10,000,000 (the "Special Indemnity Cap"), it being understood that in the event that the aggregate amount of the Losses incurred by, or claimed or assessed against, the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of the Specified Matters exceeds the Special Indemnity Cap, such excess shall remain subject to indemnification under Section 8.1(a) to the extent that there is then any remaining availability under the General Indemnity Cap; it being understood that Losses related to the Specified Matters shall first be applied against the Special Indemnity Cap and then against the General Indemnity Cap in accordance with this Article VIII; and 

   

 (iii) the aggregate liability of Parent and Seller under Section 8.1(a) shall not exceed the sum of the General Indemnity Cap and, subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding clause (ii), the Special Indemnity Cap; 

  

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Parents and Sellers obligations under Section 8.1(a) relating to the Covered Matter shall survive indefinitely;

 (f) Each Loss shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by the relevant Buyer Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss, (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the relevant Buyer Indemnified Person from any third party with respect to such Loss, and (iii) any reduction in Taxes actually realized by the relevant Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss in the year such Loss was actually incurred. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Notice of Claim; Defense_. (a) If (i) any third-party institutes or asserts any claim, demand, investigation, action or proceeding (each of the foregoing, a "Proceeding") that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an "Indemnifying Party") may be liable for indemnification under this Article VIII (a "Third-Party Claim") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), then, in case of clause (i) or (ii), the Indemnified Party shall reasonably promptly send 

    ##### 

  

 

to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such claim
and, to the extent practicable, the estimated amount of all related
liabilities (a "Claim Notice"). If an Indemnified Party fails to timely
deliver an adequate Claim Notice to any Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying
Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations under this
_Article VIII_ solely (and only) to the extent that it is materially
prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Parties to provide a timely and
adequate Claim Notice. 

   

 (b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, upon prompt notice to the Indemnified Parties, elect to retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with such Proceeding and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel. The Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Proceeding, provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Proceeding and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in connection with such Proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Proceeding without the relevant Indemnified Parties prior written consent, unless the terms of such settlement provide for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages, which amounts will be indemnified under Section 8.1(a) or (b), as applicable, subject to the limitations set forth in Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel and assume control of such defense (or fails to give prompt notice of its intention to do so) or if conflicts of interests exist or arise between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party (other than with respect to the Covered Matter), or different defenses are available with respect to such Proceeding, then the Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel in connection with such Proceeding and assume control of the defense in connection with such Proceeding, and the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel selected by each Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed promptly by the Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement of any Proceeding that is entered into without its prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). 

  

 (c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties). 

  

 (d) After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to pursue recovery under the existing insurance policies of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or their respective predecessors) with respect to any Losses related to the Covered Matter. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ or Section 5.4 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 8.5 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_. (a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery solely by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of each party in connection with the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall be as provided in this _Article VIII_ or, with respect to Section 3.18, in Section 5.4, except for willful misconduct or common law fraud claims. 

  

 Section 8.6 _Limitation on Set-off_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to set-off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ against any payment due pursuant to _Article I_. 

   

 Section 8.7 _Assumption of Indemnification Obligations_. In the event that Seller or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and assets to any Person (whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise), then, and in each such case and as a condition precedent to the validity of any such action, proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall fully assume the obligations thereof set forth in Sections 5.4, 8.1(a) and 8.1(b) (as applicable). 

   

 Section 8.8 _Survival of Covenants; Investigation_. The parties respective covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive indefinitely unless otherwise set forth herein.
