2\. _The Offer._

2.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have previously been validly
terminated in accordance with its terms, as promptly as practicable following
the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than October 4, 2010),
Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser shall, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer for all
(or, solely in the circumstances described in Section 2.1(e)(ii), the Reduced
Purchase Amount) of the outstanding Company Shares for a price per Company
Share equal to the Per Share Amount (as adjusted as provided in Section
2.1(h)). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer
to Purchase") and form of the related letter of transmittal (the Schedule TO,
the Offer to Purchase and any other ancillary documents pursuant to which
the Offer will be made, together with all exhibits, supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer
Documents") that contain the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and Annex A. The date on which Purchaser commences the Offer, within the
meaning



 

12  of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Offer Commencement Date."

 

(b) Subject to the extension rights of the parties set forth in this
Agreement, the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of
each of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the "Tender Offer Conditions").
Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, promptly (within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, (i) all
Company Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
properly withdrawn) or (ii) in the circumstances contemplated by Section
2.1(e)(ii), Company Shares representing the Reduced Purchase Amount (such date
of acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Time"). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company
Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchaser pursuant to the Offer.
The Per Share Amount shall be net to the seller in cash, without interest,
subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or stock transfer Taxes
payable by or with respect to such seller. No Company Shares held by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(c) Each of Parent and Purchaser expressly reserves the right from time to
time, in its sole and absolute discretion, to increase the Per Share Amount,
waive any Tender Offer Condition or amend, modify or supplement any of the
Tender Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall,
without the prior written consent of the Company and except as otherwise
permitted or required by Sections 2.1(d)-(f):

 

(i) change or waive the Minimum Condition;

 

(ii) decrease the number of Company Shares sought to be purchased by Purchaser
in the Offer;

 

(iii) reduce the Per Share Amount;

 

(iv) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer;

 

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

 

(vi) amend, modify or supplement any of the Tender Offer Conditions (other
than to waive such Tender Offer Conditions); or

(vii) amend, modify or supplement terms of the Offer in a manner that
adversely affects the holders of Company Shares in their capacities as
holders of Company Shares.



 

13 (d) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the day
that is twenty (20) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the Offer Commencement Date (the
"Initial Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the
Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, (i) Purchaser
shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or the NASDAQ Global
Market ("Nasdaq") that is applicable to the Offer, and (ii) if, on the Initial
Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to
expire (together with the Initial Expiration Date, the "Expiration Date"),
any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied or waived, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer for one (1) or more successive periods as determined by Purchaser of
up to ten (10) business days each (or any longer period as may be requested
by Purchaser and approved in advance by the Company) in order to permit the
satisfaction of all of the Tender Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event with respect to either clause (i) or (ii) shall Purchaser be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date; and _provided_ _further_
_however_ , that if, at the Initial Expiration Date or at any subsequent
Expiration Date (other than any such Expiration Date that follows an
extension of the Offer pursuant to Sections 2.1(e)(i) or 2.1(f)), all of the
Tender Offer Conditions (except for the Minimum Condition) are satisfied or
have been waived, Purchaser shall only be required to extend the Offer and
its Expiration Date beyond the Initial Expiration Date or such subsequent
Expiration Date for one or more successive periods in order to permit the
satisfaction of all of the Tender Offer Conditions for an aggregate of
forty (40) business days, unless the Minimum Condition shall be satisfied
earlier. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.1(e) and 2.1(f), neither
Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer in any manner other than pursuant
to and in accordance with this Section 2.1(d) without the prior written
consent of the Company. The Offer shall not be terminated prior to the Outside
Date, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section
9.1, in which case Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event
more than one business day) after such termination of this Agreement. Nothing
in this Section 2.1(d) shall affect any termination rights in Section 9.1.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 2.1(d), if,
at any Expiration Date, all of the Tender Offer Conditions (including the
Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or have been waived, but the
number of Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn is less than that number of Company Shares which, when
added to the number of Company Shares that may be issued pursuant to the Top-
Up Option in compliance with Section 2.3, would represent at least one (1)
Company Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding
Company Shares then outstanding (including such Company Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option) (the "Short-Form Merger Threshold"), then in
such case Purchaser may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without the
consent of the Company:

(i) extend the Offer for one (1) or more successive periods as determined by
Purchaser of up to ten (10) business days each (or any longer period as may be
requested by Purchaser and approved in advance by the Company) until the
Outside Date in order to permit additional Company Shares to be tendered into
the Offer such that the Short-Form Merger Threshold may be attained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any other

 



 

14  provision of this Agreement, in the event Purchaser elects to extend the
Offer pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 2.1(e)(i), then each of
Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all of the
Tender Offer Conditions (other than the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by
clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ , which shall remain in full force and effect)
and its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i),
9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c) (as it relates to the Tender Offer Condition
contemplated by clause (iii)(d) of _Annex A_ , but not as it relates to the
Tender Offer Condition contemplated by clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ ), or
9.1(d) (it being acknowledged and agreed that, (A) notwithstanding such
irrevocable waiver, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither
Parent nor Purchaser shall be permitted to accept for payment (or pay for)
any Company Shares that are tendered in the Offer unless the Minimum
Condition is satisfied at such time, (B) during any extension of the Offer
pursuant to this Section 2.1(e)(i), the Company shall not exercise any
remedies against Parent or Purchaser for failure to accept for payment (or
pay for) any Company Shares that are tendered in the Offer, and (C) if for any
reason other than a failure of the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by
clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ , Purchaser does not accept for payment (and pay
for) all Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn at the expiration of such successive period(s), then Parent and
Purchaser shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement); or

(ii) (A) amend the Offer and the Offer Documents (but only to the extent
required by applicable Law) to reduce the Minimum Condition to such number of
Company Shares (the "Reduced Purchase Amount") such that following the
purchase of Company Shares in the Offer, Parent and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, including Purchaser, would own forty-nine and nine-tenths
percent (49.9%) of the Company Shares then outstanding and (B) purchase, on a
pro rata basis based on the Company Shares actually deposited in the Offer by
such each holder of Company Shares, Company Shares representing the Reduced
Purchase Amount in the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, in the event Purchaser purchases a
number of Company Shares equal to the Reduced Purchase Amount pursuant to and
in accordance with this Section 2.1(e)(ii), then, without the prior written
consent of Parent and Purchaser, at all times prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall take no action whatsoever (including the
redemption of any Company Shares) that would have the effect of increasing the
percentage of direct or indirect ownership of Company Shares by Parent and its
controlled affiliates, including Purchaser, in excess of forty-nine and nine-
tenths percent (49.9%).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 2.1(d), if,
at any Expiration Date, all of the Tender Offer Conditions (including the
Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or have been waived, but (i)
there exists an uncured Financing Failure and (ii) such Financing Failure
impedes the ability of Parent or Purchaser to accept Company Shares for
payment in the Offer, then: (A) Purchaser shall be permitted to extend the
Offer for one (1) or more successive periods as determined by Purchaser of up
to ten (10) business days each (or any longer period as may be requested by
Purchaser and approved in advance by the Company) until the Outside Date in
order to permit such Financing Failure to be cured; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that 



 

15  notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event
Purchaser elects to extend the Offer pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 2.1(f), then each of Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived all of the Tender Offer Conditions (other than the Tender
Offer Condition contemplated by clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ , which shall
remain in full force and effect) and its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i), 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c) (as it relates
to the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by clause (iii)(d) of _Annex A_ ,
but not as it relates to the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by clause
(iii)(e) of _Annex A_ ), or 9.1(d) (it being acknowledged and agreed that, (A)
notwithstanding such irrevocable waiver, without the prior written consent of
the Company, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be permitted to accept
for payment (or pay for) any Company Shares that are tendered in the Offer
unless the Minimum Condition is satisfied at such time, (B) during any
extension of the Offer pursuant to this Section 2.1(f), the Company shall not
exercise any remedies against Parent or Purchaser for failure to accept for
payment (or pay for) any Company Shares that are tendered in the Offer, and
(C) if for any reason other than a failure of the Tender Offer Condition
contemplated by clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ , Purchaser does not accept for
payment (and pay for) all Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn at the expiration of such successive period(s), then Parent
and Purchaser shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement).

(g) If immediately following the Acceptance Time and assuming exercise in full
of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Purchaser and their respective wholly owned
subsidiaries would own less than ninety percent (90%) of the Company Shares
outstanding at that time (after giving effect to the exercise in full of the
Top-Up Option), Purchaser may, in its sole discretion without the consent of
the Company, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one (1) or more
extensions thereof) following the Acceptance Time (as provided in Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act). Promptly (within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after any Company Shares are validly
tendered during any such subsequent offering period (or extension thereof),
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and
pay for, all such Company Shares. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a
timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchaser pursuant to such subsequent offering
period (or extension thereof). The Per Share Amount shall be net to the
seller in cash, without interest, subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding or stock transfer Taxes payable by or with respect to such seller.
No Company Shares held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
tendered pursuant to such subsequent offering period (or extension thereof).

(h) The Per Share Amount shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to
reflect the effect of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect
to Company Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the payment by Purchaser for the Company Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(h) shall be
construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any
transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.



 

16 (i) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference the Offer Documents. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company
Shares in all material respects to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of federal securities laws. Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agree to correct promptly any information provided
by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all material
respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Purchaser or Parent all information concerning the Company
that is required by applicable federal securities laws in connection with
their obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action
contemplated by this Section 2.1(k). Parent and Purchaser shall give the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the
Company and its counsel. In addition, unless there shall have been a Change in
Recommendation by the Company Board in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) provide the Company and its
counsel in writing with any written comments Parent, Purchaser or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to provide a reasonably detailed description of any
oral comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt of such comments, and (iii) provide the Company and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral response
to such comments or any proposed amendment to the Offer Documents prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC.

2.2 Company Action.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of such approval and of the determination and
recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 4.4(b). The Company
shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse
to Purchaser or Parent except as provided in Section 7.5(b). The Company
represents that it has been advised by its directors and executive officers
that they intend to tender all Company Shares beneficially owned by them to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

(b) Promptly following the filing of the Schedule TO by Purchaser, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") containing, except as provided in Section 7.5(b), the recommendation
of the Company Board described in



 

17  Section 4.4(b). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC on the same day as the Schedule TO
shall be filed with the SEC. The Company shall promptly mail the Schedule
14D-9 to the holders of Company Shares together with the Offer Documents and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated in all material respects to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and
Purchaser agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case in all
material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent or
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser that is required by applicable federal securities laws in
connection with its obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, unless there has been a Change in Recommendation, the Company agrees
to (i) provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel in writing with any
written comments the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
receipt of such comments, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel a reasonably detailed description of any oral
comments the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of
such comments, and (iii) provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral response
to such comments or any proposed amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished (including by instructing its transfer agent to promptly
furnish) to Purchaser mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Company Shares and with security position listings of
Company Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together
with all other available listings and computer files containing names,
addresses and security position listings of record holders and non-objecting
beneficial owners of Company Shares. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Purchaser such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
shareholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such
other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of Company
Shares as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request. Subject to the
requirements of Law, including applicable stock exchange rules, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and
Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels,
listings and files and shall use such information only in connection with the
Transactions. If the Offer is terminated or if this Agreement shall be
terminated, Purchaser and Parent will promptly deliver and cause their
Representatives to deliver to the Company (and delete electronic copies of)
all copies, summaries and extracts of such information then in their
possession or control.



 

18 2.3 Top-Up Option.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option") exercisable only in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in this Section 2.3, to purchase, at a purchase price per share equal to
the Per Share Amount, that number of newly issued Company Shares (the "Top-Up
Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added
to the number of Company Shares collectively owned by Parent or Purchaser at
the time of exercise (excluding Company Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant
to guaranteed delivery instructions as to which delivery has not been
completed at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option), shall constitute one
Company Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the sum of (i) the then
outstanding Company Shares plus (ii) a number equal to the number of Company
Shares issuable upon the conversion of any convertible securities or upon the
exercise of any options, warrants or rights including Company RSUs, Company
SARs, the Company Stock Options and Company Shares to be issued pursuant
to the ESPP, in each case, which are convertible or exercisable prior to the
date that is ten (10) business days after such exercise and the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.3(a), the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for Company
Shares in excess of the number of Company Shares authorized and unissued or
held in the treasury of the Company.

 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, after
accounting for the limitations set forth herein, Parent and Purchaser would
hold one Company Share more than 90% of the then outstanding Company Shares.
The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable (in whole and not in part) at any
time after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event Purchaser desires to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall so notify the Company in writing (the "Top-Up Exercise Notice"), and
shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Company Shares that will be
owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, (ii) the number of Company Shares that Purchaser intends to
purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (iii) the place and time for the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the "Top-Up Closing").
The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice,
deliver notice to Parent and Purchaser in writing confirming the number of
Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor. At the Top-Up
Closing, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares.
Such aggregate price may be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either (A)
entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par
value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by executing and delivering
to the Company a full recourse unsecured promissory note issued by Purchaser
having a principal amount equal to the remainder of such aggregate purchase
price (which promissory note either shall be a demand note or shall have a
stated maturity date of not more than one (1) year from the date of issuance).
Any such promissory note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
prime lending rate prevailing during the period in which any portion of the
principal amount of such promissory note remains outstanding, as published by
The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily

 



 

19  basis on the outstanding principal amount of such promissory note from the
date such promissory note is originally issued until the date of payment in
full of such promissory note, and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.
The Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing
the Top-Up Option Shares, which certificate may include any legends required
by applicable securities laws (or, if the Company does not then issue Company
Shares in certificated form, the applicable number of Company Shares in non-
certificated book-entry form). Upon Purchasers request, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing
to Purchaser the number of Company Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect
to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(d) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal
requirements, including all federal securities laws but excluding the rules
and regulations of Nasdaq. To that end, Parent and Purchaser understand that
the Company Shares which Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in
reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 promulgated
thereunder. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that
Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

 

(e) Upon the delivery by Purchaser to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise
Notice and the tender of the consideration described in Section 2.3(c),
Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be deemed to be
the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise,
notwithstanding that certificates representing those Top-Up Option
Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Purchaser.

(f) The Company agrees that it shall reserve (and maintain free
from preemptive and other similar rights) sufficient authorized but unissued
Company Shares so that the Top-Up Option may be exercised without additional
authorization of Company Shares (after giving effect to Company Shares issued
upon the exercise of Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs or
purchases under the ESPP prior to the Acceptance Time.

(g) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Company Shares as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the "fair market value" of any Dissenting Company Shares
pursuant to Chapter 11 of the CGCL as contemplated by Section 3.8(a).

(h) The number of Company Shares issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option and
the Per Share Amount shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate so as to
restore Purchaser to its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up Option in
the event of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Company Shares

 



 

20  occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the date of exercise of the Top-Up Option; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 2.3(g) shall be construed as permitting the
Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited
by this Agreement.

 

3\. _The Merger._

 

3.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Article 8, and in accordance with the CGCL, at the Effective Time Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").

3.2 Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as practicable (and in any
event within two (2) business days) after the satisfaction or, if
permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing an agreement of
merger or certificate of ownership with the Secretary of State of the State
of California, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the CGCL (the date and time of such filing,
or such later time as shall be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified
in such filing, being the "Effective Time"). Prior to such filing, a closing
shall be held at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 610 Newport Center
Drive, Newport Beach, California, or such other place as the parties shall
agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case
may be, of the conditions set forth in Article 8\. The date on which the
closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if (i)
there exists an uncured Financing Failure on any scheduled Closing Date, (ii)
such Financing Failure impedes the ability of Parent or Purchaser to obtain
the Financing and pay for Company Shares in the Merger, and (iii) each of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 shall otherwise have been satisfied or
waived, then Purchaser shall be permitted to delay the Closing Date and the
Effective Time for a period of up to ninety (90) days to permit such Financing
Failure to be cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, in the event Purchaser elects to delay the
Closing Date pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 3.2, then each of
Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1.

 

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the CGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

21 3.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the Articles of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Articles of
Incorporation; _provided_ , that such Articles of Incorporation shall contain
such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for in Section 7.7 hereof
and Article I of the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Actel Corporation."

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and,
except as determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the
officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. All
outstanding and unvested Company Stock Options held by the non-employee
directors of the Company under 2003 Director Stock Option Plan, as amended,
shall be accelerated by the Company and become exercisable in full immediately
prior to the effectiveness of the resignation or termination of such non-
employee directors and, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective
Time, shall be treated as Terminating Options under Section 3.7(b) hereof.

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities:

 

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares described in Section 3.6(b) and
any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration") payable to the
holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in
Section 3.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate (taking
into account any prior adjustments pursuant to Section 2.1(j)) for all
purposes of this Article 3\.



  

22 (b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned directly by Purchaser or Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof,
and no payment or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind
shall be delivered with respect thereto, and each Company Share held by any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Company (other than
Purchaser) shall remain outstanding, except that the number of such Company
Shares shall be adjusted in the Merger to maintain relative ownership
percentages).

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

3.7 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company SARs.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock
Options, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service
Provider (a "Continuing Option") will be assumed by Parent. Each Continuing
Option assumed by Parent will continue to have, and be subject to the same
terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting restrictions, except for administrative changes that are
not adverse to the holder of the Continuing Option or to which the holder
consents and except that (i) each Continuing Option will be exercisable for a
number of shares of common stock of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") equal
to the product of the number of Company Shares that would be issuable upon
exercise of the Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by a quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger
Consideration by (B) the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on
Nasdaq for the five trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the
Effective Time (the "Exchange Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Continuing Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per
share exercise price for such Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, and (iii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company
Stock Option Plans and the stock option agreements will be references to
Parent. It is the intention of the parties that each Company Stock Option so
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive
stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted
under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Company Stock Option
qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock Options, each Company
Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
is not a Continuing Option (a "Terminating Option") shall in each case be
cancelled at the Effective Time. Each Terminating Option that is vested and
exercisable at the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated



 

23  vesting occurring in connection with the Transactions and/or the holders
termination of employment on or prior to the Effective Time) and has a per-
share exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (x) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per-share
exercise price of such Terminating Option by (y) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Terminating Option, less all applicable deductions and
withholdings required by law to be withheld in respect of such
payment. Terminating Options that are not vested and exercisable at the
Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting referred to
above) shall be automatically cancelled for no consideration at the Effective
Time.

 

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holders of
Company RSUs, each outstanding Company RSU that is then outstanding, unvested
and held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider (a
"Continuing RSU") will be assumed by Parent. Each Continuing RSU assumed by
Parent will continue to have and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
of such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
vesting restrictions, except for administrative changes that are not adverse
to the holder of the Continuing RSU or to which the holder consents and
except that (i) each Company RSU shall cover a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that would
be issuable under the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the
applicable Company Stock Option Plans and restricted stock unit agreements
will be references to Parent. Each Company RSU (or any portion thereof) that
vests and becomes settlable by its terms at the Effective Time will not be
assumed but will instead be converted into the right to receive, in exchange
for the cancellation of such Company RSU (or portion thereof), an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (or
settlable portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any such
payment shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

 

(d) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company RSUs, each Company RSU that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a
Continuing RSU (a "Terminating RSU") shall in each case be cancelled at the
Effective Time. Each holder of a Terminating RSU that is vested at
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting occurring
in connection with the Transactions and/or the holders termination of
employment on or prior to the Effective Time) shall be eligible to receive as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time (or, to the extent required in
order to avoid the holder becoming subject to any Tax, penalty or interest
under Section 409A of the Code, the earliest payment date provided for in the
terms and conditions of the Terminating RSU) an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Terminating RSU, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by Law to be withheld in
respect of such payment. Terminating RSUs that are not vested at the Effective
Time shall be automatically cancelled for no

 



 

24  consideration at the Effective Time. If the payment for any vested
Terminating RSU cannot be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
without triggering any Tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the
Code, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to provide prior to the
Effective Time to Parent with a written schedule specifically identifying the
applicable payment date for each such Terminating RSU that complies with the
payment rules under Section 409A of the Code.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company SARs,
each Company SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
held by a Continuing Employee or Continuing Service Provider (a
"Continuing SAR") will be assumed by Parent. Each Continuing SAR assumed by
Parent will continue to have, and be subject to the same terms and conditions
of such Continuing SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
vesting restrictions, except for administrative changes that are not adverse
to the holder of the Continuing SAR or to which the holder consents and except
that (i) each Continuing SAR will cover a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that are subject
to the Continuing SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price of such
assumed Continuing SAR will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the per share exercise price for such Continuing SAR outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent, and (iii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable
Company Stock Option Plans and the stock appreciation rights agreements will
be references to Parent.

 

(f) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company SARs, each Company SAR that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not a
Continuing SAR (a "Terminating SAR") shall in each case be cancelled at the
Effective Time. Each Terminating SAR that is vested and exercisable at the
Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting occurring in
connection with the Transactions and/or the holders termination of employment
on or prior to the Effective Time) and has a per-share exercise price that is
less than the Merger Consideration shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable per-share exercise price of such
Terminating SAR by (y) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Terminating SAR, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by
law to be withheld in respect of such payment. Terminating SARs that are not
vested and exercisable at the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting referred to above) shall be automatically cancelled for no
consideration at the Effective Time.

 

(g) The rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any offering period
underway immediately prior to the Effective Time under the ESPP shall be
determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as
the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period
but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective
and completed



 

25  offering period for all purposes under the ESPP. After the date of this
Agreement, no new participants shall be permitted to enroll in the ESPP, no
participant may increase the rate of his or her participation in the ESPP
from the level in effect on the date of this Agreement, and no new offering or
purchase period shall commence under the ESPP.

 

(h) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall timely provide notice (in
a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding
award granted pursuant to any Company Stock Option Plan, as well as each
participant in the ESPP, describing the treatment of such award and/or plan,
as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 3.7. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall timely take (or cause there to be
taken, as the case may be) such actions, shall obtain such consents, and adopt
(or cause there to be adopted) any amendments of any Company Stock Option Plan
and any awards thereunder, as well as the ESPP, as may be necessary to effect
the transactions and terminations contemplated by this Section 3.7.

 

(i) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
business days, following the Effective Time a registration statement on Form
S-8 (to the extent available) with respect to the Parent Common Stock subject
to such Continuing Options, Continuing SARs and Continuing RSUs. It is
intended that the assumption of the Continuing Options, Continuing SARs and
Continuing RSUs assumed by Parent shall comply with Sections 409A and 424 of
the Code and this Section 3.7 shall be construed consistent with such
intent. 

3.8 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held of record by shareholders who shall have not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly exercised
dissenters rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL (collectively,
the "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the "fair market value" of such Dissenting Company
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Chapter 13,
except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by shareholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Chapter 13
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 3.9, of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Company Shares.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments, notices, petitions, or other communication received from
shareholders or provided to shareholders by Company with respect to any
Dissenting Company Shares or shares claimed to be Dissenting Company Shares,
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the CGCL. Payment of any amount payable
to the holders of

 



 

26  Dissenting Company Shares shall be the obligation of Company. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.9(a) to pay for Dissenting Company Shares
shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 

3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of funds
to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
3.6(a). From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate amount
payable pursuant to Section 3.6(a). In the event the amounts deposited with
the Paying Agent shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds
required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payment of the
funds to holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Section 3.9. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or (after
the Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation, and any and all interest earned
on the funds shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent or (after the
Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall
bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of Paying Agent,
incurred in connection with the payment of funds to holders of Company Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.6(a) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the "Certificates")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with this Agreement 



 

27  upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificates. 

(c) At any time following the end of the ninth month after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that may
be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Share for any Merger
Consideration properly delivered in respect of such Company Share to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law.

 

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against claims that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 

3.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, and their respective agents, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and
the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ("Treasury Regulations"), or
any provision of state, local, foreign or other Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

3.11 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its

  

 

28  officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary,
proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of
such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise
to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

Option or Company SAR was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by
all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof), or a

the necessary number of votes or written consents. The ESPP was duly
authorized prior to the date any award or right was granted thereunder by all
necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company

other than as to rights outstanding under the ESPP as to the purchase period
in effect thereunder as of the date of this Agreement.

4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject in
the case of the Merger to obtaining the Required Shareholder Vote, if
required, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and

Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the Required
Shareholder Vote, if and to the extent required by applicable Law, and the
filing of

 



 

32  appropriate merger documents as required by the CGCL). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and

at which all of the directors of the Company were present, unanimously (i)

including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively, the
"Transactions"), are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and holders of Company Shares, (ii) approved this Agreement, the
Tender and Support Agreement and the Transactions (such approval having been
made in accordance with the CGCL) for all purposes, including for purposes of
the Company Rights Agreement, and (iii) recommended that the holders of
Company Shares accept the Offer and tender Company Shares pursuant to
the Offer, and to the extent required by applicable Law, approve this
Agreement and the Transactions. A true and complete copy of any resolutions of
the Company Board reflecting any approvals referred to in the preceding
sentence has been made available to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

4.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
subject to obtaining the Company Required Approvals and, in the case of the
Merger, the Required Shareholder Vote, if required, conflict with or violate
any U.S. or non-U.S. law, including any statute, ordinance, regulation, rule,
code, constitution or executive order of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or (iii) subject to obtaining the consents that are
required to be listed in Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Letter, result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default or breach) under, or (except with
respect to Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company SARs and the ESPP in
connection with the treatment of such awards and plan under Section 3.7) give
to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, or result in the loss of a
material benefit under any Company Material Contract or material Permit to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or asset of any of them is
bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
that, individually or in the



 

33  aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially
delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
(y) have a Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, except (i) for (x)
applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), (y) the pre-merger
notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and similar requirements in foreign
countries regarding antitrust or competition matters, and (z) filing of
appropriate merger documents as required by the CGCL (collectively, the
"Company Required Approvals"), and (ii) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to (x) prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction,
including with respect to any Environmental Laws, necessary for each of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties
or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits"),
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of
the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of
any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
and there have occurred no defaults under, violations of, or events giving
rise to a right of termination, amendment or cancellation of any such Permits
(with or without notice, the lapse of time or both), except where the failure
to have, or the suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is,
and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary since January 6, 2008 has
been, in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (i) any Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or
(ii) any material Permit to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such
conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has, since
January 6, 2008, received any written notice from any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction alleging that it is not in compliance in
all material respects with any Law, except for those instances where such
non-compliance has been resolved in all material respects.

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of July 4, 2010,
including the notes thereto (the "July 2010 Balance Sheet"), neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability, commitment, contingency
or obligation of a nature required by GAAP to be disclosed on a



 

35  consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except for (i) liabilities,
commitments, contingencies and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of the July 2010
Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities, commitments, contingencies and obligations
that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually

applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Reports,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Section 4.7(d), "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive

Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the
SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or
other of the SEC Reports.

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting and accounting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a material effect
on the Companys financial statements is permitted only in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

 

(g) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or

 



 

36  submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is
accumulated and made known to its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

 

(h) The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended January
3, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The
Company has disclosed to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company (and made copies of such disclosures available to
Parent) (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting, and (C) any written
claim or allegation of any of the foregoing. The Company has not
received from its independent auditors any oral or written notification of a
(i) "reportable condition" or (ii) "material weakness" in the Companys
internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "reportable
condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them in
the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on the date hereof.

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the July 2010
Balance Sheet through the date of this Agreement, except as contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with

date of this Agreement, (i) there has not been any event, condition,
circumstance, development, change or effect, having, or that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has

Authority of competent jurisdiction, in each case, that would reasonably be
expected to (x) prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Letter lists all Plans. The "Plans"
shall mean (in each case, whether written or unwritten): (i) all material
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all material bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
material employment, termination or severance Contracts to which the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate is a party (except for Contracts that provide for
employment that is terminable at will and without material cost or material
liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless any such
Contract constitutes a Company Material Contract), with respect to which the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate has or could have any obligation or that are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate (other than any plans or arrangements required
by applicable Law), (ii) each

 



 

38  employee benefit plan for which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate could
incur liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or
were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv)
any material consulting Contracts, arrangements or understandings between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and any natural person consultant of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (except for consulting contracts that are
terminable without material cost or material liability to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) unless any such Contract constitutes a Company Material
Contract, (all Plans, excluding Plans not subject to U.S. Law, the "US
Plans"). The Company has made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy
of each Plan or form of Plan, as permitted by this Section 4.10 (or a written
description of any Plan that is not set forth in a written document), and has
made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each material
document, if any, prepared in connection with each such Plan (except for (i)
individual written Company Stock Option, Company SAR agreements, and Company
RSU agreements, in which case only forms of such agreements have been made
available, unless such individual agreements materially differ from such forms
and (ii) employment and consulting Contracts for employees hired and based in
locations outside the U.S. and consultants who are natural persons employed or
based in locations outside the U.S., in which case only forms of such
agreements has been made available, unless such individual agreements
materially differ from such forms), including as applicable (i) a copy of each
trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each most recent summary plan
description and summary of material modifications, (iii) annual reports on
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500 for the most recent three (3) plan
years, (iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such
Plan, and (v) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial
statement in connection with each such Plan. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment (i) to create, incur
liability with respect to or cause to exist any other material employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any Contract to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual other than in the ordinary
course of business, or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other
than with respect to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA,
the Code or other applicable law.

 

(b) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"), a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) (a "Multiple Employer
Plan"), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA) or, except as set forth on Section 4.10(b) of the
Disclosure Letter, a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA (any such Plans other than Multiemployer
Plans, a "Title IV Plan"). The present value of each Title IV Plans benefit
liabilities, determined in accordance with actuarial assumptions consistent
with those prescribed by Section 412 and 430 of the Code and Section 302 and
303 of ERISA, does not exceed the fair market value of all plan assets
allocable to such liabilities under Title IV of ERISA. No Title IV Plan has
failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard (within the meaning of Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) applicable to such Title IV Plan, and
no Title IV Plan has filed an application for a waiver of the minimum funding
standard with respect to the Title IV Plan. None of the Plans (i) provides
for the payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits
to any person, (ii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay
separation, severance, termination or 



 

39  similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any Transaction, or
(iii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any payment or
provide any benefit in connection with a "change in ownership or effective
control," within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code, or
in connection with an event directly or indirectly related to such a change.
None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or
life insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as required by Section 4980B
of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state or
foreign law.

(c) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under and
are not in material default under or in material violation of, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no material default or material violation
by any party to, any Plan. No Action (or arbitration or mediation by or before
any Governmental Authority) is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits in
the ordinary course of business) and to the knowledge of the Company, no fact
or event exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to any such Action
which would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates.

 

(d) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination, notification or advisory letter from the IRS covering all of
the provisions applicable to the US Plan for which such letters are currently
available that the US Plan is so qualified, has a remaining period of
time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype
plan or volume submitter plan, and each trust established in connection with
any US Plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS
that it is so exempt, has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or
may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan or volume submitter
plan. No Company capital stock is used as a funding vehicle or otherwise
permitted as an investment option (other than via a personal brokerage or
similar account) with respect to any US Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(e) There has not been any material prohibited transaction (within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Plan. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under, arising out of or
by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or
(ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan and
no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such liability. There are
no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened by



 

40  the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction with respect to any Plan.

 

(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any US Plan have been made on or before their due dates, except as would
not result in material liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
All such contributions are or were fully deductible for federal income tax
purposes in all material respects and no such deduction has been challenged
or disallowed by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance, in each case,
except as would not result in material liability to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries.

(g) Each Plan that provides any compensation that is deferred compensation
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code complies in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code so as to avoid any Tax, penalty or
interest thereunder.

 

(h) The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be
made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or pursuant to other arrangements with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Plans, to holders
of Company Common Stock and other securities of the Company (the "Covered
Securityholders") (with all such plans and arrangements being collectively
referred to as the "Company Arrangements"). All such amounts payable under
the Company Arrangements (i) have been or are being paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) were not, and are
not, calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The adoption, approval,
amendment or modification of each Company Arrangement has been or will be
approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the
instructions thereto and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule
14d10(d)(2) is or will otherwise be applicable thereto as a result of the
taking prior to the Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the Company
Board, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "Company
Compensation Committee") or its independent directors. No such payment has
been made or any such benefit provided, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is obligated to make any such payment or provide any such
benefit (absent such requisite and timely approval in order for the "safe
harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) to apply to such payment or
benefit), that could cause Rule 14d-10 to be violated in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) Except as set forth on Section 4.10(i) of the Disclosure Letter, no Plan
is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any
employee residing or working outside the United States (any such Plan, a "Non-
US Plan"). With respect to any Non-US Plans, (A) all Non-US Plans have been
established, maintained and administered in compliance in all

 



 

41  material respects with their terms and all applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, orders, decrees, judgments, writs, and regulations of any
controlling Governmental Authority, (B) all Non-US Plans that are required to
be funded are fully funded, and with respect to all other Non-US Plans,
adequate reserves therefor have been established on the July 2010 Balance
Sheet, and (C) no material liability or obligation of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries exists with respect to such Non-US Plans that has not
been disclosed on Section 4.10(i) of the Disclosure Letter.

 

4.11 Labor and Employment Matters.

 

(a) Since January 6, 2008, there have been no Actions (or any arbitrations or
mediations before any Governmental Authority) between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any of their respective present or former employees or
independent contractors that could result in material liability or legal costs
to the Company. There are no Actions (or any arbitrations or
mediations before any Governmental Authority) or material controversies
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and any of their respective present or former employees
or independent contractors that could result in material liability or legal

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a named party to any
collective bargaining agreement, work council agreement, work force agreement
or any other labor union Contract applicable to persons employed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; to the knowledge of the Company, none
of the employees or independent contractors of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is represented by any union, works council, or any other labor

agreement, work council agreement or other labor contract currently pending
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and (ii) there are no unfair
labor practice complaints pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company,

National Labor Relations Board or any court, tribunal or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction, or any current union representation
questions involving employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(d) All individuals who are or were performing consulting or other services
for the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been correctly classified by
the Company or the Company Subsidiary in all material respects as either
"independent contractors" or "employees" as the case may be in accordance with
all applicable Laws, except where misclassification would not reasonably
result in material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) All U.S. based individuals who are or were performing services for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as employees have been correctly classified
by the Company or the Company Subsidiary in regard to such employees
classification for purposes of exemption

material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(f) There is no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threat thereof, by or with respect to any employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No consent of any labor union is

inform, consult or obtain consent in advance of or simultaneously with
the Transactions of any works council, employee representatives or other
representative bodies in order to consummate the Transactions.

 

(g) The Company has made available to Purchaser a list, as of the date hereof,
of (i) each employee and natural person consultant that provides services to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary and the city and state in which each
such employee and consultant is based and primarily performs his or her duties

applicable wages and hour laws, visa status (as applicable) and date of hire.
The Company has made available to Purchaser a true and correct copy of all
material written employment and consulting contracts of each employee who is
reasonably expected to be provided with annual base salary greater than
$200,000 for services as an employee in the U.S. or greater than the

natural person consultant who is reasonably expected to be provided with an
annual expected compensation that is greater than $500,000 for services as an

$100,000, or for services as independent contractor with target annual
compensation that is greater than $500,000.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, no key employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or is otherwise bound
by, any Contract with a former employer, including any confidentiality, non
competition or proprietary rights agreement, that in any way materially and
adversely affects (i) the performance of his or her duties as an employee,
officer or director of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, or (ii) the
ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to conduct its business. To
the knowledge of the Company, no employee, officer or director of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is in violation, in any material respect, or has
been accused of being in violation, in any material respect,

 



 

43  of any term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law
nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, non competition agreement or
restrictive covenant to a former employer. 

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor,
including those related to wages, hours, collective bargaining, equal
employment opportunity, occupational health and safety, immigration,
individual and collective consultation, notice of termination, and redundancy,
and are not materially liable for any arrears of wages, Taxes, penalties or
other sums for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. There is no charge
or other Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened before
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the "EEOC"), any court, or
any other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction with respect to the
employment practices of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or
citation by, any the EEOC or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction relating to employees or employment practices. Since January 6,
2008, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice
of intent by the EEOC or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment Laws to
conduct an investigation or inquiry relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such investigation
or inquiry is in progress. The employment of those employees of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries who have been hired and based in the U.S. is
terminable at will without material cost or material liability to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, except for amounts earned prior to the time of
termination.

(j) During the three years preceding the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN
Act") (or any similar and applicable state, local or foreign Law)) affecting
any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any
site of employment or facility of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
(ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act (or any similar and
applicable state, local or foreign Law)) affecting any site of employment or
facility of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except in such cases in
which the Company complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the WARN Act (or any similar and applicable state, local or foreign Law).

(k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Contract
with (i) any U.S. based director, manager, employee, or independent contractor
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that obligates the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to pay or provide to such person any severance or
acceleration of vesting of any equity rights or benefits upon either a
termination of such persons employment or consulting relationship with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or upon a change in control of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary; or (ii) any non-U.S. based director, manager,
employee, or independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that provides for severance to such individual beyond what is statutorily
required by applicable local law or acceleration of vesting of any equity
rights or benefits



 

44  upon either a termination of such persons employment or consulting
relationship with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or upon a change in
control of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company estimates in
good faith that, based on the assumptions set forth in Section 4.11(k) of the
Disclosure Letter, the aggregate payments under the Amended and Restated
Employee Retention Plan would not exceed the amount set forth in Section
4.11(k).

4.12 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement. Neither the Schedule
14D-9 nor any information supplied by the Company to Parent specifically for
inclusion in the Offer Documents shall, at the times the Schedule 14D-9, the

shareholders of the Company in connection with the Shareholders Meeting nor
the information statement to be sent to such shareholders, as appropriate
(such proxy statement or information statement, as amended or supplemented,

the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed
to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
Shareholders Meeting that shall have become false or misleading. The Schedule
14D-9 and the Proxy Statement and the information supplied by the Company
specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents shall comply in all
material respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information

for inclusion in any of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy
Statement.

to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such
exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be

or any portion thereof or interest therein, and to the knowledge of the
Company, no such proceedings are threatened or proposed. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted to any
other person any rights to use, occupy or possess any part of the Company
Leased Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in the Company

Company Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable rules, policies, and
procedures of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States
Copyright Office, and any applicable foreign Governmental Authorities with
respect to each material item of Registered Company Intellectual Property, to
the extent that compliance affects the enforceability or validity of such
Registered Company Intellectual Property.

(c)  _Trademarks_. All material Trademarks included in the Registered Company
Intellectual Property have been in use sufficient to maintain the
registrability of such Trademarks.

 

(d) _Rights to IP Ordered or Awarded_. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any decree, judgment, order, or arbitral
award that requires the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant to any
Third Party any license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with
respect to any Owned Company Intellectual Property.

 

(e) _No Proceedings_. Since January 6, 2008, no Registered Company
Intellectual Property is or has been involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition, cancellation or other proceeding, including any
proceeding regarding invalidity or unenforceability, in the United States or
any foreign jurisdiction, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
such action has been threatened in any written communication delivered to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(f) _Trade Secrets_. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have, in accordance
with the applicable Law of each relevant jurisdiction, taken reasonable steps
to protect their rights in and to the material Trade Secrets included in the
Owned Company Intellectual Property, including, to the knowledge of the
Company, by not making any disclosure of such Trade Secrets except under
confidentiality obligations (other than former Trade Secrets intentionally
publicly disclosed by the Company without confidentiality obligations in its
reasonable business judgment). To the knowledge of the Company, there has been
no misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of any material Trade Secret
included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property. The Company and Company
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with and have not
breached in any material respect any contractual obligations to protect the
Trade Secrets of Third Parties in accordance with the terms of any
Contracts relating to such Third Party Trade Secrets.

(g) _Employees, Consultants, and Contractors_. The Company and Company
Subsidiaries have and use reasonable efforts to enforce policies generally
requiring each employee, individual consultant and individual contractor who
is involved in the development of any Company Products to execute
proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements that, to
extent permitted by applicable Law, assign to the Company and/or a Company
Subsidiary all

 



 

47  Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by
the employees within the scope of their employment, and, with respect to
consultants or contractors, assign or license to the Company and/or a Company
Subsidiary all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are
developed by the consultants or contractors in the course of performing
services for the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Employee IP
Agreement"). All present and former employees, officers, individual
consultants and individual contractors of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who have developed any material Intellectual Property that is a
part of any Company Products have signed an Employee IP Agreement, in a form
substantially similar to, or with provisions with substantially similar legal
effect as the provisions of, one of the forms made available to Parent with
respect to proprietary information, confidentiality, and assignment and
licensing of Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights. To the
knowledge of the Company, no current or former employee, officer, consultant
or contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who have developed any
Intellectual Property that is a part of any Company Products is in material
default or material breach of any term of any Employee IP Agreement, non-
disclosure agreement, assignment agreement, or similar Contract relating to
Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights entered into between
such employee, officer, consultant or contractor and the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with such individuals employment or
other engagement with the Company or any Company Subsidiary. All assignments
of registered Patents to the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been duly
executed and recorded with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. No
present or former employee, officer, individual consultant or individual
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any ownership, license
or other right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part, in any Owned Company Intellectual Property (other than to the extent
any such individual has a non-exclusive license to use Company Products in the
ordinary course of business). No Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights excluded or carved-out from any employee assignment contained
in any Employee IP Agreement that is related to any Company Product or to any
other aspect of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Employee Retained IP") is included in (or claimed
or purported to be included in) any Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights included in any Company Products (other than Employee Retained
IP that is generally available to the public under Open Source license terms
or that is licensed by the Company from such employee).

(h) _Enforceability, Validity of IP_. To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances that would render invalid or unenforceable any
of the material Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned Company
Intellectual Property (or provide any reasonable grounds therefor). To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
adversely affect, limit, restrict, impair, or impede the ability of Surviving
Corporation and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to use and practice
any material Owned Company Intellectual Property from and after the Effective
Time in the same manner in which it was used prior to the Effective Time.
Since January 6, 2008, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
received any written notice of any Action challenging the validity or
enforceability of any of the Registered Company Intellectual Property, or
containing any threat on the part of any person to bring an Action that any of
the Registered Company Intellectual Property is invalid, is unenforceable or
has been misused, other than any Action finally resolved prior to January 6,
2008.



 

48 (i) _No Infringement or Misappropriation of Company IP_. To the knowledge of
the Company, no Third Party is infringing, misappropriating, or using or
disclosing without authorization any Intellectual Property Rights owned or
exclusively licensed by Company or any Company Subsidiary, except where such
infringement, misappropriation, or use or disclosure, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Since January 6, 2008, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
commenced any Action with respect to infringement or misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary against any Third Party. Since January 6, 2008,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice of any Action challenging the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
exclusive ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned
Company Intellectual Property or claiming that any other person has any claim
of legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto (other than any Action
finally resolved prior to January 4, 2009).

 

(j) _Infringement by Company_. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any Company Product infringes,
misappropriates, uses or discloses without authorization, or otherwise
violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any person, except where such
infringement, misappropriation, or use or disclosure, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Since January 6, 2008, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
not received any written notice of any Action relating to any of the foregoing
and, to the knowledge of Company, there are no facts, circumstances or
information that would be the basis for such Action (other than any Action
finally resolved prior to January 4, 2009). Since January 6, 2008, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written communication
inviting the Company or any Company Subsidiary to take a license, covenant not
to sue, or the like with respect to a Third Partys Intellectual Property
Rights, other than in connection with licenses or covenants not to sue
granted to Company or the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business and not related to any infringement or other violation by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (other than any Action finally resolved prior
to January 4, 2009).

(k) _Ownership; Licenses_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own the
Owned Company Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens (except for
non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business), and have
not exclusively licensed (under any Contract in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) any such Owned Company Intellectual Property to any Third Party,
and are under no obligation to grant any such licenses. No funding,
facilities, or personnel of any Governmental Authority or any public or
private university, college, or other educational or research institution
were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part,
any Owned Company Intellectual Property.

 

(l) _Scheduled IP Agreements_. Section 4.14(l) of the Disclosure Letter
contains a complete and accurate list as of the date of this Agreement of:

(i) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party as of the date of this Agreement, or by which the Company or any



 

49  Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound as of the date of this Agreement,
under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has granted or agreed to
grant to any Third Party any license, covenant, release, immunity,
assignment, or other right with respect to any Company Intellectual Property
(whether now existing or existing in the future) (other than Contracts formed
pursuant to one of the forms made available to Parent (or in a
form substantially similar to, or with provisions with substantially similar
legal effect as the provisions of, one of such forms), confidentiality or
nondisclosure Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, and
Contracts to use the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys Trademarks in
connection with such Third Partys performance under a broker, distributor,
dealer, manufacturers representative, franchise, agency, sales promotion,
market research, marketing, consulting, or advertising agreement); and

(ii) all material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party as of the date of this Agreement, or by which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound as of the date of this Agreement, under
which any Third Party has granted or agreed to grant to Company or
any Company Subsidiary any license, covenant, release, immunity, assignment,
or other right with respect to any Company Intellectual Property (other than
nonexclusive Contracts for Commercially available Software that is licensed on
non-negotiable terms pursuant to Open Source, "shrinkwrap" or "clickwrap"
license agreements, any Contracts to use a Third Partys Trademarks in
connection with the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys performance under a
broker, distributor, dealer, manufacturers representative, franchise,
agency, sales promotion, market research, marketing, consulting, or
advertising agreement, Employee IP Agreements, confidentiality or
nondisclosure Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business,
Contracts to the extent for the purchase or use of equipment or materials, and
Contracts that are ancillary to the purchase or use of equipment or materials
(e.g., support and maintenance contracts).

 

The material Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party, or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise
bound, included in subsection (i) or (ii) above are, collectively, the
"Company Intellectual Property Agreements." There are no pending disputes
regarding such Company Intellectual Property Agreements, including disputes
with respect to the scope thereof, performance thereunder, or payments made
or received in connection therewith.

(m) _Effect of Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or
result in the breach, material modification, cancellation, termination or
suspension of, loss of any rights or acceleration of any payments under the
Company Intellectual Property Agreements (or give rise to any right with
respect to any of the foregoing). Following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will have and be permitted to exercise all of the Companys and
the Company Subsidiaries rights under the Company Intellectual Property
Agreements (and will have the same rights with respect to the Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties under the Company
Intellectual Property Agreements) to the same extent that Company and the
Company Subsidiaries would have had, and been able to exercise, had this
Agreement not been entered into,

 



 

50  and the Transactions not occurred, without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
Company and Company Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay
anyway pursuant to the Company Intellectual Property Agreements. No Contract
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound,
will cause or require (or purports to cause or require) the Surviving
Corporation or Parent to (i) grant to any Third Party any license, covenant
not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under any Intellectual
Property Rights owned by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; or (ii) be
obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any discounts, to
any Third Party (except, in each of (i) and (ii), with respect to Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries only, royalties, other amounts,
discounts, licenses, covenants not to sue, immunities or other rights that
Surviving Corporation would have had to pay, offer or grant had this Agreement
not been entered into and the Transactions not been consummated).

 

(n) _Open Source_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have used
reasonable efforts to (a) identify all Open Source in any Company Product and
(b) regulate the use and distribution of Open Source in compliance with the
applicable Open Source licenses. The Company does not redistribute any Open
Source as part of a Company Product in a manner that requires the Company to
license Software that is Owned Company Intellectual Property and that is
included within a Company Product ("Owned Company Software Product") subject
to an Open Source license that (i) requires the disclosure or distribution in
source code form of any Owned Company Software Product, (ii) requires the
licensing of any Owned Company Software Product for the purpose of making
derivative works, or (iii) requires the licensing of any Owned
Company Software Product to include a licensee right to redistribute such
Owned Company Software Product.

(o) _Standards, SIGs_. Section 4.14(o) of the Disclosure Letter contains a
list of all standards-setting organizations, industry bodies and consortia,
and other multi-party special interest groups in which Company or any Company
Subsidiary is currently participating, or in which Company or any Company
Subsidiary has participated in the past, to the extent that the Company or any
Company Subsidiarys past participation has resulted in continuing obligations
on Company or any Company Subsidiary (or, following the Effective Time, on
Parent or the Surviving Corporation) with respect to licensing of any Owned
Company Intellectual Property Rights (other than licenses that survive with
respect to the copyright in contributions made during such past
participation).

(p) _Contaminants_. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
steps to identify (and, as deemed appropriate by the Company or Company
Subsidiaries, to address) Contaminants, defects, bugs, and errors in the
Software included within the Company Products.

 

4.15 Taxes.

 

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to each
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed.
All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects.
All material Taxes due and owing by Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been duly and timely paid.
There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet delinquent or being



 

51  contested in good faith and for which reserves in accordance with GAAP have
been established on the Company Financial Reports as adjusted in the ordinary
course of business through the Effective Time) upon any assets of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has withheld all material Taxes required to have been withheld in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third party and, to the extent
payable, paid such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance
with applicable law in all material respects, and all material information
returns required to be filed or provided with respect thereto have been
properly completed in all material respects and timely filed or provided, as
applicable.

 

(b) There is no audit, dispute or claim concerning any material Tax liability
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries either claimed or raised by
any taxing authority in writing or otherwise. All material deficiencies for
Taxes asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
been fully and timely paid, settled or properly reflected in the
Company Financial Reports.

(c) No audit is currently pending with respect to any material Tax Return of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has made available to
Purchaser correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns,
examination reports, and statements of material deficiencies assessed against,
or agreed to by the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries since January
31, 2006. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has waived
any statutes of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice, written or otherwise,
of any claim made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns, that the Company
or a Company Subsidiary is or may be required to file Tax Returns or to pay
Taxes in that jurisdiction.

(d) The Transactions (including the Offer and Merger) will not result in the
payment or series of payments by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to any person of any material "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, or any similar payment, that is not
deductible for federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes. Additionally,
there is no contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
is a party that, individually or collectively, (i) could reasonably be
expected to give rise to the payment of any material amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code, or (ii)
could require the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or its
subsidiaries to gross up a payment to any employee of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries for Tax related payments or cause a penalty tax under
Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

 

(e) The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the July 2010 Balance
Sheet have been properly established in accordance with GAAP. Since the date
of the July 2010 Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary
gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, or outside the ordinary course
of business consistent with past custom and practice, and the reserve set
forth on the



 

52  face of the July 2010 Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), as
adjusted through the Effective Time in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, has been properly
established with respect to all material Taxes through the Effective Time in
accordance with GAAP.

 

(f) None of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has been included in any
consolidated, unitary, affiliated or other combined Tax Return (other than
Tax Returns for which the Company is the common parent) under the laws of the
U.S., any foreign jurisdiction or any state or locality with respect to Taxes
for any taxable year, and neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
liability for Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) (other than the
Company or a Company Subsidiary), as transferee, successor, by contract
or otherwise.

(g) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution of stock
intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a
corporation in the two years prior to the Effective Time) or that otherwise
constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code in conjunction with the Offer and the
Merger.

(h) The Company has not been a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

 

(i) None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by
any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in a "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed to or is
required to make any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by
reason of a change in accounting method initiated by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary, and the IRS has not proposed in writing any such
adjustment or a change in any accounting method used by the Company or the
Company Subsidiary. Except as required by applicable law, the Company and the
affiliate have not taken any action inconsistent with its practices in prior
years that would have the effect of deferring a material liability for Taxes
from a period prior to the Effective Time to a period following the Effective
Time. There is no material taxable income or other measure of Tax that will be
reportable (including income reportable under the installment method of
accounting), and no material deduction will be disallowed, in any period
beginning after Closing Date that is attributable to a transaction or event
(other than in the ordinary course of business) that occurred prior to the
Closing Date. 



 

53 4.16 Environmental Matters. (a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is
and for the past five years has been in compliance in all respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws, except where the failure to be in compliance,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (b) (i) none of the properties currently or formerly
owned, leased or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including
soils and surface and ground waters) have at any time been used by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other
person to make, store, handle, treat, dispose of, generate or transport
Hazardous Substances in violation of any applicable Environmental Law, and
(ii) to the knowledge of the Company, none of such properties are
contaminated with any Hazardous Substance for which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is legally responsible for any unperformed investigation or
remediation required by applicable law or any Contract which in the case of
(i) or (ii), individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; (c) to the knowledge of the Company, neither
the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions
will require any investigation or remediation with respect to Hazardous
Substances, or any notice to or consent of Governmental Authorities or Third
Parties, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws or material Permits
required under Environmental Laws; (d) since January 6, 2008 through the date
of this Agreement, no Action (or arbitration or mediation by or before any
Governmental Authority) has been brought, and no Action (or arbitration or
mediation by or before any Governmental Authority) is currently pending,
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, arising under or related to any
Environmental Law or related to any environmental condition, including with
respect to any properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (e) except
with respect to information otherwise made available to Parent in Section
4.16 of the Disclosure Letter, there are no above or below ground storage
tanks presently in use or formerly used by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary at any properties currently or previously owned, leased or operated
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has made available to
Parent any and all written communications with or documentation from any
Governmental Authorities regarding or alleging the presence, in violation of
Environmental Laws, of Hazardous Substances on any properties currently or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
which would reasonably be expected to result in material liability,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company has also made available to Parent all material site
assessments, reports, data, results of investigations, audits or other similar
information that are in the possession of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries regarding the environmental conditions at any properties
currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary which contain information that would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability, individually or in the aggregate, to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, including the compliance (or noncompliance)
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Environmental Laws.

4.21 Customers and Suppliers. Section 4.21 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth

Subsidiaries (based on revenues during the twelve (12) months ended January
3, 2010), and the top ten (10) distributors (based on revenues during the
twelve (12) months ended January 3, 2010) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis). To the Companys actual knowledge,
the Company does not have any material new customers or suppliers since
January 3, 2010 who would have been included on Section 4.21 of the Disclosure
Letter if such customer or supplier had been a customer or supplier during
the twelve (12) month period as of January 3, 2010. Since January 4, 2010 and
through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received any written or oral communication or notice from
any such customer, supplier or distributor to the effect that, any such
customer, supplier or distributor (a) has changed, modified, amended or
reduced, or is reasonably likely to change, modify, amend or reduce, its
business relationship with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
a manner that is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (b) will fail to perform, or is
reasonably likely to fail to perform, its obligations under any Contract with
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in any manner that is, or is
reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

 

4.22 Certain Business Practices.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2000, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
director, officer, nor to the knowledge of the Company any employee or agent
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary acting on behalf of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has offered, nor made, nor promised to make, nor
authorized the making of any gift or payment of money or anything of value
either directly or indirectly, to any officer or employee of a Non-U.S.
Governmental Authority, or to any person acting in an official capacity for or
on behalf of any such Non-U.S. Governmental Authority or to any political
party or candidate for political office (all of the foregoing individuals
being individually and collectively referred to herein as "Foreign Officials")
for purposes of (i) influencing any act or decision of such Foreign Official
in his official capacity, or (ii) inducing such Foreign Official to do or
omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official, or (iii)
inducing such Foreign Official to use his influence with a Non-U.S.
Governmental Authority to affect or influence any act or decision of such
Governmental Authority in order to



 

57  obtain, retain or direct or assist in obtaining, retaining or directing
business to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No officer or director or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or any holder of any financial interest in the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any affiliate thereof, is currently a
Foreign Official.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have at all times been, and are
currently, fully in compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended, or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"FCPA") and any Law equivalent to the FCPA in any jurisdiction.

 

4.23 Data Protection. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have (i)
materially complied with their respective published privacy policies and all
applicable Laws relating to protection of personal data and the privacy and
security of personally identifiable information, including with respect to the
collection, storage, transmission, transfer (including cross-
border transfers), disclosure and use of personally identifiable information
(including personally identifiable information of employees, contractors, and
Third Parties who have provided information to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries) in the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries control; and
(ii) taken commercially reasonable measures to protect personally identifiable
information in Companys and the Company Subsidiaries control against loss,
damage, and unauthorized access, use, and modification. To the knowledge of
the Company, there has been no material loss, damage, or unauthorized access,
use, or modification of any such information by Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or any of their respective employees or contractors). Since
January 6, 2008, to the knowledge of the Company, no person (including any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction) has commenced any Action
with respect to loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use, or modification of
any such personally identifiable information in Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries control by Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their
respective employees or contractors) (and to the knowledge of the Company,
there is no reasonable basis for any such Action).

4.24 Systems and Information Technology. 

(a) _Systems_. The computer, information technology and data processing
systems, facilities and services used by the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, including all hardware, networks, communications facilities,
platforms and related systems and services in the custody or control of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "Systems"), are reasonably
sufficient to perform all computing, information technology and data
processing operations necessary for the operation of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable steps and implemented commercially reasonable
safeguards to protect the Systems within the custody or control of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries from Contaminants. The Company or the Company
Subsidiaries own and operate, or otherwise have a right or license to use,
all Systems. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
have and be permitted to exercise the same rights (whether ownership, license
or otherwise) with respect to the Systems as the Company would have had and
been able to exercise had this Agreement and such other Contracts, documents
and



 

58  instruments to be executed and delivered after the date of this Agreement
not been entered into and the Transactions not occurred, without the payment
of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties
or payments which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries would otherwise
have been required to pay anyway (other than with respect to any Systems that
are generally commercially available on reasonable terms). 

(b) _Information Technology_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
taken commercially reasonable steps to provide for the remote-site back-up of
data and information critical to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(including such data and information that is stored on magnetic or optical
media in the ordinary course of business) in a commercially reasonable
attempt to avoid material disruption or interruption to the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have in place industry standard (and, in any event, not less than
commercially reasonable) disaster recovery and business continuity plans and
procedures.

4.25 Minute Books. The Company has made available to Purchaser true and
correct copies in all material respects of the minute books of the Company
since December 31, 2006. The minute books of the Company contain true and
complete originals or copies of all minutes of meetings of and actions by the
shareholders of the Company and the Company Board and all committees thereof,
and accurately reflect all corporate actions of the Company which are required
by applicable Law, the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws or
other governing documents to be passed upon by the Company Board or the
Companys shareholders.

4.26 Export Control Laws. During the last five years, the Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries has conducted its business in compliance in all
material respects with all laws concerning the export of any products,
technology, technical data and services ("Export Control Laws") in the
countries where it conducts business. Without limiting the foregoing, during
the last five years:

 

(a) the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has obtained all material
export licenses, registrations and other approvals required for its exports
of products, software, technical data, and technologies under applicable
Export Control Laws;

(b) the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of such applicable export licenses,
registrations or other approvals;

 

(c) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any
written communication alleging that it is not or may not be in compliance
with, or has, or may have any, liability under any such applicable export
licenses, registrations or other approvals, or otherwise in respect of Export
Control Laws;

 

(d) there are no claims against, or audits or investigations of, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that are either pending in writing, publicly
disclosed, or, to the



 

59  knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to such export licenses,
registrations or other approvals or otherwise with respect to Export Control
Laws;

 

(e) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has made any
voluntary disclosure to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S.
Department of State, or to the Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S.
Department of Commerce, or to any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority
with respect to possible violations of Export Control Laws, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no circumstance or event that requires
such a voluntary disclosure to be made; and

(f) there are no actions, conditions or circumstances pertaining to the
Companys or any Company Subsidiaries export transactions that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material future claims.

 

4.27 Government Contracts.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries are currently in,
and the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Transactions by the Company will not result in, any
material violation, breach or default of any term or provision or trigger
automatic or optional termination of (i) any material Contract with
any Governmental Authority, (ii) any material subcontract issued at any tier
under a prime contract with any Governmental Authority, or (iii) any material
bid, proposal, offer or quotation relating to a Contract with any Governmental
Authority or a material subcontract issued under a material Contract with any
Governmental Authority. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries are in any material violation, breach or default of any provision
of any federal order, statute, rule or regulation, agency supplements or any
similar state or federal Law governing any material Contract, subcontract,
bid, or proposal with any Governmental Authority, as applicable. None of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received in writing a cure
notice, a show cause notice or a stop work notice and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no such notice is pending, nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries been threatened in writing with termination for default
under any material Contract or subcontract with any Governmental Authority
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such termination is pending. To the
knowledge of the Company, no request for equitable adjustment by any of its
vendors, suppliers or subcontractors against it or any of the Company
Subsidiaries relating to material Contracts or subcontracts involving any
Governmental Authority exists.

 

(b) During the past five years, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received written notice of any claim, and to the knowledge
of the Company, there is no pending claim by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
for any of the following: (i) defective pricing, (ii) noncompliance, (iii)
fraud, (iv) false claims or false statements, (v) unallowable costs, including
those that may be included in indirect cost claims for prior years that have
not yet been finally agreed to by the Governmental Authority, or (vi) any
other monetary claims relating to the



 

60  performance or administration by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of
material Contracts or subcontracts for any Governmental Authority.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been suspended
or debarred from bidding on contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the conduct of its business; no such suspension
or debarment has been initiated, either in writing or publicly, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. To the knowledge of the Company, there
is no ongoing Action (or investigation, arbitration or mediation by or before
any Governmental Authority) by any Governmental Authority relating to the
material Contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental Authority or the
violation of any Law relating to material Contracts or subcontracts with any
Governmental Authority.

(d) No Governmental Authority has any rights with respect to any technical
data or computer software that are material to the business of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(e) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their officers, directors,
managers and employees collectively hold all security clearances necessary
for the operation of their business as presently conducted in all material
respects.

4.28 Affiliate Transactions. There are no existing contracts, transactions,
indebtedness or other arrangements, or any related series thereof, between the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the
directors, officers or other affiliates of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that could have a material binding affect or
obligation on the Company, except for (i) payment of salary for services
rendered, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of
the Company, (iii) any agreements with officers or directors providing for
indemnification obligations of the Company to such individuals and (iv) other
standard employee benefits made generally available to all employees
(including any agreement providing for the issuance of Company Shares, Company
Stock Options, Company SARs or Company RSUs to such individuals).

 

4.29 Company Rights Agreement. The entering into of this Agreement and the
Tender and Support Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not, (i) result in any person
being deemed to have become a "Beneficial Owner" or an "Acquiring Person"
(each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement), (ii) result in the ability
of any person to exercise any Company Rights under the Company Rights
Agreement, (iii) enable or require the Company Rights to separate from the
Company Shares to which they are attached or to be triggered or become
exercisable or (iv) enable the Company to exchange any Company Rights for
shares of the Companys capital stock, pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement. No "Distribution Date," "Shares Acquisition Date," or "Triggering
Event" (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) or similar event has
occurred or will occur by reason of (1) the adoption, approval, execution or
delivery of this Agreement and the Tender and Support Agreement or the
commencement of the Offer, (2) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Tender and Support Agreement or (3) the
public announcement of any of the foregoing. The Company has not amended the
Company Rights



 

61  Agreement, redeemed the Company Rights thereunder or taken any other action
to make the Company Rights Agreement or the Company Rights thereunder
inapplicable, in each case, with respect to (a) any person or entity or (b)
any Acquisition Proposal.

4.30 Vote Required. The affirmative vote on the approval of this Agreement of
the holders of a majority of the Company Shares outstanding on the record date
for the meeting of shareholders of the Company described in Section 7.1 (the
"Required Shareholder Vote") is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Companys capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement or
approve the Merger or otherwise in connection with any Transaction.

 

4.31 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received the opinion
of Goldman, Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date thereof, the
consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent
and its affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view. A written copy thereof shall be made available to
Parent for informational purposes only promptly following the date hereof.

5\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser._

Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:

5.1 Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and California, respectively, and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Purchaser is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing
any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the CGCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser,
enforceable against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, 



 

62  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 

5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
(i) conflict with or violate the Certificate or Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws of either Parent or Purchaser, (ii) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.3(b)(i)
have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section
5.3(b)(i) have been made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
Parent or Purchaser or by which any property or asset of any of them is bound
or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default or
breach) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, or result in the loss of
a material benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or other instrument
or obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing any of
their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of (x) the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and Blue
Sky Laws, (y) the HSR Act and similar requirements in foreign countries where
a merger filing will be necessary or advisable and (z) the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the CGCL, and (ii)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the
aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement.

5.4 Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete fully
executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of October 1, 2010 between
Parent and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc, together with any related fee
letter, engagement letter or other agreement, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter in effect on the date hereof
(and with the understanding that Parent shall have delivered to the Company
only redacted forms of the fee letter and the engagement letter)
(collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof each of the parties thereto (other than Parent)
have severally agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of
such funds as set forth therein, the "Financing") for the purposes set forth
in such Commitment Letter. The

 



 

63  Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or
rescinded in any respect as of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) except
that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Commitment Letter to provide the Financing.
Assuming the satisfaction of the Tender Offer Conditions set forth in clauses
(iii)(d) and (iii)(e) of Annex A, Parent does not have any reasonable basis to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Commitment Letter to provide the Financing required to be
satisfied by it. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements (other than customary fee letters, engagement letters and
confidentiality letters, redacted copies of which have been delivered to the
Company) relating to the commitments to provide the Financing to consummate
the Offer and the Merger. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letter and assuming the satisfaction of the
Tender Offer Condition set forth in clause (iii)(d)(B), the net proceeds
contemplated from the Financing, together with the cash and cash equivalents
of Parent and Purchaser, are and will be, in the aggregate, sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Amount and Merger
Consideration and of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred
by the parties in connection herewith. Parent has fully paid all commitment
fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

5.5 Offer Documents; Proxy Statement; Schedule 14D-9. Neither the Offer
Documents nor any information supplied by Parent or Purchaser to the Company
specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 shall, at the times the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendments or supplements thereto are
filed with the SEC or are first published, sent or given to shareholders of
the Company, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied by Parent to the Company specifically for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, if any, shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Shareholders Meeting
that shall have become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Purchaser make no

 



 

64  representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its Representatives specifically for inclusion in any of the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement. The Offer
Documents and the information supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9 and Proxy Statement, if any, shall comply in all material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

5.6 Absence of Litigation. There is no material Action (or arbitration or
mediation by or before any Governmental Authority) pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened against Parent, any subsidiary of
Parent, or any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent, before
any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is reasonably
likely to prevent the consummation of any Transaction or otherwise prevent
Parent or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent nor any property or
asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is subject to any material
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or similar written
agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser,
continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination
or award of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is
reasonably likely to prevent consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their material
obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.7 Purchaser. All of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser is owned
directly by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions,
Purchaser has not incurred any obligations or liabilities, and has
not engaged in any business or activities of any type or kind whatsoever or
entered into any Contracts or arrangements with any person or entity.

 

5.8 Vote Required. No vote of the holders of any of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

6\. _Conduct of Business Pending the Merger._

 

6.1 Conduct of the Business Pending the Merger. Between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of (1) the Effective Time and (2) the date upon
which Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the members on the
Company Board pursuant to Section 7.3 (the "Control Date"), except (w) with
the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), (x) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (y) as set forth
in Section 6.1 of the Disclosure Letter or (z) as required in compliance with
all applicable Laws, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause the Company

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to keep available the services of
the current officers, employees and consultants of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to preserve the current relationships of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with its customers, suppliers, distributors,

65  other persons with which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
business relations. In addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing,

Section 6.1 of the Disclosure Letter or (z) required in compliance with all
applicable Laws, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries

7\. _Additional Agreements._

 

7.1 Shareholders Meeting.

 

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, (i)
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of
its shareholders as promptly as practicable following consummation of the
Offer (or, if later, following the termination of the subsequent offering
period, if any) for the purpose of considering and taking action on this
Agreement and the Transactions (the "Shareholders Meeting"), and (ii) subject
to the terms of this Agreement, (A) include in the Proxy Statement, and not
subsequently withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent,
the unanimous recommendation of the Company Board that the shareholders of the
Company 



 

69  approve the principal terms of the Merger and (B) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain such approval. The Company shall ensure that the
Shareholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all parties solicited in connection with the Shareholders Meeting are
solicited, in compliance with all applicable Law. At the Shareholders
Meeting, Parent and Purchaser shall cause all Company Shares then owned by
them and their subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.1, including its obligation to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting after
the Acceptance Time shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Superior
Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser shall hold,
together with all Company Shares held by Parent, at least ninety percent
(90%) of the then outstanding Company Shares, the parties hereto agree,
subject to Article 8, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to become effective in accordance with Section 1110 of the CGCL,
as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours unless
otherwise restricted or prohibited by applicable Law) after such acquisition,
without a meeting of the shareholders of the Company. 

7.2 Proxy Statement. If approval of the Companys shareholders is required by
applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then, as promptly as practicable
following consummation of the Offer (or, if later, following the termination
of the subsequent offering period, if any), the Company shall file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, and the Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any
requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
and summaries of all oral exchanges between the Company or any representative
of the Company and the SEC. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to its being filed with the SEC,
and shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review all responses
to requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their
being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with
the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement and all
required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of
Company Shares entitled to vote at the Shareholders Meeting at the earliest
practicable time.

 

7.3 Company Board Representation; Section 14(f).

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, upon the Acceptance Time and
from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to
such number of



 

70  directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as
shall give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product
of (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to
the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (y) the
percentage that the aggregate number of Company Shares beneficially owned by
Purchaser and any subsidiary of Purchaser following such acceptance for
purchase bears to the total number of Company Shares then outstanding, and the
Company shall, at such time, promptly take all actions reasonably necessary to
cause Purchasers designees to be elected as directors of the
Company, including, at Parents election, by increasing the size of the
Company Board or seeking and accepting the resignations of incumbent
directors, or both; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all events the minimum
number of the members of the Company Board shall be five (5) and Purchasers
designees shall be of such number so as to constitute at least a majority of
the members of the Company Board, including in the circumstance where the
number of Company Shares purchased in the Offer shall have been reduced to
the Reduced Purchase Amount in the manner contemplated by Section 2.1(f) or
2.1(g). At such times, the Company shall cause persons designated by Purchaser
to constitute the same percentage (rounded up, if necessary) as persons
designated by Purchaser constitute of the Company Board of (i) each committee
of the Company Board, (ii) the board of directors of each Company Subsidiary,
and (iii) each committee of each such board. The provisions of this Section
7.3 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Purchaser, Parent
or any affiliate of Purchaser or Parent may have (with respect to the election
of directors or otherwise) under applicable Law as a holder or beneficial
owner of Company Shares.

(b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 7.3, including all such actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Purchaser
shall supply to the Company on a timely basis any information with respect to
either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the Company Board,
then until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to
have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date of this
Agreement, including at least two (2) directors who are (i) selected by such
current directors and (ii) independent directors for purposes of the continued
listing requirements of Nasdaq (such directors, the "Independent Directors"),
_provided_ , that, if any Independent Director is unable to serve due to death
or disability or any other reason, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall
be entitled to elect or designate another individual (or individuals) who
serve(s) as a director (or directors) on the date of this Agreement (
_provided_ , that no such individual is an employee of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries) to fill the vacancy, and such director (or directors)
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director (or Independent Directors) for
purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Director then remains, the other
directors shall designate two (2) individuals, _provided_ , that such
individuals shall not be employees, officers, directors or affiliates of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser (or, in the event that there shall be less than
two (2) directors available to fill the vacancies as a result of
such individuals deaths, disabilities or refusals to serve,



 

71  such smaller number of individuals who are directors on the date of this
Agreement) to fill the vacancies and such directors shall be deemed
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Following the Control
Date and prior to the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement by the
Company, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute
the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize) any amendment or termination of this Agreement on
behalf of the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the
performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Purchaser under this
Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements of Parent or
Purchaser or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company and any
other determination with respect to any action to be taken or not taken by or
on behalf of Company or the Company Board relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated hereby that is reasonably likely to adversely impact
the holders of Company Shares. The Independent Directors shall have the
authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company)
at the expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations
hereunder, and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Time, to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms (and such authorization for such
an action shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other
action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director
of the Company, shall be required to authorize such action).

7.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

(a) Upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, from the
date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and
agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford the officers,
employees and other Representatives of Parent and Purchaser reasonable access
at all reasonable times to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary, including the Owned Company Intellectual Property,
and shall furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and
other data and information (including the work papers of the Companys
accountants, subject to the prior written consent of the Companys
accountants) as Parent or Purchaser, through their officers, employees and
other Representatives, may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or
information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, or
(ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material
risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information. In the event
that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding proviso, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate
the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or to waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 7.4 shall be conducted in
a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or unreasonably create a
risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the

 



 

72  Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Any access to any Company Leased
Real Property shall be subject to the terms of the applicable lease agreement
and the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements.

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.4 shall be held confidential in accordance with the Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of April 15, 2010, between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

 

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent in good faith as reasonably
requested by Parent to report material (individually or in the aggregate)
operational developments, material changes in the status of relationships with
customers and potential customers and material changes in the status of
ongoing operations.

 

(d) No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.4 or otherwise shall affect
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement
of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto
or any Tender Offer Condition.

 

7.5 No Solicitation of Transactions.

 

(a) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of the
Control Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall
they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or the making thereof to the
Company or its shareholders; (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any non-
public information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person
(other than Parent, Purchaser and their Representatives) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; (C) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any
provision of any contractual "standstill," confidentiality or similar
obligation of any person other than Parent or its affiliates; or (D) take any
action to render any provision of any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Companys organizational documents, in each case inapplicable
to any person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates) or
any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company
shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have
been heretofore granted to any such person or Acquisition Proposal under any
such provisions). Any breach of the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.5
by any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company.

(ii) The Company immediately shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and shall instruct each of their respective Representatives immediately to,
cease and cause to be terminated any and all discussions or negotiations with
any person that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and request the prompt return or



 

73  destruction of all confidential information provided to any such party prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the Acceptance
Time, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 7.5(a) and
was made after the date hereof, the Company may, subject to compliance with
Section 7.5(c), (x) furnish information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
_provided_ , that all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent prior to or concurrent with the time it is provided
to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding
such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in connection
with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and _provided_ , the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless the Company shall
have provided Parent with at least twenty four (24) hours prior written
notice that it intends to take such action (it being acknowledged and agreed
that the Company shall not be obligated to provide any such prior
written notice prior to (x) furnishing any such information following the
initial delivery of such information in accordance with this Section 7.5(a) or
(y) participating in discussions or negotiations with such person with respect
to any subsequent or amended Acquisition Proposal following the initial
Acquisition Proposal by such person). In addition, notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, to the extent the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, not enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the
sole purpose of allowing the other party to such agreement to submit an
Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to another party that has submitted
an Acquisition Proposal, solely with respect to such submission, that will
constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, that did
not, in each case, result from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.5.

 

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 7.5, made by a Third Party that, if
consummated, would result in such Third Partys (or its shareholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, 100% of the outstanding equity securities of the
Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or

 



 

74  substantially all of the assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole and that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys shareholders
than the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all terms and conditions of
such proposal and of this Agreement, including (1) any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise,
(2) whether the proposal is reasonably capable of being completed by such
Third Party (taking into account, among other things, the expectation of
obtaining required regulatory approvals and all other legal, financial and
other aspects of the proposal and the Third Party making the proposal), and
(3) if financing is required, whether such financing is reasonably
available to the Third Party).

(b) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, until the earlier of the
Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x)
(A) fail to make pursuant to Section 2.2(b), or withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any
manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation"), (B) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer other than the Offer for the
Company Common Stock within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such
offer, (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(C), a "Change
in Recommendation"), or (y) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt
or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)) (any of the foregoing, an "Acquisition
Agreement").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time and solely in response to an Intervening Event, effect a
Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not effect a Change in Recommendation unless the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the facts, circumstances and other conditions giving rise thereto, and
prior to effecting such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, during such seventy-two (72) hour period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board

 



 

75  shall not be permitted to effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 7.5(b)(ii) with respect to or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to Section
7.5(b)(iii)).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may in response to
an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this Section 7.5,
(A) make a Change in Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in
light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to make such
Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach by
the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (B) cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f) and
concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement if the
Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of such Superior
Proposal, that failure to so terminate this Agreement would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds the Fee in accordance
with Section 9.1(f); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f), and any purported
termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force
or effect, unless the Company has:

(A) provided to Parent seventy-two (72) hours prior written notice that it
intends to take such action (a "Notice of Designated Superior Proposal"),
which notice shall describe the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (a "Designated
Superior Proposal") and attach the most current form or draft of any written
agreement providing for the transaction contemplated by such Designated
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Designated Superior Proposal with a new seventy-two
(72) hour notice period),

 

(B) during such seventy-two (72) hour period, if requested by Parent, engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a
Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and

 



 

76 (C) at the end of such seventy-two (72) hour period, such
Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines
in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
(taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or
proposed by Parent in a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of
being accepted by the Company in response to a Notice of Designated Superior
Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required by clause (B) or
otherwise).

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in writing
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of
doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the Company would
reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and
attaching a copy of any such written Acquisition Proposal, or if such
Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to the Company, the Company shall
summarize in writing the terms of such Acquisition Proposal (including for the
avoidance of doubt any such request or other inquiry). The Company shall keep
Parent informed promptly on a current basis in all material respects of the
status and details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board
is expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to
consider providing information to any person or group in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry. The Company shall publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the
commencement of any tender or exchange offer or public announcement or public
notice of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, after receipt of a
written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation, unless a Change in
Recommendation is permitted by Section 7.5(b)(iii).

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to the holders of Company Shares
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law ( _provided_ that each such disclosure shall
include a public reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation), or (ii)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement required
under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that this Section 7.5(d)
shall not be deemed to permit the Companys Board or any committee thereof to
make a Change in Recommendation except as expressly permitted by Section
7.5(b) (it being agreed that any "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
substantially similar communication, and the delivery of a Notice of
Designated Superior Proposal and any amendment or update to such notice and
the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment and public
disclosure with respect thereto shall not, by itself, be deemed to be a Change
in Recommendation).

  

 

77 7.6 Employee Benefits Matters.

 

(a) If so directed by Parent, the Company Board, at least five (5) business
days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, will adopt
resolutions terminating (i) any and all Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code and
(ii) all Plans that are account balance plans providing for deferrals of
compensation at the election of the service provider as described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A) (including without limitation, the
Companys Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan), in each case
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company
becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The termination of the Plans referred
to in clause (ii) above will be effected pursuant to and in accordance with
the Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and
the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such Plans as contemplated by this Section
7.6(a) as Parent may reasonably request.

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent
and/or their respective subsidiaries shall provide the Continuing Employees
with substantially comparable types and levels of employee benefits (excluding
any defined benefit pension plan and equity award, change of control and/or
severance benefits) ("Parent Plans"), as those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Parent. To the extent such employee benefits are provided through
Parent Plans and not the Plans, then for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant under any Parent Plan and to the extent permitted by applicable law
and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule, Parent shall
provide the Continuing Employees with service credit under the Parent Plans
for their period of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, except where doing so would cause a duplication of
benefits. Subject to any required consent of the applicable insurance
provider, if benefits are provided under Parent Plans, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any and all pre-existing condition (or
actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Plan that is a group
health plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents in accordance with applicable laws and, if the Effective
Time occurs on a date other than the last day of a Plan year and such benefits
are provided under Parent Plans, Parent shall provide them with credit for any
co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during
the Plan year including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent
Plan in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in any respect, including in respect of continued employment 



 

78  (or resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Plan or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the Company prior to the
Effective Time), or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment
to any of the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to
employees or other persons prior to or following the Effective Time. Nothing
in this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify
or terminate any such plans or arrangements of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the Company prior to the Effective
Time).

(d) If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts,
amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts
payable under such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be
calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the
Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall
take all actions necessary so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the
adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Company
Arrangement, as well as any payment or benefit to be made thereunder or with
respect thereto, shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the
Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided
pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of
the taking prior to the Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the
Company Board, the Company Compensation Committee or its independent
directors.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of the
termination of employment without cause of any Continuing Employee (excluding
any Company executive officer with an individual employment agreement that
provides severance pay and excluding any person covered by a Company
Management Continuity Agreement), at any moment within the ninety (90)-day
period immediately following the Effective Time, such Continuing Employee
shall be entitled to an amount of severance pay and benefits in accordance
with and subject to the terms of the severance policy of the Company listed on
Schedule 7.6 of this Agreement, less any amount paid under the Companys
Amended and Restated Employee Retention Plan, if any.

 

7.7 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of
expenses or similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
favor of any present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company and any Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnification
Agreements") (and all other indemnification agreements of the Company that are
on terms substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any
indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses



 

79  provisions under the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as in
effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time;  _provided_ , that such
obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under
applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall purchase a pre-paid "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits and coverage levels as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, and
that by its terms shall provide coverage until the sixth annual anniversary of
the Effective Time (the "Tail Policy"); _provided_ , that, in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 7.7(b), the Company shall not pay a lump-sum
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount the Company set forth on Section 7.7 of
the Disclosure Letter. Parent shall cause the Tail Policy (or, if the Tail
Policy becomes unavailable for any reason, a substitute prepaid "tail" policy
on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits and
coverage levels as the Tail Policy, with a term extending for the remainder
of such six-year period) to be in full force and effect for its full term and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Company or, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.7 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

7.8 Compliance with State Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or similar statute or
regulation, shall be or become applicable to such Transactions, the Company,
through the Company Board, will approve the Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger, will amend the Bylaws of the Company, and will take such other actions
as are necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the Transactions contemplated hereby.

7.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made by
the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such
that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(d) of Annex A would not be
satisfied or (x) any failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or
agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the
conditions 



 

80  set forth in clause (iii)(e) of Annex A would not be satisfied; and (ii) the
occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in writing of any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or
Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the failure to so comply or the
becoming untrue or incorrect would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent
or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

7.10 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or
any Transaction. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the others of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is instituted or threatened in
writing against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or Parent or any
of its subsidiaries (including Purchaser), as the case may be, that would have
been listed in Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Letter or Section 5.6 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, if such action, suit, proceeding
or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate at Parents expense in (but not
control) the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation or claims
against the Company or any of its directors relating to the Offer or the
Merger, in each case which seek to prohibit or restrain the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not settle or make an offer to settle
any litigation against the Company or any director by any shareholder relating
to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.11 Consents and Approvals.

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) prepare and file all necessary documentation, (ii) effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act, as more specifically
addressed in Section 7.12) and (iii) obtain all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are
reasonably deemed necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions. The
Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents
required to be listed on Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Letter; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required prior to the Acceptance Time
to pay any consent or other similar fee, "profit sharing" or other similar
payment or other consideration (including increased rent or other similar
payments or any amendments, supplements or other modifications to (or waivers
of) the existing terms of any Contract), or the provision of additional
security (including a guaranty) to obtain the consent, waiver or approval of
any Person under any Contract. The parties hereto shall consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the Transactions. Parent and the Company
shall each, subject to the terms and



 

81  conditions of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and the Company, with respect to
any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

(c) This Section 7.11 is subject to, in all respects, the provisions of
Section 7.12(c) below.

7.12 HSR Act Filing and International Antitrust Notifications.

(a) As promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement (but in no
event later than October 8, 2010), if required by any Law, each of Parent and
the Company (i) shall file with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") a pre-merger notification in accordance with the HSR Act with
respect to the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) shall
file an antitrust notification in any other jurisdiction if required by any
other Antitrust Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall (x) furnish promptly
to the FTC, the Antitrust Division and any other requesting Governmental
Authority any additional information requested by either of them pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other antitrust notification in connection with such
filings, and (y) use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, and to obtain any
required consents under any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Offer
and/or the Merger as soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger under any Antitrust Laws, including
using reasonable best efforts to take all such action as reasonably may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, or any other Governmental Authority or Person may assert under any
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer and/or the Merger.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any filings or
investigations with, by or before any Governmental Authority relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any proceedings
initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or affiliate thereof shall
receive a request for additional information or documentary material from
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement pursuant to the HSR or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to
which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Law, each of



 

82  Parent and the Company (i) shall give each other reasonable advance notice
of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the
Merger, (ii) shall give each other an opportunity to participate in each of
such meetings, (iii) shall keep the other party reasonably apprised with
respect to any oral communications with any Governmental Authority regarding
the Offer or the Merger, and (iv) shall consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings or responses described in
this Section 7.12.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to, and, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not take any
action to and shall not allow any of the Company Subsidiaries to, consent or
proffer to divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or similar
Contract with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or operation of,
any material business or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
no event shall Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to
litigate or participate in the litigation, whether judicial or administrative,
brought by any Governmental Authority or appeal any Order (i) challenging or
seeking to make illegal, delaying materially or otherwise directly or
indirectly restraining or prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates of all or any portion of the business or assets of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or to require
any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or
nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion of the business or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each
case as a result of or in connection with the Offer or the Merger, (iii)
seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose or confirm limitations on the
ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise
full rights of ownership of, any Company Shares or any shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation on all matters properly presented to the
shareholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, respectively, (iv)
seeking to require divestiture by Parent, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries of any Company Shares or any business or assets of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, or (v)
that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the Offer or the Merger or that would reasonably be expected
to dilute materially the benefits to Parent of the Transactions (any of such
actions, a "Burdensome Action").

 

7.13 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) Parent shall take such
actions as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section
3.7 with respect to the assumption and conversion or termination, as the case
may be, of any Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company SARs, the ESPP and
any other convertible securities by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (ii) the Company shall take such actions as may be required
to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 3.7 and any other
dispositions of equity securities or derivative



 

83  equity securities of the Company by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

7.14 Delisting. Each party hereto agrees to cooperate with the other party in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to (i) delist the
Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and (ii) to terminate the registration of the
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such delisting
or termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

7.15 Further Assurances. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in all cases subject to applicable Law and the
terms of Section 7.12(c), each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to cause the Tender Offer
Conditions to be satisfied and cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Section 8 to be satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent or
Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to, or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing, delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
or the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

7.16 Public Announcements. No press release or public announcement, statement
or disclosure concerning the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction shall
be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except (x) as such release or
announcement may be required by Law, including the rules or regulations of
any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange and (y) in connection with any
actions by the Company or the Company Board permitted by Sections 7.5(b) or
7.5(d), in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties agree that
for so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, all press releases or
public announcements, statements or disclosures concerning the Offer, the
Merger or any other Transaction made by (i) the Company shall be made only
with the prior approval of the Chairman of the Executive Committee of its
board of directors or by the board of directors acting together and (ii)
Parent or Purchaser shall be made only with the prior approval of the Chairman
or another the member of its board of directors.

Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

would allow any Person (solely for purposes of this Section 7.18, as defined
in the Company Rights Agreement) to acquire fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the "Common Shares" without being

 



 

84  deemed as a "Beneficial Owner" or "Acquiring Person" (other than Parent,
Purchaser or any subsidiary of Parent) and causing a "Distribution Date," a
"Shares Acquisition Date" or a "Triggering Event" (each as defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) to occur. The Company Board shall not make a
determination that Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates or
associates, directors, officers or employees is a "Beneficial Owner" or an
"Acquiring Person" (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) for
purposes of the Company Rights Agreement. The Company and the Company Board
shall take all action necessary to render the Company Rights inapplicable to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

7.19 Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) Parent and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause to be taken all actions necessary to obtain the Financing on the terms
and subject to the conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including
using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (A) on the terms and subject to the conditions
reflected in the Commitment Letter or (B) on other terms that are acceptable
to Parent and Purchaser and would not materially and adversely impact
the ability of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without delay; (ii) comply without delay with
all covenants, and satisfy without delay all conditions, required to be
complied with or satisfied by Parent or Purchaser in the Commitment Letter
and in such definitive agreements; (iii) cause the Financing to be consummated
at such time or from time to time as is necessary for Parent and Purchaser to
satisfy their respective obligations under this Agreement; (iv) pay any and
all commitment or other fees in a timely manner that become payable by Parent
or Purchaser under the Commitment Letter following the date of this Agreement,
to the extent that the failure to pay such fees would be reasonably expected
to adversely impact the availability of the financing thereunder; provided,
however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent and Purchaser shall
not be required to cause any other person to, commence, participate in, pursue
or defend any Action against or involving any of the persons that have
committed to provide any portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the
Financing. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes or would
reasonably be expect to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any reason or the Commitment Letter
shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent or
Purchaser for any reason, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly so notify the
Company, and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the Outside Date, from
the same and/or alternative financing sources alternative financing on terms
not materially less favorable to Parent and Purchaser than the terms of the
Financing in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) an amount sufficient
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into consideration the funds
otherwise available to Parent and Purchaser), and (ii) the amount of financing
that was contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement.
In the event any alternative or substitute financing is obtained by Parent and
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.19(a) (the
"Alternative Financing"), references in this Agreement to the Financing
(including, for



 

85  avoidance of doubt, the references in this Section 7.19 and Section 1.1, but
excluding references in Section 5.4) shall be deemed to refer to the
Alternative Financing, and if a new financing commitment letter is entered
into in connection with such Alternative Financing (the "New Commitment
Letter"), references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter (including,
for avoidance of doubt, the references in this Section 7.19, but excluding
the references in Section 5.4 and clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) shall
be deemed to refer to the New Commitment Letter. Parent and Purchaser will
provide the Company with a copy of any New Commitment Letter obtained by
Parent or Purchaser in connection with an Alternative Financing as promptly as
practicable following the execution thereof.

 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the Financing, including the
status of Parents and Purchasers efforts to comply with their respective
covenants under, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the Commitment
Letter and shall give the Company prompt notice of any event or change that
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Financing. Neither Parent nor Purchaser
shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, supplement or
otherwise modify, or grant any waivers under, the Commitment Letter in any
manner (including by way of a side letter or other binding agreement,
arrangement or understanding) that would: (A) expand in any material respect,
or amend, supplement or otherwise modify in a manner materially adverse to
Parent and Purchaser, the conditions to the Financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter; (B) prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (C) subject to
Parents and Purchasers right to obtain substitute financing set forth in
Section 7.19(a), reduce the aggregate amount of financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter to an amount below the amount needed (in combination with
all funds held by or otherwise available to Parent and Purchaser) to
consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under
the Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of
the Commitment Letter in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
consummate the Financing without delay.

(c) The Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
the representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide, at
Parents sole cost and expense, all reasonable cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing as may be requested by Parent or Purchaser
and that is necessary or customary or desirable in connection with Parents
and Purchasers efforts to obtain the Financing, including (i) participation
by senior management in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions at times and in locations reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii)
furnishing Parent and Purchaser and their representatives with all financial
and other material information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
including all information contemplated by the Commitment Letter to be
delivered after the date of this Agreement, as is necessary or customary in
connection with the Financing (the "Financing Information"), in each case, as
and when it becomes available; (iii) assisting Parent and its financing
sources in the preparation of syndication documents and materials, information

 



 

86  memoranda, lender presentations and similar documents and materials, in
connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials, collectively,
the "Offering Documents"), including providing customary authorization
letters related thereto, (iv) assisting in the preparation of definitive
financing documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (v)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing, (vi) using
commercially reasonably efforts to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and collateral arrangements, including, without
limitation, customary payoff letters, releases of liens, instruments of
termination or discharge, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance, (vii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts
for the Financing benefit materially from the Companys existing lending and
banking relationships, (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts in
assisting Parent and Purchaser in their efforts to obtain corporate credit or
family ratings of Parent; and (ix) facilitating the consummation of the
Financing, including cooperating with Parent to satisfy the conditions
precedent to the Financing to the extent within the control of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser
to permit the consummation of the Financing; _provided_ that neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or
any other fee in connection with the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall ensure that all financial and
other projections concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are
made available to Parent and Purchaser after the date of this Agreement are
prepared in good faith The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide, and to cause its Company Subsidiaries to provide, the
items set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above no later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the Initial Expiration Date. The Company hereby consents to
the use of its logos in connection with the Financing.

 

(d) Any breach of the Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement with respect
to the Financing, any commitment letter with respect to the Alternative
Financing or any definitive agreement with respect to any Alternative
Financing by Parent, in each case that materially and adversely affects the
ability of Parent or Purchaser to obtain the Financing, shall be deemed a
breach by Parent of this Section 7.19. Each of Parent and Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any
Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing, is a condition to
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independent of the availability of the Financing or any Alternative
Financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the Tender Offer
Conditions and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 8.1. Parent and
Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the Company and its affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility
for, or incur any liability to any person under, any financing that Parent and
Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 7.19 and that,
except in cases involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part
of the Company or any of its affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives, Parent and Purchaser shall, on a joint and several basis,

expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of one or more Tender Offer
Conditions in a circumstance where Purchaser has no further obligation to

the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not
be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the substantial or primary cause of, or resulted in, the
non-satisfaction of any Tender Offer Conditions or the termination or
withdrawal of the Offer pursuant to its terms without any Company Shares being
purchased; or

 

(iii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered (x) any Law that is then in effect
and makes acceptance for payment of, or payment for, the Company Shares or
consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, or (y) any Order
that is then in effect and enjoins Purchaser from accepting for payment, or
paying for, the Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or Parent and the Company
from consummating the Merger, and such Order shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order
vacated; or

(c) By either Parent or Purchaser, if there is an inaccuracy in the Companys
representations herein, or a breach by the Company of its covenants herein, in
either case such that the events set forth in clauses (iii)(d) or (iii)(e) of
Annex A shall have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , if such breach or
inaccuracy is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside
Date and (B) the date that is twenty (20) business days from the date the
Company is notified in writing by Parent of such breach, Parent and Purchaser

this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect that is
continuing (whether or not events or circumstances occurring prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement caused or contributed to the
occurrence of such Material Adverse Effect); or

occurred: (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have made a
Change in Recommendation; (ii) the Company Board shall have failed to

include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit
Parent to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents; (it
being agreed that the delivery of a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal and
any amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver
such notice, update or amendment and public disclosure with respect thereto
shall not, by itself, give rise to a right for Parent to terminate this
Agreement); or

 

(f) By the Company, if there is an inaccuracy in Parents or Purchasers
representations herein, or a breach by Parent or Purchaser of its covenants
herein, in either case that would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to Parents or Purchasers ability to purchase and pay for the Company
Shares (assuming all Company Shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer); _provided_ , _however_ , if such breach or inaccuracy
is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside Date and (B)
the date that is twenty (20) business days from the date Parent is notified
in writing by the Company of such breach, the Company may not terminate the
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(f), (x) prior to such date if Parent
and Purchaser are taking reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy
and (y) following such date if such inaccuracy or breach is cured at or prior
to such date; or

(g) By the Company in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.5(b)(iii);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) the Company shall
pay to Parent the Fee payable under Section 9.3(a)(iv) concurrently with such
termination. Any purported termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) that is
not in strict compliance with the requirements of Section 7.5(b)(iii) and
this Section 9.1(f) shall be null and void and of no effect.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or their
respective officers, directors, shareholders, or affiliates; _provided_ ,
that, (a) Section 7.4(b) (Confidentiality), Section 7.16 (Public
Announcements), Section 9.3 (Fees), Section 10 (General Provisions) and
this Section 9.2 shall remain in full force



 

90  and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, and (b) such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability or damages (which the
parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of costs
or expenses, and may include, to the extent proven, the benefit of the bargain
lost by a partys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party) for any fraud or
breach of its representations or warranties or covenants hereunder. A
termination of this Agreement shall not cause a termination of
the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement between the parties.

9.3 Fees.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) and (x)
an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been publicly announced
after the date hereof and prior to such termination and not publicly withdrawn
prior to such termination and (y) within twelve (12) months after such
termination (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (with
all references to 15% in the definition thereof being treated as references to
50.1% for purposes of this Section 9.3(a)(i));

(ii) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii)
and (x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been publicly
announced after the date hereof and prior to such termination and not publicly
withdrawn prior to such termination and (y) within twelve (12) months after
such termination (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated (with all references to 15% in the definition thereof being
treated as references to 50.1% for purposes of this Section 9.3(a)(ii));

(iii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(e); or

(iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g);

 

(b) then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent a fee of Seventeen
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($17,500,000) (the "Fee"), which amount
shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Fee
shall be paid (x) in the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) above,
promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business days) following the
first to occur of the events giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment, (y) in the circumstances described in clause (iii) above, promptly
(but in no event later than two (2) business days) following such
termination), and (z) in the circumstances described in clause (iv) above,
concurrently with and as a condition to the termination. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not
the Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the
same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.



 

91 (c) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Tender and Support Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates
that the Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which the Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that
the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Transactions,
and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay the Fee when due,
the term "Fee" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred or
accrued by Parent and Purchaser (including fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.3,
together with interest on such unpaid Fee, commencing on the date that the Fee
became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A. from time to time, in the City of New York, as such banks
Base Rate plus 5%.

10\. _General Provisions._

 

10.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company, Parent and Purchaser contained in this Agreement

10.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Tender and Support Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties



 

93  with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the

Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of
law or otherwise), except that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of
their rights hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent so long as
Parent and Purchaser remain liable for all of the obligations contemplated
under this Agreement. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND
PURCHASER, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

10.5 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than (a) following the Effective Time, Section 7.7 (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such persons), (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of
holders of Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company
SARs to pursue claims for damages (including damages based on loss of the
economic benefits of the transaction to such holders) and other relief
(including equitable relief) for any breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Purchaser, whether or not this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant
to Section 9, which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed
by Parent and Purchaser, (c) from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights
of holders of Company Shares to receive the consideration pursuant to the
Offer, as set forth in Section 2, (d) from and after the Effective Time, the
rights of holders of Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and
Company SARs to receive the consideration pursuant to the Merger, as set forth
in Section 3, and (e) Sections 7.19(d), 10.7 and 10.8 (which provisions are
intended to be for the benefit of the persons referred to therein, and may be
enforced by such persons). The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of this
Section 10.5 shall only be enforceable on behalf of holders of Company Shares,
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs by the Company in its
sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, it being understood
and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach to such
Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company SARs and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or
other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims
(net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the
Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in
part, by the Company to the holders of Company Shares, Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and Company SARs of record as of any date determined by the
Company or (B) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company
on behalf of the holders of Company Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
RSUs and Company SARs in any manner the Company deems fit. 



 

94 10.6 Enforcement.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and/or Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or
parties) under this Agreement.

irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
parties agrees hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Action,
cause of Action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against a Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or reliant in any way to the Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than



 

95  the federal and New York State courts located in the City of New York,
Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

 

10.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE

certifications in this Section 10.8.

therein) as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though
made on or as of such date (other than those representations and warranties
that address matters only as of a particular date or only with respect to a
specified period of time, which need only be true and correct as of such date
or with respect to such period), except, in each case, where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in Section 4.3(b) (i), (iv)-(viii) and Section 4.3(c), shall not be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of such representation
and warranty, (C) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in
Sections 4.1(a), 4.2(a) or 4.4 shall not be true and correct in all material
respects as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer as though
made on or as of such date;

(e) the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform in any material
respect any covenants, obligations or agreements of the Company under this
Agreement required to be performed prior to the expiration of the Offer and
such failure shall not have been cured; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that following any extension of the Offer by Purchaser pursuant to either
Section 2.1(e)(i) or Section 2.1(f), the Tender Offer Condition contemplated
by this clause (e) shall be deemed to have been satisfied so long as the
Company shall not have engaged in an Intentional Breach of any of its
covenants, obligations or agreements under this Agreement required to be
performed prior to the expiration of the Offer and such Intentional Breach
shall not have been cured;

 

(f) the Company shall have failed to terminate and cause the release of all
Liens on the Companys assets granted in favor of Wells Fargo, N.A. in
connection with its standby letters of credit for the Companys corporate
headquarters and its voluntary disability insurance policy;

 

(g) the Company shall not have furnished Parent with a certificate dated as of
the date of determination signed on its behalf by either the Companys chief
executive officer or chief financial officer or such other officer serving in
either such capacities to the effect that the conditions set forth in clauses
(iii)(d), (iii)(e) and (iii)(f) of this Annex A shall not have occurred; or

(h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and
subject to the terms of the Agreement and rules and regulations of the SEC,
may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion, 
_provided_ , that the Minimum Condition may not be waived, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time 



 

-ii-  to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. For purposes of
determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, Parent and
Purchaser shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes of its
determination thereof shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, there shall be deemed to be an "Intentional
Breach" by the Company of a covenant, obligation or agreement under this
Agreement only if: (i) such covenant, obligation or agreement is material to
Parent and Purchaser; (ii) the Company shall have willfully breached such
covenant, obligation or agreement, (iii) the breach of such covenant,
obligation or agreement is the substantial or principal cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Financing prior to
the Outside Date for purposes of funding the purchase of Company Shares in
the Offer; and (iv) the Company employee or representative taking the action,
failing to take the action, or authorizing (or failing to authorize) the
action, as the case may be, giving rise to the breach of such covenant,
obligation or agreement shall have had actual knowledge, at the time of the
Companys breach of such covenant, obligation or agreement, that such action
(or failure to act) was a breach of such covenant, obligation or agreement
under this Agreement. 

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
