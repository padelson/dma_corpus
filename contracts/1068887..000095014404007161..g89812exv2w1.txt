Merger; the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for all the obligations and
liabilities of each of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary; any
claim existing or action or proceeding pending by or against the Company
or Acquisition Subsidiary may be enforced as if the Merger had not taken

Company amended and restated as of the Effective Time in substantially the
form set forth in Exhibit A hereto shall be the Certificate of Incorporation

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until duly amended or repealed.   SECTION 1.05. Directors. The
directors of the Acquisition Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or such time as their respective successors are

Acquisition Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation

CONSIDERATION   SECTION 2.01. Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary:  
(a) Capital Stock of Acquisition Subsidiary. Each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition Subsidiary
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Etc. Each
share of Company Capital Stock that is owned by Parent or the Acquisition
Subsidiary or by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c)
Payment of Merger Consideration.   (i) The total amount of consideration to
be paid for all of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock and in respect of all Company Stock Rights shall be One Hundred Fifty
Nine Million Dollars ($159,000,000.00), as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.01(f) below, less Net Indebtedness for Borrowed Money (collectively, the
"Aggregate Merger Consideration"), which shall be paid in cash, without
interest as follows:   (A) Each issued and outstanding share of Series A 
Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the 
"Series A Preferred Stock"), shall be converted into the right to receive  an
amount in cash equal to (1) $100,   3    plus (2) the amount equal to a
yield of 8% on $100 compounded annually and  accrued from the date of
issuance through the Closing Date, to the extent  not yet paid (the "Series A
Payment Amount").   (B) Each issued and outstanding share of Series B 
Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the 
"Series B Preferred Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive  an
amount in cash equal to (1) $100, plus (2) the amount equal to a yield  of 8%
on $100 compounded annually and accrued from the date of issuance  through
the Closing Date (the "Series B Payment Amount"). The Series A  Payment
Amount and the Series B Payment Amount are collectively referred  to as the
"Preferred Payment Amount".   (C) Subject to Section 2.02(a), each issued
and  outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the 
right to receive an amount in cash equal to X (the "Merger Consideration  Per
Common Share"), where   X = (AMC - PPA) + AEP  -----------------  CS +
VCR   and the abbreviations in the equation above have the following
meanings:   AMC = Aggregate Merger Consideration  PPA = Preferred Payment
Amount  AEP = Aggregate exercise price for the Vested Company Stock Rights 
CS = Number of Shares of Company Common Stock  VCR = Number of Vested Company
Stock Rights.   (D) Each Vested Company Stock Right outstanding at the 
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in 
cash as set forth in paragraph (d) below.   (ii) The amount of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to each share of Company Capital Stock or Vested
Company Stock Right pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to as the
"Merger Consideration" with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock or
Vested Company Stock Right.   (iii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01(c), in accordance with Section
2.02.   (d) Stock Rights. At the Effective Time (i) each Vested
Company Stock Right which is then outstanding shall be canceled and (ii)
in consideration of such cancellation, Parent shall pay to the holders of
Vested Company Stock Rights ("Optionholders") an amount in respect of each
Vested Company Stock Right equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration
Per Common Share (subject to any adjustment thereto pursuant to Sections
2.01(e) and 2.01(f))   4   over the exercise price of such Vested
Company Stock Right, if any (such payment to be net of Taxes required by law
to be withheld with respect thereto). No payment shall be made with respect
to any Company Stock Right having an exercise price greater than the Merger
Consideration Per Common Share or with respect to any Company Stock Right
that is not vested, and any such Company Stock Right shall be cancelled
without any right to receive consideration.   (e) Working Capital Escrow.
Parent shall deposit in escrow with the escrow agent identified in the form
of the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.01(e) (the "Working
Capital Escrow Agreement"), Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) (the "Working
Capital Escrow Amount") of the Aggregate Merger Consideration issuable to the
holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for such shares of Company Common
Stock, which amount shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the terms
of such Working Capital Escrow Agreement following the determination of the
Working Capital (as hereinafter defined).   (f) Working Capital
Adjustment.   (i) The parties agree that the determination of the amount of
Aggregate Merger Consideration was based on the Company\'s delivery of
Working Capital at the Closing in the amount of Twelve Million Dollars
($12,000,000.00) (the "Target Working Capital"). Accordingly, no less than
three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare
and deliver to Parent for Parent\'s review an estimated balance sheet
representing the Company\'s good faith estimate of the Working Capital of the
Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date, based on the books
and records of the Company and applied on a basis consistent with the audited
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2003 ("Estimated Working
Capital"). "Working Capital" means the current assets of the Company
(excluding Cash, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Tax benefit
arising out of payments made or accrued by HRA or the Company on or prior to
the Closing Date as a result of (i) payments made to the holders of Vested
Company Stock Rights pursuant to Section 2.01(d) hereof, (ii) bonus or non-
competition payments made to employees and (iii) the write-off of expenses
incurred in connection with indebtedness for borrowed money paid off on the
Closing Date), less the current liabilities of the Company (excluding
the current portion of indebtedness for money borrowed and accrued interest
thereon, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction Expenses
(to the extent not paid), any special bonus or noncompetition payments owing
to employees (other than those provided in the agreements referenced in
the Preamble hereto), regular bonus amounts for employees pro rated through
the Closing Date, all paid time off through the Closing Date, and the items
on Schedule 2.01(f), all of which shall be accrued as of the Closing Date
unless previously paid), calculated in accordance with GAAP.   (ii) If the
Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, then the
Aggregate Merger Consideration will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the amount of such deficiency.   (iii) As promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date, but in any event within forty-five (45) calendar
days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare a working capital statement
of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the audited balance sheet of the
Company at December 31, 2003, (the "Parent Working Capital Statement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing,   5   if Parent, together with its
independent accounting firm, determines that, in order to comply with GAAP,
the Parent Working Capital Statement must be prepared on a basis different
from the audited balance sheet of the Company as December 31, 2003, Parent
shall set forth such changes and the reasons therefor in the Parent Working
Capital Statement and accompanying correspondence. The Shareholder
Representative agrees to provide reasonable assistance to Parent and its
advisors in connection with the preparation of the Parent Working
Capital Statement. Parent shall deliver the Parent Working Capital Statement
to the Shareholder Representative.   (iv) The Shareholder Representative
shall have forty-five (45) calendar days following receipt of the Parent
Working Capital Statement during which to notify the Parent of any dispute of
any item contained in the Parent Working Capital Statement, which notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and the
Shareholder Representative\'s calculation of the final working capital as it
differs from the calculation set forth in the Parent Working Capital
Statement. If the Shareholder Representative does not notify the Parent of
any dispute within such forty-five (45) calendar-day period, the Parent
Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Date
Working Capital Statement (as hereinafter defined). The parties hereto shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute as promptly as possible, and
upon such resolution, the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with the agreement of the parties hereto.   (v)
If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the Parent Working
Capital Statement within fifteen (15) calendar days (or such longer period as
the Parties shall mutually agree in writing) of notice of a dispute from the
Shareholder Representative, the parties shall engage the Atlanta office of
KPMG LLP (the "Arbitrator") to resolve the issues having a bearing on such
dispute and such resolution shall be final and binding on the parties. The
Arbitrator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its work
within thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement. The expenses of
the Arbitrator shall be shared equally by Parent and Shareholders. The
Parent Working Capital Statement as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.01(f) is referred to herein as the "Final Closing Date Working
Capital Statement" and the Working Capital amount stated in the Final Closing
Date Working Capital Statement is referred to herein as the "Final Working
Capital."   (vi) Within ten (10) days after the determination of the Final
Closing Date Working Capital Statement in accordance with this
Section 2.01(f), (w) if the Estimated Working Capital was less than the
Target Working Capital and if Final Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Shareholders shall pay to Parent an
aggregate amount equal to the absolute difference between the Final Working
Capital and the Estimated Working Capital, (x) if the Estimated Working
Capital was less than the Target Working Capital but the Final Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, then the Parent shall
pay to the Shareholders and Optionholders in cash an aggregate amount equal
to the absolute difference between the Final Working Capital and the
Estimated Working Capital, (y) if the Estimated Working Capital was greater
than the Target Working Capital and the Final Working Capital is less than
the Target Working Capital, then the Shareholders shall pay to Parent an
aggregate amount equal to the absolute difference between the Target Working
Capital and the Final Working Capital, and (z) if the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital and the Final
Working Capital is greater than the Target Working   6   Capital, then
Parent shall pay to the Shareholders and Optionholders in cash an aggregate
amount equal to the absolute difference between the Final Working Capital and
the Target Working Capital. Any payments required to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.01(f) by the Shareholders shall initially be made from the Working
Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Working Capital
Escrow Agreement, and (a) if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is
insufficient, payments required to be made pursuant to this Section
2.01(f) by the Shareholders shall be made from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount or (b) if the Indemnification Escrow Amount is not sufficient, the
Shareholders shall pay such deficiency in proportion to their Proportional
Amount, or (c) if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is in excess of the
aggregate amount owed to Parent, any remaining funds in the Working Capital
Escrow Account shall be released promptly to the Shareholder Representative
for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital Stock and Vested Company
Stock Rights.   (vii) Nothing in this Section 2.01(f), including
the preparation of the Final Working Capital Statement or the agreement by
the parties on the Final Working Capital, shall impair the ability of Parent
to rely on the representations and warranties of the Company and HRA or
diminish the indemnification obligations of the Company or HRA set forth in
this Agreement. (g) Shareholder Representative Account. Parent shall pay to
Shareholder Representative out of the Merger Consideration and for the
benefit of holders of the Company Capital Stock, to such account as shall be
specified in writing by the Shareholder Representative, the amount of Three
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000.00) which shall be used by the Shareholder
Representative in its sole discretion to (i) pay any Transaction Expenses
which are not paid or accrued as of the Closing Date, and (ii) to defray,
offset, settle or pay any Liabilities or expenses of the Company or the
Shareholders incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to pay out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees
and expenses of advisers, incurred by the Shareholder Representative in its
capacity as such. At such time as the Shareholder Representative shall
determine, in its sole discretion, that it no longer needs to hold funds for
the purposes set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Shareholder
Representative shall distribute any remaining amounts received under this
Section 2.01(g) to the holders of the Company\'s Common Stock in proportion
to the consideration received by each such person for his Company Common
Stock. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall have no liability
or responsibility to the holders of Company Capital Stock with respect to
this Section 2.01(g).   SECTION 2.02. Payment Procedures.   (a) Payment
Procedure. Immediately after the Effective Time, each holder of record of
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, as represented in the stock
records of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares
of Company Capital Stock were converted into the right to
receive consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), shall receive from the
Surviving Corporation, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, the consideration as set forth in Section 2.01(c). Immediately
after the Effective Time, each holder of record of a Vested Company Stock
Right whose Vested Company Stock Rights were converted into the right to
receive consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(d), shall receive from the
Surviving Corporation, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, the   7   consideration (net of Taxes required by law to be
withheld with respect thereto) as set forth in Section 2.01(d). The
consideration otherwise payable to holders of Company Common Stock and Vested
Company Stock Rights shall be reduced by the amount payable pursuant to
Section 2.01 (e). The consideration otherwise payable to holders of Company
Common Stock shall also be reduced by the amount payable pursuant to Sections
9.02(b) and 2.01 (g). Merger Consideration shall be paid to holders of
Company Capital Stock and Vested Company Stock Rights by mailing a check to
such address as the Company shall specify in writing to Parent at least five
(5) business days prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of a holder who
receives at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) of Aggregate Merger
Consideration, by wire transfer to such account as may be specified by the
Company to Parent within such time period).   (b) No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Capital Stock; Transfer Books. The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any
shares of Company Capital Stock or Vested Company Stock Rights shall be

Company Benefit Plans that are "employee pension plans" (as defined in

to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not a party to or subject
to any order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment or other restriction of any
Governmental Entity.   SECTION 4.20. Compliance with Laws. Each of the

customers and suppliers. None of the Company\'s or HRA\'s customers or
suppliers have indicated to the Company or HRA that they do not intend to

Knowledge, has there been any adverse change in the Company\'s or HRA\'s

private non-governmental programs, including without limitation any private
insurance program, under which the Company or HRA directly or indirectly is
presently receiving payments (collectively (i) and (ii), the "Payors"), all
of which are listed on Schedule 4.22. The Company and HRA possess all
Certifications necessary to enable them to carry on their operations as
presently conducted and for the Company and HRA to receive reimbursement from
the Payors. Neither the Company nor HRA has ever been excluded, sanctioned,
disciplined, or suffered any material adverse compliance action, with respect
to any of the Certifications or with respect to their respective
participation in the Payors\' programs, nor has there been any decision not
to renew any provider or third-party Payor agreement. There are no pending
or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened actions, investigations
or circumstances, nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, is there a basis for any
action, investigation or circumstance which would adversely affect the
Certifications, or the participation or renewal of participation in any
Payors\' program. True, complete and correct copies of all surveys of the
Company and HRA or their predecessors in interest and conducted in connection
with any Payor\'s program or licensing or accrediting body during the past
two (2) years have been made available to Parent.   (b) Each of the Company

notice, report or other filing with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not
limited to, change in ownership filings in connection with Medicare or
Medicaid provider or supplier status. No waiver, consent, approval or
authorization of any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.24.
Inspections and Investigations. Neither the right of the Company or HRA, nor,
to the Knowledge of the Company, the right of any licensed professional or
other individual affiliated with the Company or HRA, to
receive reimbursements pursuant to any Payor\'s program has been terminated
or otherwise adversely affected as a result of any investigation or action,
whether by any Governmental Entity or other third party. Neither the Company
or HRA, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any licensed professional or
other individual affiliated with the Company or HRA or who has provided
services to the Company or HRA during the past three (3) years, has been the

may reasonably require to effectuate the terms of this Agreement.  
39    ARTICLE IX   SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION   SECTION 9.01. Survival
Past Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Claims Period" shall be the
period during which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this
Agreement by an Indemnitee. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall
begin on the date hereof and terminate as follows:   (a) with respect to
Losses incurred by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation arising under Section 9.02(a)(i) with respect to any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03,
4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04 or 4.16, (collectively, the "Surviving
Representations"), the Claims Period shall continue until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations;   (b) with respect to Losses incurred
by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation arising under
Section 9.02(a)(i) with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty in Sections 4.13, 4.22, 4.23, 4.24, 4.25, 4.26, or
4.28 the Claims Period shall terminate on the date which is four years after
the Closing Date; and   (c) with respect to all other Losses arising under
Section 9.02(a)(i) or 9.03(a) of this Agreement, the Claims Period shall
terminate on the earlier of (i) October 31, 2005 or (ii) the completion by
Parent and its independent auditors of Parent\'s audited financial statements
for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2005.   SECTION 9.02. Indemnification
by the Shareholders.   (a) Subject to Section 9.04 below, the holders of the
Company Common Stock shall severally, but not jointly, in the proportions
described in Section 9.02(b) below, indemnify, defend and hold Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, subsidiaries and Affiliates harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, diminution in
value, claims, fines, penalties, costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees (collectively,
"Losses") incurred by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, subsidiaries or affiliates, arising out of or resulting from:   (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or such
Shareholder contained in this Agreement or in any Schedule hereto or other
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto and the items referred to
in such representations or warranties or schedules as having been delivered
or made available to Parent(without regard to any dollar amount
or qualifications or limitations regarding materiality or Material Adverse
Effect contained therein); or   (ii) the nonperformance of any covenant or
obligation to be performed by the Company or such Shareholder under this
Agreement or other document delivered pursuant hereto.   40    (b)
Parent shall deposit in escrow with the escrow agent identified in the form
of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 9.02(b)
(the "Indemnification Escrow Agreement") Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($7,500,000.00) (the "Indemnification Escrow Amount") of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration issuable to the holders of Company
Common Stock, which amount shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of such Indemnification Escrow Agreement. Any payments required to be
made by the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article IX shall
initially be made from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with
the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be held in escrow until the later of (i) the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, and (ii) the first to occur of (x) the completion by
Parent and its independent auditors of Parent\'s audited financial statements
for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, and (y) October 31, 2005. If the
Indemnification Escrow Amount is insufficient to satisfy the obligations of
the holders of Company Common Stock under this Article IX or if the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement has terminated, then those holders of
Company Common Stock who are Shareholders shall pay to Parent in cash an
amount equal to the excess of such Losses over the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, multiplied by their Proportional Amount. For each Shareholder, the
"Proportional Amount" shall equal a ratio, the numerator of which is the
consideration received for the total shares of Common Stock held by such
Shareholder and the denominator of which is the aggregate
consideration received by all Shareholders for all Shares of Common Stock
held by all Shareholders.   SECTION 9.03. Indemnification by Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold the Shareholders and their respective
Affiliates harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred by any of
the Shareholders or their Affiliates arising out of or resulting from (a) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary contained in this Agreement or other document delivered pursuant
hereto (without regard to any dollar amount or qualifications or limitations
regarding materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained therein), and/or
(b) the nonperformance of any covenant or obligation to be performed by
Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary under this Agreement or other document
delivered pursuant hereto.   SECTION 9.04. Limitation on
Indemnification.   (a) Deductible. Neither the Shareholders, on one side,
nor Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, on the other
side, shall be obligated to indemnify the other party or parties against any
Losses under Sections 9.02(a)(i) or 9.03(a), respectively, until Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation, on one side, or the
Shareholders, on the other side, have incurred aggregate Losses in excess of
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the "Deductible"). At such time as the
aggregate Losses incurred by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Surviving
Corporation, on one side, or the Shareholders, on the other side, shall
exceed the Deductible, such party shall be entitled to receive the amount of
its Losses in excess of the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims
for Losses arising under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04,
5.01 and 5.02 shall not be subject to, and shall not count against, the
Deductible.   (b) Liability Cap. Neither the Shareholders, on one side,
nor Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, on the other
side, shall be obligated to   41   indemnify the other party or parties
against any Losses under Sections 9.02(a)(i) or 9.03(a), respectively, in
excess of Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00) in the aggregate (the
"Cap"); provided that the Losses covered by the Deductible shall not apply
against the Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum liability of the
Shareholders for a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4.02 shall be the aggregate Merger Consideration received by the
Shareholders.   (c) Several Liability of the Shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for obligations
pursuant to this Article IX in excess of the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
the Shareholders shall only be severally liable for their Proportional Amount
of such additional payment; provided that (x) the Summit Funds shall be
jointly and severally liable with respect to each other for their aggregate
Proportional Amount, and (y) each individual Shareholder shall be jointly and
severally liable with respect to any other Shareholder that constitutes
either a family member or a trust that has been created for the benefit of
such Shareholder or his or her family members, which relationships are set
forth on Schedule 9.04(c), for their aggregate Proportional Amount.   (d)
Prior Adjustment. Any indemnification obligation for any amount which has
already been included in an adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration
in accordance with Sections 2.01(f) and (g) hereof shall be reduced by the
amount of such adjustment.   SECTION 9.05. Exclusive Remedy. From and after
the Closing Date, the provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for monetary damages arising out of or resulting from the
breach of any representations, warranties or covenants made pursuant to this
Agreement, except for intentional breach, intentional misrepresentation or
fraud by the Shareholders or the Company against the Parent or the
Acquisition subsidiary in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.  
SECTION 9.06. Indemnification Procedures.   (a) If Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, on one side, or the Shareholders, on
the other side, shall, after the Closing Date, become aware of any matter
which such party, or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
subsidiaries or Affiliates (any of the foregoing, an "Indemnitee") has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall promptly give the indemnifying party or
parties (the "Indemnitor") written notice of such claim (provided that
Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation shall only be
required to provide written notice to the Shareholder Representative),
stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of computation
thereof, all with reasonable particularity and including documentary proof,
if available, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement
in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises;
provided, however, that failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve
the Indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of the claim,
except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by
such failure. All claims for indemnification under this Article IX must be
made no later than thirty (30) days following the termination of the
applicable Claims Period.   42    (b) If an Indemnitee shall receive
notice of any claim by a third party which is or may be subject to
indemnification, the Indemnitee shall promptly give the Indemnitor written
notice of such claim (provided that Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to provide written notice to the
Shareholder Representative); provided, however, that failure to so notify the
Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any liability which it may
have on account of the claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have
been prejudiced by such failure. In such event, the Indemnitee shall permit
the Indemnitor, at its option, to participate in the defense of such third-
party claim by counsel of its own choice and at its own expense. If, however,
the Indemnitor acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder against all Losses that may result from such claim and
the Indemnitee is reasonably satisfied that the Indemnitor has sufficient
funds available to pay any Losses resulting from such claim and will pay any
such Losses, then the Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its option, to assume
and control the defense of such claim by counsel of its own choice and at its
own expense, provided that the Indemnitor and its counsel shall proceed
with diligence and good faith with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such claim or proceeding and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be at the expense of such Indemnitor if: (i) the Indemnitor has failed to
promptly assume the defense and employ counsel or (ii) the named parties to
any such claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include such
Indemnitee and any Indemnitor, and such Indemnitee shall have been advised by
its counsel that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and
such Indemnitee with respect to such claim or proceeding or with respect to
any legal defense which may be available; provided, however, that the
Indemnitor shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the fees and
expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with any
claim or proceeding; provided further, that the Indemnitor shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel as incurred.   (c) In the
event the Indemnitor exercises its right to undertake the defense of any
claim by a third party, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in
such defense and make available to the Indemnitor witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in its possession or under its control
relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Indemnitor. Similarly, in
the event the Indemnitee is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any claim by a third party, the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the
Indemnitee in such defense and make available to the Indemnitee witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its
control relating thereto as are reasonably requested by the Indemnitee. No
claim by a third party may be settled by the Indemnitor without the written
consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; provided, however, that the Indemnitor may settle such claim
without the consent of the Indemnitee so long as the settlement (x) includes
an unconditional release of the Indemnitee, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, from the claim by the third-party claimant
and (y) does not impose any liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitee. No
claim by a third party which is being defended in good faith by the
Indemnitee alone, or jointly with the Indemnitor, shall be settled by
the Indemnitee without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the Indemnitee
may settle such claim without the consent of the Indemnitor so long as the
settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitor, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, from the claim by
the Indemnitee and the third-party claimant and (y) does not impose any
liabilities or obligations on the Indemnitor.   43    SECTION 9.07.
Reduction in Purchase Price.   (a) Any indemnification amounts payable under
this Agreement shall be calculated after giving effect to any Tax benefits
realized by the indemnified party and insurance recovery (net of deductibles
and costs of recovery) to the parties resulting from the Loss that is the
subject of the indemnity; provided, that (i) such indemnified party is not
subject to retroactive adjustments or other reimbursements of its insurance
in respect of such proceeds; provided, further, that the pendency of any
insurance recovery shall not delay or reduce the obligation of the Indemnitor
to make indemnification payments hereunder and if insurance proceeds are
subsequently received by the Indemnitee such proceeds shall be promptly paid
over to the Indemnitor to the extent of any indemnification payments made;
(ii) such insurance recovery shall not reduce any indemnification payment
otherwise required hereunder to the extent that such recovery would void or
vitiate the underlying insurance coverage; and (iii) any dispute relating to
the amount of Tax benefits claimed to reduce any such indemnification amounts
shall be resolved by the Arbitrator pursuant to the same procedures outlined
in Section 2.01(f)(v).   (b) In the event the Shareholders are required to
make an indemnification payment hereunder, the amount of any such payment
shall be deemed to be a reduction in the purchase price paid and received
under this Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any consequential, special or punitive damages of such other
Person.   ARTICLE X   TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT   SECTION 10.01. Events
of Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing
Date:   (a) At the election of the Company or Parent on or after August
3, 2004, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on
such date, provided that the terminating party is not in material default of
any of its obligations hereunder, and provided further that such date shall
be automatically extended for (x) an additional forty-five (45) days after
August 3, 2004 as may be needed to satisfy the conditions to Closing relating
to the expiration of the waiting period or early termination being granted
under the HSR Act, and (y) an additional thirty (30) days after August 3,
2004 as may be needed to satisfy the conditions to Closing relating to
securing governmental consents or approvals other than under the HSR Act, it
being acknowledged and understood that in the case of both clause (x) and (y)
all conditions to Closing set forth herein must still be satisfied or waived
on or prior to the date to which such date is extended;   (b) by mutual
written consent of the Company and Parent; or   (c) by the Company or Parent
if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable Order of a Governmental
Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;  
44    (d) by Parent (provided that neither Parent nor
Acquisition Subsidiary are then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement), if the
Company or the Shareholders materially breach any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and such
breach has not been cured within 20 days following notice of such breach;  
(e) by the Company (provided that neither the Company nor the Shareholders
are then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement), if Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary materially breaches any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and such
breach has not been cured within 20 days following notice of such breach;  
SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. In the event that any party shall elect
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any provision contained
herein expressly giving such party the right to terminate this Agreement,
this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and have no further effect, and
neither party shall have any further obligation or liability (except with
respect to those provisions hereof which expressly survive any termination of
this Agreement including, without limitation, Section 6.06 and Section
12.01). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to any provision hereof shall not relieve any party of any liability
for a breach of any representation or warranty, or nonperformance of any
covenant or obligation hereunder, and any such termination shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any available remedy for any such breach or
nonperformance. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary agree to return to the Company all information
(including but not limited to financial information, sales information,
marketing information and operational information) provided by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. At
the request of Parent, a copy of all such material shall be provided to
counsel for the Company who shall make such material reasonably available to
the parties hereto solely for enforcing their rights under
this Agreement.   SECTION 10.03. Delay of Closing. In the event of a
suspension of trading in securities on The New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ,
or a banking moratorium or suspension of payments in respect of banks across
the United States, any limit by a governmental entity on the extension of
credit by banks generally or other lending institutions generally, or any
national or international hostilities which materially and adversely affect
the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions, then,
notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith (x) an appropriate delay of the Closing of up to
twenty (20) days (the "Delay Period") in order to allow either party to
complete any action that was delayed as a result of the event or events
described above; provided, however, that in the event the Parent delays the
Closing solely pursuant to this Section 10.03, the Closing condition in
Section 7.01 (f), and that in Section 7.01 (b) as it relates to the
representation contained in Section 4.08 (a) shall no longer serve as
conditions to Parent\'s obligations to consummate the Closing except insofar
as Section 7.01(f) was not satisfied or Section 4.08(a) was breached as of a
date prior to any such delay, even if such fact is discovered by Parent after
any such delay.   45    ARTICLE XI   NOTICES   Any notice required or

V, L.P., Attn: Robert V. Walsh, as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact (the "Shareholder Representative") of such shareholder with full powers
of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such shareholder with
respect to the performance on behalf of such shareholder under terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement (the "Shareholder Documents"), as the
same may be from time to time amended, and to do or refrain from doing all
such further acts and things, and to execute all such documents, as the
Shareholder Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated under this Shareholder Documents,
including, without limitation, the power to:   (a) act for the shareholders
with respect to all matters referred to in the Shareholder Documents,
including all adjustments to the Aggregate Merger Consideration and all
indemnification matters set forth herein and the right to compromise or
settle any such claims on behalf of the shareholders;   (b) amend or waive
any provision of the Shareholder Documents (including any condition to
Closing) in any manner which does not differentiate among the
shareholders;   (c) employ and obtain the advice of legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors as the Shareholder
Representative, in his or her sole discretion, deems   49   necessary or
advisable in the performance of his or her duties as the Shareholder
Representative and rely on their advice and counsel;   (d) incur any
expenses, liquidate and withhold assets received on behalf of the
shareholders prior to their distribution to the shareholders to the extent of
any amount which the Shareholder Representative deems necessary for payment
of or as a reserve against expenses, and pay such expenses or deposit the
same in an interest-bearing bank account established for such purpose;  
(e) receive all notices, communications and deliveries hereunder on behalf of
the shareholders under the Shareholder Documents; and   (f) do or refrain
from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the shareholders which the
Shareholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate, in his or her sole
discretion, relating to the subject matter of the Shareholder Documents as
fully and completely as any of the shareholders could do if personally
present and acting and as though any reference to the shareholders in the
Shareholder Documents were a reference to the Shareholder Representative.  
(g) The appointment of the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any other person may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any actions of
the Shareholder Representative as the acts of the shareholders in all
matters referred to in the Shareholder Documents. Each shareholder hereby
ratifies and confirms all that the Shareholder Representative shall do or
cause to be done by virtue of such Shareholder Representative\'s appointment
as Shareholder Representative of such shareholder. The Shareholder
Representative shall act for the shareholders on all of the matters set forth
in the Shareholder Documents in the manner the Shareholder Representative
believes to be in the best interest of the shareholders, but the Shareholder
Representative shall not be responsible to any shareholder for any loss or
damage any shareholder may suffer by reason of the performance by the
Shareholder Representative of such shareholder Representative\'s duties under
the Shareholder Documents, other than loss or damage arising from willful
misconduct or bad faith in the performance of such Shareholder
Representative\'s duties under the Shareholder Documents. Each of
the shareholders hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that the
Shareholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such
shareholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
shareholders, and that any person shall be entitled to rely on any and all
action taken by the Shareholder Representative under the Shareholder
Documents without liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any of the
shareholders. If the Shareholder Representative resigns or ceases to function
in such capacity for any reason whatsoever, then the successor Shareholder
Representative shall be the person which the shareholders appoint; provided,
however, that if for any reason no successor has been appointed within thirty
(30) days, then any shareholder shall have the right to petition a court of
competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor Shareholder
Representative. The shareholders do hereby jointly and severally agree to
indemnify and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless from and against
any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense (including without
limitation attorneys\' fees) reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of
the performance of such Shareholder Representative\'s duties under
the Shareholder Documents except for willful misconduct or bad faith.  
50    SECTION 12.15. Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern
the allocation of responsibility as between Parent and the Company and
the Shareholders for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:   (a)
Filing of Returns. Parent shall, at its expense, prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax returns for the Company for
all periods ending on or prior to or including the Closing Date that are due
after the Closing Date and all other Tax returns due after the Closing Date.
Parent shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative at least 20 days prior
to the time for filing, and permit the Shareholder Representative to review
and comment on, all Tax returns required to be filed for the Company for any
period for which the Shareholders may have an indemnification
obligation under this Agreement for Taxes, and shall make such revisions to
such Tax returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder
Representative. Such Tax returns shall be prepared consistent with past
practices (unless such practices are not permitted by applicable law).  
(b) Tax Assistance and Cooperation. The Shareholder Representative on the one
hand, and Parent and the Company, on the other, shall cooperate (and cause
their affiliates to cooperate) with each other and with each other\'s agents,
including accounting firms and legal counsel, in connection with Tax matters
relating to the Company, including (A) preparation and filing of Tax returns,
(B) determining the liability and amount of any Taxes due or the right to and
amount of any refund of Taxes, (C) examinations of Tax returns, and (D) any
administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes assessed
or proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation shall include each party making
all information and documents in its possession relating to the Company
available to the other party. The parties shall retain all Tax returns,
schedules and work papers, and all material records and other documents
relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including, to the extent notified by any party, any extension
thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax returns and other documents and
information relate. Each of the parties shall also make available to the
other party, as reasonably requested and available, personnel (including
officers, directors, employees and agents) responsible for preparing,
maintaining, and interpreting information and documents relevant to Taxes,
and personnel reasonably required as witnesses or for purposes of providing
information or documents in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceedings relating to Taxes. In the event that the Shareholder
Representative exercises its right to undertake the defense of any Tax claim,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate with the Shareholder Representative
and shall provide the Shareholder Representative with access to tax returns,
books and records and other relevant information and shall execute any
necessary powers of attorney relevant to the Shareholder
Representative\'s authority hereunder.   (c) Tax Refunds. If Parent, the
Company or HRA receives a refund (or otherwise utilizes an overpayment,
including by means of a credit against Tax) with respect to any Taxes for
which any Shareholder has an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
9.02, then Parent, the Company or HRA, as applicable, shall reduce the amount
of any indemnification obligation that would have been owed by any
Shareholder pursuant to Section 9.02 with respect to Taxes by the amount of
such refund (or the amount of such overpayment); provided, however, that (w)
such indemnification obligation shall not be reduced by the amount of any
such refund or overpayment to the extent that the amount of such refund or
overpayment does not exceed the Tax-Related Deductible Amount (as defined
below); (x) subject to the netting of Tax benefits   51   under Section
9.07(a), if such refund, credit or other overpayment is allowed following the
payment of an indemnity obligation with respect to Taxes by or on behalf of
the Shareholders, the amount of the refund, credit or overpayment (to the
extent it exceeds the Tax-Related Deductible Amount) shall be remitted to the
Shareholders (up to the aggregate amount of the Tax-related
indemnity payments previously made by the Shareholders); and (y) if such
refund, credit or other overpayment is subsequently disallowed or
redetermined, the Shareholders shall repay promptly to Parent, the Company or
HRA, as applicable, the amount of any such reduction which previously was
received by such Shareholders (or was applied to offset the indemnity
obligation of such Shareholders) to the extent attributable to such
disallowed or redetermined refund, credit or overpayment, without interest.
For purposes of this Section 12.15(c), "Tax-Related Deductible" shall mean an
amount equal to the amount by which any indemnity obligation of the
Shareholders with respect to Taxes shall have been reduced by reason of the
application of Section 9.04(a).   SECTION 12.16. Employee Benefit Matters.
For purposes of any employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement maintained
by the Parent or the Company for the employees of the Company or HRA on and
after the Closing Date, any years of eligibility service or vesting service
credited to the such employees under the Company\'s employee benefit plans,
programs, or arrangements as of the Closing Date shall be treated as
eligibility or vesting service under the Parent\'s or Company\'s plans,
programs, and arrangements, except to the extent the consent of a third party
is required and cannot be obtained by Parent after having used reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain any such consent.   SECTION 12.17. Effect of
Investigation. Neither the representations and warranties of the Shareholders
nor those of the Company shall be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary
(whether before, on or after the date hereof or before, on or after the
Closing Date), including, but not limited to, any investigation by any of
Parent\'s or Acquisition Subsidiary\'s advisors, consultants
or representatives, or by reason of the fact that Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary or any of such advisors, consultants or representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is or might be
inaccurate. The rights and remedies of any party based upon, arising out of
or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or failure to fulfill any condition shall in
no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other
state of facts upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based
may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.
