If the claim is for indemnification with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or demand at any time instituted or asserted against, or made upon, the Claimant by or on the behalf of any Person other than the Seller Entities (a "Third Party Claim"), the Claimant will give prompt written notice to the Indemnitor of the institution, assertion or making of the Third Party Claim and the nature thereof.  Upon delivery of such notice the claim specified therein shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of this Agreement.  The Indemnitor shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, give written notice to the Claimant as to whether or not the Indemnitor accepts the responsibility to indemnify Claimant with respect to the Third Party Claim.  If the Indemnitor accepts the responsibility to indemnify the Claimant with respect to the Third Party Claim, the Claimant will then grant to the Indemnitor authority, and the Indemnitor will proceed, at its sole expense, to cure, defend, compromise or settle the Third Party Claim in the name of the Claimant; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that (i) any such defense of the Third Party Claim shall be conducted by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant, (ii) the Indemnitor shall not enter into any final compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Claimant, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) the Indemnitor shall not negotiate or otherwise agree to any final compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim that would impose on the Claimant any future obligations, monetary or injunctive, or impose on the Real Property any restriction on future uses of such property.

Upon delivery of such notice the claim specified therein shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of this Agreement.
