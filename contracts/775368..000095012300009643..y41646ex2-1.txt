PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 18, 2000 (together with the Schedules,
Annexes and Exhibits hereto, this "Agreement"), by and among ABN AMRO North
America Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"), Alleghany
Asset Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Alleghany
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Stockholder") and the beneficial
and record owner of one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company (the "Company Stock").   W I T N E S S E T H
:  - - - - - - - - - -   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Purchaser
and the Stockholder have each determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective stockholders for a to-be-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Purchaser incorporated in the State of Delaware ("Newco") to be merged
with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; and   WHEREAS, the Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
as set forth in this Agreement;   NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration
of the foregoing premises, the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   PURCHASE AND SALE   Section 1.1 The
Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Newco shall be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), and the separate corporate existence of Newco
shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation"). Upon becoming effective, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Newco and the Company shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Newco
and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue its
corporate existence under the DGCL.   Section 1.2 The Closing. The closing
(the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take
place at the offices of Dewey  10 Ballantine LLP, 1301 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10019, on the third business day after all of
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under Articles IV and V have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where
permitted, waiver of those conditions), or at such time and place as shall be
mutually agreed to by the parties (the "Closing Date"), but in no event shall
the Closing Date be a date earlier than January 1, 2001.   Section 1.3
Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
Certificate of Merger with respect to the Merger in such form as is required
by the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed
and acknowledged and thereafter filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective at the later of the time of filing of the Certificate
of Merger or at such time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").   Section 1.4 The
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws of Newco as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  
Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Newco immediately prior
to the Effective Time and the officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected
and qualified in accordance with applicable law.   Section 1.6 Effect on
Company Stock; Merger Consideration Adjustment.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Purchaser, Newco, the Company, the Stockholder or the Surviving Corporation,
the shares of the Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $825,000,000 in
cash in the aggregate (the "Merger Consideration"), and each share of capital
stock of Newco shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger
Consideration shall be delivered to the Stockholder by wire transfer of
immediately available funds at the Closing in exchange for certificates
representing all outstanding shares of the Company Stock. As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist.   (b) If
the Asset Quotient (as defined below) is less than 0.90, then the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of the
Adjustment Factor (as defined below) multiplied by Seven Hundred Twenty-Five
Million Dollars ($725,000,000).   -2-  11  (c) The following terms as used
in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:   (i) The term "Asset
Quotient" shall mean the number  (rounded to five decimal places) which
results from dividing MandC;  AUM by the Base Amount.   (ii) The term
"Adjustment Factor" shall mean:   (1) if the Asset Quotient is less than 0.9
but equal  to or greater than 0.8, the amount by which the Asset  Quotient
is less than 0.9, or   (2) if the Asset Quotient is less than 0.8, 0.1
plus  two times the amount by which the Asset Quotient is less  than
0.8;   provided, however, that the Adjustment Factor shall under no 
circumstances be greater than 0.3.   (iii) The term "MandC; AUM" shall mean
the aggregate market  value at 4:00 p.m. Atlanta time on the date that is ten
(10)  business days prior to the Closing Date of assets of the  Consenting
Clients (as defined below) under the management of  Montag and Caldwell, Inc.
("MandC;"), as adjusted to eliminate  increases or decreases attributable
exclusively to positive or  negative changes in the market value of such
assets since the  date hereof or the date such assets came under MandC;\'s
management.  For the avoidance of doubt, the MandC; AUM shall be calculated
as  follows:   (1) assets of the Consenting Clients that are under 
MandC;\'s management as of the date hereof shall be valued at  the fair market
value of such assets as of the date  hereof;   (2) assets of the Consenting
Clients that come under  MandC;\'s management after the date hereof shall be
valued at  the fair market value of such assets as of the date that  they
came under MandC;\'s management; and   (3) assets of the Consenting Clients
that are acquired  directly or indirectly with the proceeds of sales of 
assets described in clauses (1) or (2) above (including  indirectly through
multiple sales) shall be valued on the  basis of the value of such sold
assets as provided in  clauses (1) and (2) above as if no sale of the
assets  described in clauses (1) and (2) above had taken place.   (iv) The
term "Base Amount" shall mean $28,991,198,352,  which is the aggregate market
value as of 4:00 p.m. Atlanta time  on October 16, 2000 of assets under
MandC;\'s management.   -3-  12  (v) The term "Consenting Clients" shall
refer to the Funds  and the Non-Fund Clients (together with entities that
become  such after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing 
Date) that shall have consented to the assignment of their  Client Contracts
in accordance with the requirements of the  Investment Company Act, the
Advisers Act, other Applicable Laws  or such Client Contracts, which consent
shall have been  evidenced as follows: (i) with respect to each of the Funds,
the  approval by the shareholders thereof, and with respect to the 
Enterprise Funds, the approval of the boards of trustees  thereof, of a new
investment advisory agreement or sub-advisory  agreement, as the case may be
(a "New Advisory Contract"), with  the Subsidiary which acts as the
investment advisor or  sub-advisor thereof on the same terms (other than the
term  thereof) as the existing investment advisory agreement between  such
parties, to take effect at the Closing; (ii) with respect  to each Non-Fund
Client whose Client Contract requires a written  consent to the assignment of
such Client Contract, a written  consent; (iii) with respect to each Non-Fund
Client whose Client  Contract permits an assignment after notice of an
impending  assignment to such Non-Fund Client and no receipt by the Company 
or any of its Subsidiaries of any communication that such  Non-Fund Client
objects to such assignment or terminates or  intends to terminate its Client
Contract, a notice delivered to  such Non-Fund Client at least sixty (60)
days prior to the  Closing and the receipt of a written consent from such
Non-Fund  Client, or no receipt, as certified by an officer of the  Company,
of any communication that such Non-Fund Client objects  to such assignment or
terminates or intends to terminate its  Client Contract; and (iv) with
respect to each Non-Fund Client  whose Client Contract is not subject to the
Investment Company  Act or the Advisers Act, satisfaction of the requirements
of  other Applicable Laws and such Client Contract for an  assignment, if
any, as certified by an officer of the Company.   (vi) Any reference to
assets being "under management"  shall mean assets with respect to which the
manager thereof  serves as investment advisor or sub-advisor, and not merely
in a  capacity as administrator, custodian, trustee, fiduciary or  similar
capacity, and assets held and managed in a common or  collective trust as to
which a trust company serves as trustee.   Section 1.7 Employment
Agreements. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the employment agreements in the forms set forth in Exhibit 1.7 hereto
between the Company and each of the parties thereto shall be executed and
delivered (the "Employment Agreements").   Section 1.8 Post-Closing
Payment.   (a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Stockholder shall
prepare a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as
of the time   -4-  13 immediately preceding the Effective Time (which
shall take into account all transactions contemplated to take place on the
Closing Date pursuant to Exhibit 7.10) in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied and consistent with past practice,
except for the absence of footnote disclosures and other financial statements
required thereby and except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement (as it
may be audited or changed below, the "Closing Date Balance Sheet").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not
include the current provision for Income Taxes or any current Income Tax
liabilities. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be audited by KPMG LLP at
the expense of the Stockholder and, as so audited, shall be issued and
delivered to the Stockholder and the Purchaser within 60 days after the
Closing Date. Total assets less total liabilities as shown on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date
Book Value."   (b) During the preparation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet by the Stockholder as provided in Section 1.8(a) hereof, the Purchaser
shall (i) provide the Stockholder and its representatives with reasonable
access to all relevant books, records, work papers and employees of the
Company, (ii) cooperate with the Stockholder and its representatives,
including the provision of all information necessary or useful in the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (iii) be entitled to
observe and review the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
audit, including KPMG\'s work papers, with full access to KPMG during such
audit, which review shall not constitute any approval of or acquiescence in
the Closing Date Balance Sheet on the part of the Purchaser.   (c) In the
event that the Closing Date Book Value is greater than $41,309,068 (which
amount equals total assets less total liabilities as shown on the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at June 30,
2000, which balance sheet is included in Schedule 2.6 hereto), then the
Purchaser shall pay to the Stockholder an amount equal to the difference. In
the event that the Closing Date Book Value is less than the $41,309,068, then
the Stockholder shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
difference.   (d) In the event that the Purchaser does not disagree with
the Closing Date Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 1.8(e) hereof, then the
payment to be made pursuant to Section 1.8(c) shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds on the forty-fifth business day after
the delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet as provided in Section
1.8(a).   (e) In the event that the Purchaser disagrees with the
Closing Balance Sheet, it shall advise the Stockholder within forty-five
business days after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet as provided in
Section 1.8(a), specifying the nature of such disagreement, the reason
therefor and its calculation of the payment it believes is required by
Section 1.8(c). The Stockholder and the Purchaser shall then select a
mutually acceptable firm of certified independent public accountants of
national reputation (the "Independent Accountants") to resolve the
disagreement and to determine the amount of the payment required by Section
1.8(c) (the "Revised Amount"). The Independent Accountants shall deliver
their determination of the Revised Amount to the Stockholder   -5- 
14 and the Purchaser as soon as practicable and such determination shall be
final and binding upon the Stockholder and the Purchaser. Payment of the

each of the Company and the Stockholder, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

promulgated thereunder, state laws (including those governing

investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and Applicable Laws. None of the Company or any Subsidiary, or any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, has committed any
material breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account and
the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all
material respects. All exchange contracts entered into by Chicago Deferred
Exchange Corporation and Chicago Deferred Exchange Corporation of California
qualify, in whole or in part, as like-kind-exchanges within the meaning of
Section 1031 of the Code.   (h) All federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns (as defined below) with respect to Taxes (as defined below) for any

are as set forth in the most recent Forms ADV thereof. Since January 1, 1995,
there have been no material violations or, to the knowledge of the
Stockholder, allegations of material violations of the codes or policies
referenced in this clause (c).   (d) None of the Company, any Subsidiary,
Veredus or any of their respective affiliates has any express or implied
understanding or arrangement which would reasonably be expected to impose an
unfair burden on any of the Funds for purposes of Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or
would in any way violate Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act.   (e)
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.13 hereto, no exemptive orders have been
obtained, nor are any requests pending therefor, with respect to the
Investment Company under any of the Securities Laws.   (f) The Company has
heretofore made available to the Purchaser copies of (i) the audited
financial statements for each of the Funds for its fiscal year ended in 1999
(the "Fund Annual Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited semi-annual
financial statements for each of the Funds for its semi-annual period, if
any, ended after the date of the Annual Financial Statements for such Fund
and prior to the date hereof (the "Fund Interim Financial Statements" and,
together with the Fund Annual Financial Statements, the "Fund Financial
Statements"). Each Fund Financial Statement fairly presents in all material
respects (subject, in the case of the Fund Interim Financial Statements, to
normal year-end adjustments) the financial position and statement of net
assets of such Fund as of the date thereof and its results of operations for
the period then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (except, in the case of
the Fund Interim Financial Statements, for footnote presentation and except
that such statements are unaudited).   (g) Each current prospectus (which
term as used in this Agreement shall include any related statement of
additional information), as amended or supplemented, relating to each Fund
has heretofore been made available to the Purchaser. Each such prospectus, as
amended or supplemented, is in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the
Investment Company Act, and, where applicable, the rules of the NASD, except
for such non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Investment Company has timely filed on behalf of each of the
Funds all prospectuses, financial statements, other forms, reports, sales
literature, and advertising, and any other documents required to be filed
with applicable regulatory authorities (the "Reports"), except where the
failure to file, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would  
-16-  25 not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Reports have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Applicable Laws, except for such non-compliance which, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (h) A copy of each distribution plan adopted by
the Board of Trustees of the Investment Company on behalf of the Funds (other
than the Alleghany/Chicago Trust Money Market Fund) under Rule 12b-1 under
the Investment Company Act ("12b-1 Plan") (or form of 12b-1 Plan adopted by
classes of shares offered by a Fund) has heretofore been made available to
the Purchaser, and all payments due since December 31, 1999 and prior to the
most recently ended payment period under each distribution plan or principal
underwriting agreement to which the Investment Company is a party on behalf
of any Fund have been made in compliance with the related 12b-1 Plan.   (i)
Each of the proxy solicitation materials to be distributed to the
shareholders of each Fund in connection with the Company Approvals and the
Assignment Requirements will contain all information necessary in order
to make the disclosure of information therein satisfy the requirements of
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Section 20 of the Investment Company Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder and such materials (except to the
extent supplied by or related to the Purchaser or Newco or their affiliates)
will be complete in all material respects and will not contain (at the time
such materials are distributed, filed or provided to, or at the time of the
relevant vote of, the shareholders of each Fund in connection with the
Company Approvals and the Assignment Requirements) any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.   (j) The Investment Company on behalf of
each Fund has elected to qualify, and for all taxable years that a Subsidiary
served as investment adviser and with respect to which the applicable statute
of limitations (including any extensions) has not expired ("open taxable
years"), each Fund has continuously qualified, to be treated as a "regulated
investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code and has continuously been
eligible to compute, and has for each such taxable year computed, its federal
income tax under Section 852 of the Code. There is no circumstance that would
cause any Fund to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company under the
provisions of Part I of Subchapter M of the Code (it being understood that
this representation will not be deemed to be violated to the extent the
distribution requirement of Section 852 of the Code can be met by virtue of
the election set forth in Section 855(a) of the Code). At the Closing Date,
all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns with respect to Taxes for
any open taxable years and during which a Subsidiary has served as investment
adviser that were or are required to be filed on or before such date (after
taking into account any extensions of time to file) by or on behalf of a Fund
("Fund Tax Returns") were or shall have been timely filed and were or shall
be complete and correct in all material respects, and all federal and other
Taxes, including interest, penalties, and additions to tax, shown or required
to be shown as due on such returns or otherwise due and payable, shall have
been paid or completely and adequately provided for, except where such
failure to file Fund Tax Returns or pay such Taxes would not have a Company
Material Adverse   -17-  26 Effect. No such Fund Tax Return or other
filing is currently under audit, no assessment has been asserted with respect
to such Fund Tax Returns or other filings, and no requests for waivers of the
time to make any such assessment are pending. None of the Funds is delinquent
in the payment of any material Tax, assessment, or governmental charge.  
Section 2.14 Leases. Schedule 2.14 hereto sets forth a true and complete list
of the leases for the office space occupied by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, complete copies of which heretofore have been made available to
the Purchaser (the "Leases"). Each of the Leases is in full force and effect
and there are no existing defaults on the part of the lessee thereunder nor
does there exist any event or condition on the part of the lessee which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or grounds for
termination or reentry thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries occupies, owns or leases any other real property.   Section
2.15 Intellectual Property.   (a) Schedule 2.15 hereto is a true and
complete list of all (i) registered trademarks and service marks, registered
domain names, registered copyrights and issued patents owned by the Company
or any Subsidiary, (ii) applications for registration or grant of any of the
foregoing, (iii) material unregistered trademarks, service marks, trade
names, logos and assumed names owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, and
(iv) licenses for any of the foregoing, in each case that are used in or
necessary to the conduct of the businesses of the Company or any Subsidiary
as currently conducted. The foregoing items, together with all other
trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, assumed names, patents,
copyrights, trade secrets and confidential business information, computer
software (including custom developed software), licenses, formulae, customer
lists or other databases, designs and inventions (whether patentable or
unpatentable) that are used in or necessary to conduct the businesses of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted constitute the
"Intellectual Property."   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.15, the
Company and each of the Subsidiaries has ownership of, or such other rights
by license, lease or other agreement in and to, the Intellectual Property
necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted. All such
rights owned by the Company or any Subsidiary are valid, subsisting and in
full force and effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.15, neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or
violated any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent, trade secret right or
other proprietary right of any third party except to the extent any such
infringement, misappropriation or violation, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such
infringement, misappropriation or violation. Except as set forth in Schedule
2.15, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, no third party has infringed,
misappropriated or violated any Intellectual Property and no Litigation has
been brought, or is pending, or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, is
threatened, that challenges the legality, enforceability of, or the
Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s right to use, or ownership of,
any Intellectual Property.   -18-  27  Section 2.16 Material Contracts.
Schedule 2.16 sets forth a list of all of the following agreements and
arrangements, whether or not in writing, to which the Company, Veredus or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their assets or properties
is bound and with respect to which the Company, Veredus or any Subsidiary has
any current or future liability or obligation ("Material Contracts"): (a) any
partnership, joint venture or similar agreement and related documentation;
(b) any agreement whereby the Company, Veredus or any Subsidiary acquired or
disposed of an interest constituting in excess of 10% of the ordinary voting
power in or profit interests of another entity; (c) any agreement
establishing or evidencing a right to participate in the profits of any
entity; (d) any agreement that creates any material Encumbrance on the assets
or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary; (e) any guarantee or
agreement to indemnify; or (f) any other agreement or other arrangement which
is material to the business or operations of the Company, Veredus or any of
the Subsidiaries. The Material Contracts are in full force and effect and are
enforceable against the Company, Veredus or the applicable Subsidiary, as the
case may be, in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors\' rights
generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). None of
the Company, Veredus or any of the Subsidiaries is in default under any such
Material Contract or has received written notice of cancellation of
or default under or intent to cancel or declare a default under any
Material Contract. To the knowledge of the Stockholder, no other party to any
Material Contract with the Company or any Subsidiary is in default
thereunder, and there exists no event or condition which (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) would result in a breach or default on the
part of the Company, Veredus or the applicable Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of the Stockholder, any other party under any Material
Contract.   Section 2.17 Benefit Plans.   (a) Except as contemplated in
Exhibits 1.7 and 7.10, Schedule 2.17(a) hereto sets forth a correct and
complete list of (i) all the material employee benefit plans, agreements,
commitments, practices or arrangements of any type providing any compensation
or employee benefits (including, but not limited to, plans described in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) currently maintained by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries may have any
Liability (as hereinafter defined) (contingent or otherwise) (the "Benefit
Plans"), (ii) any collective bargaining agreements covering employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary and (iii) any other agreement or arrangement
relating to compensation or employee benefits to which the Stockholder or any
of its affiliates (other than the Company or any of the Subsidiaries) and any
member of senior management of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries are
parties.   (b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has
made available to the Purchaser true and complete copies of: (i) any written
plan texts and agreements; (ii) the summary plan description currently in
effect and all material modifications thereto, if any; (iii) the most recent
annual return in the federal Form 5500 series, if applicable; (iv) the most
recent annual and periodic accounting of plan assets, if   -19- 
28 applicable; (v) the most recent determination letter, if any, received

valuation, if applicable.   (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.17(c)
hereto, with respect to each Benefit Plan: (i) if intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code, such plan so qualifies, and its trust, if
applicable, is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code; (ii)
such Benefit Plan has been administered and enforced in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all Applicable Laws; (iii) no breach of
fiduciary duty or prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 4975
of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to which the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries or such Benefit Plan may be liable or
otherwise damaged; (iv) no litigation or claim (other than routine claims for
benefits or overpayments of benefits), and no governmental administrative
proceeding, audit or investigation, is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Stockholder, threatened; (v) no "reportable event" (within the meaning of
Section 4043(b) of ERISA) has occurred with respect to which the Company, any
of the Subsidiaries or such Benefit Plan may be liable or otherwise damaged;
(vi) all contributions, premiums, and other payment obligations and all
liabilities for accrued but unfunded obligations for benefits (using
actuarial assumptions which are reasonable, both individually and in the
aggregate) have been accrued on the Financial Statements in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and all contributions required
to be made to such Benefit Plan by the terms of such plan or under Applicable
Laws have been made on a timely basis; (vii) the Company or each of the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has expressly reserved in itself the right
to amend, modify or terminate such Benefit Plan, or any portion of
it, without liability to itself; (viii) no such Benefit Plan requires the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries to continue to employ any employee,
director or consultant; and (ix) with respect to each such Benefit Plan
subject to either Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, no such
Benefit Plan has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not
waived.   (d) No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning
of Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or, except as set forth on
Schedule 2.17(d), a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code). Neither the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries has a current or potential liability or obligation,
whether direct or indirect, with respect to any multiemployer plan or
multiple employer plan for which it is not indemnified.   (e) In the case
of each Benefit Plan which provides welfare benefits of the type described in
Section 3(1) of ERISA: (i) the reserves therefor on the Annual Financial
Statements are adequate to discharge when due the accrued, unfunded
liabilities for medical or death benefits with respect to current or former
employees, directors or consultants of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
beyond their termination of employment (in addition to coverage mandated by
Sections 601-608 of ERISA and 4980B(f) of the Code); and (ii) each such plan
which provides medical or death benefits with respect to current or former
employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has been administered in
all material respects in compliance with Sections 601-608 of ERISA
and 4980B(f) of the Code.   -20-  29  (f) Except as set forth on Schedule
2.17(f), neither the entering into of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in
connection with any other event) will entitle any individual to severance pay
or accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of
compensation or employee benefits due to any individual.   (g) Schedule
2.17(g) sets forth the amount of the payments that could be made after the
Effective Time to any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code) employed by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries directly or indirectly by the Purchaser, the Company, the
Subsidiaries or any person whose relationship to any of the foregoing is such
as to require attribution of stock ownership between the parties
under Section 318(a) of the Code without any part of such payment being
treated as an "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section
280G(b) of the Code). Within five business days after the date hereof,
Schedule 2.17(g) shall be amended to include the information for Messrs.
Stuart Bilton and Skip Newman.   (h) To the knowledge of the Stockholder, no
employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or Veredus identified on

ERISA applies.   Section 2.18 Interests of Officers and Directors. Except

Plans, no present officer or director of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries nor any immediate family member thereof (a) has any agreement,
loan or other obligation outstanding with, to or from the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries may be

of the Purchaser and Newco is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the

Purchaser or Newco that are material to the ability of the Purchaser or Newco

the environment, health and employee safety, in each case applicable to the

with respect to each of clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 3.3, where the
effect of such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss or
acceleration, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially impair
the ability of the Purchaser or Newco to perform their obligations
hereunder.   Section 3.4 Litigation. There are no actions,
suits, proceedings, claims, investigations or examinations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser or Newco or

from the SEC with respect to such disqualification. The Company and the
Stockholder have been provided with a copy of any exemptive order issued by
the SEC in respect of such disqualification. There is no proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened that
would reasonably be expected to become the basis for any such
disqualification. None of the Purchaser, Newco or any "affiliated person" (as
defined under the Investment Company Act) thereof has been convicted of any
crime or has been subject to disqualification as an investment adviser or
subject to disqualification to serve    -24-  33 in any other capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment company under
Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act, unless in each case the
Purchaser, Newco or other "affiliated person," as applicable, has received
exemptive relief from the SEC with respect to such disqualification. The
Company and the Stockholder have been provided with a copy of any exemptive
order issued by the SEC in respect of such disqualification. There is no

have, funds and financing arrangements available to it sufficient to deliver
the Merger Consideration and to fulfill its obligations hereunder.   Section
3.9 Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act. None of the Purchaser, Newco
or any of their affiliates has any express or implied understanding or
arrangement which would reasonably be expected to impose an unfair burden on
any of the Funds for purposes of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or would in any way
violate Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act.   ARTICLE IV

forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and
any and all actions, suits and proceedings incident to the foregoing.   (b)
The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder (and each
member of the affiliated group of which the Stockholder is the common parent,
as such terms are defined in Section 1504 of the Code) against any additional
Tax imposed upon the Stockholder (or any member of its affiliated group) if
any payment made by the Stockholder, the Company or the Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing Date to any "disqualified person" (within the meaning of Section
280G(c) of the Code) employed    -36-  45 by the Company or the
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date is treated as an "excess parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code) by reason of any payment
(including by reason of any transfer of property) to such person on or after
the Closing Date made directly or indirectly by the Purchaser, the Company,
the Subsidiaries or any person whose relationship to any of the foregoing is
such as to require attribution of stock ownership between the parties under
Section 318(a) of the Code; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not
be obligated to indemnify the Stockholder (or any member of its affiliated
group) pursuant to the foregoing, if the information on Schedule 2.17(g) with
respect to the amount of the payments that could be made to such disqualified
person without causing any part of such payment to be treated as an "excess
parachute payment" is inaccurate.   (c) The Purchaser agrees to indemnify
the Stockholder and hold it harmless at all times after the date of this
Agreement from and against and in respect of any and all Liabilities arising
out of or due to the breach of Section 7.8 hereof.   (d) The Stockholder
agrees that indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, subject to all
limitations on such indemnification set forth in this Agreement, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy and means of recovery by the Stockholder against
the Purchaser and Newco with respect to any claim or action seeking damages
or any other form of monetary relief brought by the Stockholder, other than
with respect to fraud or willful misconduct.   Section 8.4 Certain
Indemnification Covenants.   (a) Subject to Section 8.4(c) hereof, the
obligations of the Stockholder to indemnify the Purchaser under Section
8.2(a) hereof shall be limited to $206,250,000, and the Stockholder shall
have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser under Section 8.2(a) hereof
until such time as the aggregate amount of the Liabilities claimed by the
Purchaser exceeds Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000), and then only in
an amount in excess of such Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000).  
(b) Subject to Section 8.4(c) hereof, the obligations of the Purchaser to
indemnify the Stockholder under Section 8.3(a) hereof shall be limited to
$206,250,000, and the Purchaser shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Stockholder under Section 8.3(a) hereof until such time as the
aggregate amount of Liabilities claimed by the Stockholder exceeds Twenty-
Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000), and then only in an amount in excess of
such Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000).   (c) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Sections 8.4(a) and 8.4(b) hereof, there shall be
no limits (including any $25,000,000 deductible or $206,250,000 cap) on the
obligations of the parties hereto to indemnify any other party hereto
pursuant to Sections 8.2(b), 8.3(b), 8.3(c) and Article IX hereof, pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) with respect to breaches of Sections 2.2, 2.11 and 2.17(g)
and the third sentence of Section 2.3, and breaches of any covenants
contained in this Agreement, and therefore obligations to indemnify in
respect of such provisions shall be from the first dollar to the last dollar
of such Liability or Tax, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything in
this    -37-  46 Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of the
provisions set forth in this Article VIII, all Company Material Adverse
Effect, materiality and correlative qualifications included in any of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
disregarded (including for purposes of determining whether a breach has
occurred and for purposes of determining the amount of Liability associated
with a breach).   Section 8.5 Procedure.   (a) The Purchaser on the one
hand, and the Company and the Stockholder, on the other hand, each agree to
promptly notify each other if any of them becomes aware of any Liabilities
with respect to which indemnity may be asserted under this Article VIII
(hereinafter referred to as a "claim"), provided that failure to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve such party from liability except to the
extent such party is materially prejudiced thereby.   (b) The party
entitled to indemnity (the "Indemnitee") shall permit the party responsible
for such indemnity (the "Indemnitor") to assume, by giving written notice to
the Indemnitee within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of such claim,
the defense of, so long as it agreed to irrevocably provide indemnification
with respect to, any such claim or any Litigation resulting from such claim
at its own cost. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any such claim or
Litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnitee may participate, at its
expense, in the defense of such claim or Litigation provided that the
Indemnitor shall direct and control the defense of such claim or Litigation;
provided that, if the Indemnitor proposes that the same counsel represent
both the Indemnitee (or subsidiaries thereof) and the Indemnitor
(or subsidiaries thereof) and representation of both parties by the same
counsel is subject to a conflict of interest in the written opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, then the Indemnitee shall
have the right to retain its own counsel at the cost and expense of the
Indemnitor. The Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor all records
and other materials in the possession or under the control of the Indemnitee
and required by the Indemnitor in defending any such claim, and shall in all
respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense. Except with the written
consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, the Indemnitor shall not, in the defense of such claim or any
Litigation resulting therefrom, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement of such claim or Litigation which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or
Litigation.   (c) If the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any
such claim or Litigation resulting therefrom, by giving written notice to
the Indemnitee within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of such claim,
the Indemnitee may defend against such claim or Litigation in such manner as
it may deem appropriate. The Indemnitee shall not consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement of such claim or Litigation without the
written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Indemnitor shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee
from time to time for any and all amounts paid for or incurred by the
Indemnitee and for which the Indemnitor is obligated pursuant to this Article
VIII, upon submission by the Indemnitee    -38-  47 of a statement
reflecting the basis upon which such indemnification is sought and the
computation of such amounts.   (d) If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of
the claim in accordance with Section 8.5(b) and the Indemnitor fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such claim within 30 calendar
days after receiving written notice from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may,
at its option, elect to settle or assume its own defense, assisted by counsel
of its own choosing, and the Indemnitor will be liable for all Liabilities
incurred in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Indemnitee
shall not, in the defense of such claim or any Litigation resulting
therefrom, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of
such claim or Litigation except with the written consent of Indemnitor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   ARTICLE IX   TAX
MATTERS   Section 9.1 Tax Returns.   (a) The Stockholder shall cause the
Company and each Subsidiary that is a corporation for federal income tax
purposes to join, for all taxable periods of the Company and such Subsidiary
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in any Consolidated Income Tax Return
(as defined below).   (b) The Stockholder shall, or shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of or
including the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed
(with extensions) on or before the Closing Date and shall timely pay all
Taxes due as shown on such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns will be prepared
and filed by the Stockholder, the Company or its Subsidiaries in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the Stockholder, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.   (c) For each taxable year of the Stockholder
for which the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for all or any part
of such taxable year on any Consolidated Income Tax Return of the Stockholder
which is due (with all extensions) to be filed after the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare, or shall cause the Subsidiaries to prepare, in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and deliver to the Stockholder no later than June 15th, all
relevant Tax schedules, forms and information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, complete in all material respects, to permit their inclusion in
such Consolidated Income Tax Returns of the Stockholder for each such taxable
year. The Stockholder shall timely file all Consolidated Income Tax Returns
and shall timely pay all Taxes due as shown on such Consolidated Income Tax
Returns.   (d) The Stockholder and the Purchaser and the Company agree that
for all Income Tax purposes, the taxable period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries which    -39-  48 began on January 1st of the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be terminated as of the close of
business on the Closing Date in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1) (other than transactions properly allocable thereunder to the
portion of the day after the Closing shall occur) and items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit shall be apportioned based upon a closing of the
books for Tax purposes in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b). No election shall be made under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation of a year\'s items), and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) will be applied to ratably
allocate the items (other than extraordinary items, including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, compensation items) for the month
which includes the Closing Date. The Stockholder and the Purchaser and the
Company further agree to file all Tax Returns (including, without limitation,
all state income Tax Returns), handle the contest of any audit and otherwise
act for all Tax purposes consistent with the provisions of this Section
9.1(d).   (e) In the case of any Tax Return for any (i) taxable period of
the Company or any Subsidiary beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), or (ii) any taxable period of the Company
or any Subsidiary ending on or before the Closing Date that is required to be
filed after the Closing Date (other than Tax Returns described in Section
9.1(b) and 9.1(c)) (a "Pre-Closing Tax Return"), the Company shall provide
the Stockholder with copies of the completed Tax Return for such taxable
period, together with such related work papers and other documents as the
Stockholder shall reasonably request, no later than 30 days before the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return. The Stockholder and its authorized
representatives shall have the right to review the Tax Returns received from
the Company pursuant to this Section 9.1(e), and the Company shall make such
changes to any Pre-Closing Return as is requested by Stockholder for which
there is a reasonable basis in fact and law to the extent consistent with the
prior practice of the Stockholder, the Company or the Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and subject to Section 9.5(c). No fewer than 5 days before the
due date of the filing (such date to mean the last date that the filing can
be made without incurring interest or penalties) of the Tax Return (i) in
respect of a Straddle Period, the Stockholder shall pay to the Company an
amount equal to the portion of any Tax relating to a Straddle Period that is
attributable to the Stockholder pursuant to Section 9.3(b) hereof in excess
of the accruals for such Taxes reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
and (ii) in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Return, the Stockholder shall pay
to the Company an amount equal to all Taxes due as shown on such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns in excess of the accruals for such Taxes reflected in the
Closing Date Balance Sheet. If as a result of the review of any Tax Returns
relating to a Straddle Period received from the Company the Stockholder
disputes the treatment of any items on the Tax Returns prepared by the
Company, the Stockholder and the Purchaser agree to consult with each other
and attempt to resolve in good faith any such dispute. If the parties are
unable to resolve any dispute within 60 business days after the receipt of
any such Tax Returns, the parties shall submit such dispute to a mutually
acceptable national accounting firm (which shall not be the accountants who
regularly audit the financial statements of the Stockholder or the
Purchaser), whose decision shall be conclusive and binding on the parties.
The Stockholder and the Company shall each pay one-half of the fees and
expenses of such accounting firm. If such disputes have not been resolved
prior    -40-  49 to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
relating to a Straddle Period, the Tax Return in question, to the extent any
issues thereon remain unresolved, shall be filed (and the Stockholder shall
make payments pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)) in accordance with the
positions taken by the Purchaser, provided that the fact that such Tax Return
will have been filed in accordance with the Purchaser\'s position shall not
be taken into account for purposes of any dispute resolution under this
Section 9.1(e). If a determination is made through the dispute resolution
process after a Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period is filed that the
Purchaser\'s position was inappropriate, the Purchaser shall promptly file an
amended Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) reflecting the final decision of the accounting firm and an
adjusting payment will be made by the Stockholder to the Purchaser or the
Purchaser to the Stockholder, as the case may be, to reflect any difference
between the Tax due with respect to the amended Tax Return relating to a
Straddle Period and the Tax due with respect to the Tax Return as originally
filed. In addition, if at the time of any payment under this Section 9.1(e)
the Closing Date Balance Sheet has not been finalized, then the
payments under this Section 9.1(e) shall be made on the basis of the then
best available estimates of the Stockholder of the accruals for Taxes that
will be reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet as certified by the
Stockholder in writing (together with its calculation of such estimate and a
description in reasonable detail of the manner in which such estimate was
calculated), and within five (5) business days after the Closing Date Balance
Sheet is finalized an adjusting payment will be made by the Stockholder to
the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Stockholder, as the case may be, to
reflect any difference between the estimate and the actual accruals.   (f)
For purposes of this agreement, "Consolidated Income Tax Return" means any
consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated Income Tax Return of the
Stockholder which the Company is required or eligible to join; "Income Tax"
or "Income Taxes" means all Taxes (x) based upon, measured by, or calculated
with respect to, net income or net receipts, proceeds or profits, or (y)
based upon, measured by, or calculated with respect to multiple
bases (including, but not limited to, corporate franchise and occupation
Taxes) if such Tax may be based upon, measured by, or calculated with respect
to one or more bases described in clause (x) above and shall include, without
limitation, the Illinois personal property replacement tax under 35 ILCS
5/201; and "Income Tax Return" means any Tax Return relating to Income
Taxes.   Section 9.2 Post-Closing Tax Matters.   (a) To the extent
relevant for a taxable period for which the requesting party is charged with
payment responsibility for Taxes under this Agreement, each of the
Stockholder and the Purchaser will provide the other (and the other\'s
attorneys, accountants and agents) with, and the Company, after the Closing
Date, shall cause the Subsidiaries to provide the Stockholder (and
the Stockholder\'s attorneys, accountants and agents) with, the right, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to have access to, and to copy
and use, any records or information and personnel which may be relevant for
the preparation of any Tax Returns, the determination of amounts due under
Section 9.3 hereof, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority,
the filing of any claim for a refund of Tax or for the allowance of any Tax
credit, or any judicial or    -41-  50 administrative proceedings
relating to liability for Taxes. The party requesting assistance hereunder
shall reimburse the other party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing such assistance. Any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 9.2(a) shall be held in strict confidence and shall be used
solely in connection with the reason for which it was requested.   (b) The
Stockholder shall cause any tax sharing agreement or similar arrangement with
respect to Taxes involving the Company or its Subsidiaries to be terminated
effective as of the Closing Date. To the extent any such agreement or
arrangement obligates the Company or its Subsidiaries to make any payments
with respect to Taxes after the Closing Date, none of the Company, the
Subsidiaries or the Stockholder shall have any obligation under any such
agreement or arrangement for any past, present or future period. All
powers of attorney granted by the Company and any Subsidiary with respect to
Taxes shall be revoked as of the Closing Date.   (c) Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement: (i) any refund of Taxes with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is received with respect to any
taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on or before the
Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") in excess of the accruals for
such refunds reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the portion of
any Straddle Period for which the Stockholder is responsible pursuant to
Section 9.3(b) hereof (such portion being referred to herein as the
"Stockholder\'s Straddle Period") in excess of the accruals for such refunds
reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be for the account of the
Stockholder, and to the extent that the Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary receives any such refund after the Closing Date with respect
to any such Pre-Closing Tax Period or the Stockholder\'s Straddle Period, the
amount of such excess (net of any Taxes imposed with respect to the receipt
or accrual of such excess and any expenses incurred in connection with
obtaining the refund) shall be promptly paid to the Stockholder.   (d)
Notwithstanding Section 6.1(c), the Company may pay or cause the Subsidiaries
to pay to the Stockholder on the day preceding the Closing Date (i) the
amount of any reserve or provision for Income Taxes (not including any
deferred Income Taxes) on the June 30, 2000 balance sheet and (ii) the amount
of any reserve or provision for Income Taxes (not including any deferred
Income Taxes) on its books and records in respect of income of the Company or
the Subsidiaries derived in the ordinary course of business for the period
from July 1, 2000 through the day preceding the Closing Date, in each case in
excess of the amount, if any, paid out of such reserves since June 30, 2000
to any Tax Authority or to the Stockholder.   Section 9.3 Stockholder
Indemnity for Taxes.   (a) The Stockholder shall pay and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries from: (i) all
Liability in respect of Income Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Stockholder\'s Straddle Period
(including, without limitation, all Liability for any Tax arising from the
Section 338 Elections); (ii) all Liability in respect of any Tax (other than
Liability in respect of any Income Taxes) to the extent that the amount of
the Liability    -42-  51 exceeds the amount of accrual (if any) for such
Taxes reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the Stockholder\'s Straddle
Period; (iii) any additional Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries as a
result of the disallowance of any deduction for any excess parachute payment
made to any person identified on Schedule 2.17(g) hereof and attributable to
any inaccuracy in the amount of the payment which could be made to such
person as set forth on Schedule 2.17(g) hereof; (iv) all liability resulting
by reason of the several liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state,
local or foreign law or regulation or by reason of the Company and
its Subsidiaries having been a member of any consolidated, combined or
unitary group on or prior to the Closing Date; and (v) all liability of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Taxes of any other person or
entity pursuant to any agreement or contract, whether written or unwritten,
entered into on or before the Closing Date, or as a transferor or successor,
by contract or otherwise.   (b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the
Stockholder shall be solely responsible for all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries attributable to the portion of the period ending on, and which
includes, the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
all Taxes attributable to the portion of the period which begins after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of any Tax that is
attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is not an Income Tax or
any Tax based on gross income, sales or gross receipts (including real
property taxes), the total amount of such Tax for the period in question
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date, and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of an Income Tax and any Tax that is based on any of gross income, sales
or gross receipts, the Tax that would be due with respect to the portion of
the Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date, if such portion
of the Straddle Period were a separate taxable Pre-Closing Tax Period, except
that exemptions, allowances, deductions or credits that are calculated on an
annual basis (such as the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances)
shall be apportioned on a per diem basis.   Section 9.4 Matters Involving
Tax Claims. If a claim is made or threatened by any Taxing Authority that, if
successful, may result in an indemnity payment under Section 9.3(a) or
Section 9.5(b) hereof (a "Tax Claim"), the Purchaser shall notify the
Stockholder stating the nature and basis of such claim, and the amount
thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice shall not relieve
the Stockholder from any liability that it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, except to the extent that the Stockholder is
materially prejudiced in the defense of such claim thereby. The
Stockholder will have the right, at its option, upon timely notice to the
Purchaser, to assume at its own expense control of any audit or other defense
of any Tax Claim with its own counsel. The Stockholder\'s right to control a
Tax Claim will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in dispute
would be paid by the Stockholder or for which the Stockholder would be liable
pursuant to Section 9.3(a) or Section 9.5(b) hereof, which determination
shall be made by the Stockholder in its sole discretion. Costs of such Tax
Claims are to be borne by the Stockholder unless the Tax Claim relates   
-43-  52 to a Straddle Period, in which event such costs shall be fairly
apportioned. The Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries at their own
expense shall cooperate with the Stockholder in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon the Stockholder\'s
request, providing of records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Claim and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Stockholder shall not have
the right to control any Tax Claim unless it first acknowledges in writing
its obligation to fully indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes at issue in the
proceeding, (ii) no settlement or disposition of any Tax Claim shall be made
without the Purchaser\'s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) if the same could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Purchaser\'s, the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s Liability for Taxes in a
taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date, and (iii) the
Purchaser and the Stockholder shall jointly control all proceedings taken in
connection with any claims for Taxes relating solely to a Straddle Period of
any of the Company or the Subsidiaries, and each party shall bear its own
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the contest and all joint costs and
expenses of the contest shall be borne in the same ratio as the applicable
proposed Tax would be allocated.   Section 9.5 Section 338 Election.   (a)
The Stockholder shall join with the Purchaser in making a timely and
irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the
Company and each Subsidiary which is a corporation and, if permissible, shall
make all similar elections requested by the Purchaser under any applicable
state or local Tax laws with respect to the Company and each Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Section 338 Elections"). The Stockholder shall report the
acquisition of the Company by the Purchaser in a manner consistent with the
making of the Section 338 Elections and shall take no position
contrary thereto in any Tax Return or audit or any proceeding before any Tax
authority without the written consent of the Purchaser.   (b) The
Stockholder shall be responsible for and indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Company) from and against any and
all Liabilities arising from any Section 338 Elections being ineffective,
invalid, improperly or untimely filed to the extent attributable to (i.e.,
that would not have been incurred but for) (i) the Stockholder\'s failure to
timely or validly execute any Section 338 Forms (as defined below) or
file any Section 338 Forms with any applicable Tax Return, (ii) any
information provided by the Stockholder in connection with the Section 338
Forms being inaccurate, untimely, or incomplete or (iii) the inaccuracy of
the representation set forth in Section 2.11(e) of this Agreement.   (c)
The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for preparing drafts of all forms,
attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338 Elections,
including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023 or applicable successor form,
and any similar forms or applicable successor forms under applicable state or
local income tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms"). The Stockholder shall
cooperate in good faith with the Purchaser in Purchaser\'s preparation of the
Section 338 Forms and shall promptly    -44-  53 provide to the Purchaser
all relevant information reasonably requested by the Purchaser and necessary
to complete the Section 338 Forms.   (d) At least 45 days prior to the
latest date for the filing of any Section 338 Form by the Stockholder, the
Purchaser shall furnish the Stockholder with a copy of each such form for its
review and comment, and if the Purchaser\'s proposed determination of the
ADSP (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338) and
allocation of the ADSP to the assets of the Company and other relevant items
(the "Proposed Allocation") is set forth on such Section 338 Election Form
and the Proposed Allocation has not previously been provided to Stockholder,
together with the Proposed Allocation, along with a copy of the appraisals,
if any, on which such Proposed Allocation is based. The Purchaser and the
Stockholder each agree to consult in good faith with regard to the proposed
determination of the ADSP and the Proposed Allocation, provided that the
Stockholder shall accept Purchaser\'s final determination of the ADSP and the
Proposed Allocation (which the Purchaser shall provide to the Stockholder at
least fifteen days prior to the due date for filing of the Section 338
Forms), to the extent that they are reasonable and consistent with applicable
Tax law (which, when accepted, shall become the "Final Allocation"). If
requested by Purchaser, Stockholder shall attempt in good faith to
execute the Section 338 Forms at or prior to the Closing, and, if any Section
338 Forms are not executed at the Closing, the Stockholder shall execute and
deliver to Purchaser such Section 338 Forms within ten (10) days after such
forms are received by the Stockholder. The Stockholder and Purchaser will
reflect such Final Allocation in all applicable Tax Returns filed by any of
them, including but not limited to the Section 338 Forms. The Stockholder and
the Purchaser, and the Company shall not take a position before any Tax
authority or otherwise (including in any Tax Return) inconsistent with the
Purchaser\'s determination of the ADSP and the Final Allocation unless and to
the extent required to do so pursuant to a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or local law).   (e) The
Purchaser shall bear all of the costs and expenses of preparing the Section
338 Elections and the Proposed and Final Allocations other than costs and
expenses incurred by the Stockholder in connection with the review of the
Proposed Allocation or any Section 338 Election or the execution of any
Section 338 Election.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the deemed
purchaser in the Section 338 Election hereby expressly assumes all
liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken into account in
determining the ADSP (it being understood that this provision shall have no
effect on any party\'s obligation under this Agreement to be responsible for
or indemnify for any Liability).   ARTICLE X   MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS   Section 10.1 Termination. At any time prior to the
Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated:    -45-  54  (a) by
mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Stockholder;   (b) by
either the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Stockholder, on the other
hand, upon written notice to the other if, without fault of the terminating
party, the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 18, 2001;
provided, however, that, if the only reason that the Closing shall not have
occurred by such date is the fact that any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 5.4 or 5.5 have not been satisfied or waived, then
neither the Purchaser nor the Stockholder may terminate this Agreement unless
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 18,
2001; notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;
or   (c) by the Stockholder if an event occurs that makes it impossible to
satisfy any condition set forth in Article V of this Agreement or by the
Purchaser if an event occurs that makes it impossible to satisfy
any condition set forth in Article IV of this Agreement; provided, however,

impossibility;  In the event of any termination pursuant to this Section
10.1, the parties hereto shall be released from all liabilities and
obligations arising under this Agreement with respect to matters contemplated

press release or otherwise make any public announcement with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent
of the other parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or

by applicable law, in which case such party shall consult, to the extent
practicable, with the other parties prior to issuing such press release or
making such public announcement.   Section 10.5 Notice. From the date hereof
until the Closing, each party shall give prompt written notice to the other
parties of (a) the occurrence, or failure to    -47-  56 occur, of any
event which occurrence or failure would cause or be likely to cause any
representation or warranty of the party giving notice contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date hereof to the Closing, or (b) any failure of the party giving notice
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by such party hereunder; provided, however, that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 10.5 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the parties
receiving notice, or modify in any way any disclosure made in this Agreement
or the Schedules hereto as of the date hereof.   Section 10.6 Remedies.
Without intending to limit the remedies available to any party hereto, each
party (i) acknowledges that breach of this Agreement will result in
irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and (ii)
agrees that any party seeking to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to
injunctive relief, including specific performance, or other equitable
remedies upon any such breach.   Section 10.7 Entire Agreement; Amendment.
This Agreement, together with the exhibits and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the letters from the Stockholder to the Purchaser dated
the date hereof, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to
the subject matter hereof except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall continue in full force and effect until Closing. No party hereto has
relied upon any oral or written statement, representation, warranty,
covenant, condition, understanding or agreement made by any other party or
any representative, agent or employee thereof, except for those expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in the schedules, certificates or exhibits
delivered pursuant hereto. Disclosure on any one of the schedules hereto
constitutes disclosure on each other schedule as applicable (to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure for each such other schedule
is reasonably evident from the text thereof). This Agreement may be
amended, modified, superseded or supplemented only by an instrument in
writing executed and delivered by the parties hereto.   Section 10.8
Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto; provided,
however, that no assignment of any rights or delegation of any obligations
provided for herein shall be made by any party hereto without the express
prior written consent of each other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may assign all or some of its rights under this Agreement to any of
its affiliates or its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, provided
that no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as provided in
Exhibits 1.7 and 7.10 hereto.    -48-  57  Section 10.9 Governing Law.

of the jurisdiction of organization of the relevant entity.   Section 10.10
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.   Section 10.11
Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.   Section 10.12 Severability. In the event
that any provision hereof is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.    -49-  58  IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
