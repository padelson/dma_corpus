Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute, the Buyer and Seller shall
submit such dispute to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute shall

by Buyer and the Seller (or, if Buyer and the Seller cannot agree on an
accounting firm within fifteen (15) days after such thirty (30) day dispute
resolution period, each of Buyer and the Seller shall promptly select a
nationally recognized accounting firm and such two accounting firms shall
designate a third nationally recognized accounting firm that neither presently
is, nor in the past three years has been, engaged by either Party). The

in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute and in determining the
Closing Date Cash and the Net Working Capital, the Accounting Firm shall (i)
not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater than the

Seller, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, (ii)
make its determination based on an independent review (which will be in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement)
and, at the Accounting Firm's discretion, a one-day conference concerning the
dispute, at which conference each of Buyer and the Seller shall have the right
to present their respective positions with respect to the dispute and have
present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants, (iii) render a
final resolution in writing to Buyer and the Seller (which final resolution
shall be requested by Buyer and the Seller to be delivered not more than
forty-five (45) days following submission of such disputed matters), which
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties with respect to the
Closing Date Cash and the Net Working Capital and (iv) provide a written
report to Buyer and the Seller, if requested by either of them, which sets
forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firm's final
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage by which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each of Buyer and the Seller bears to the total amount actually contested by
such Parties.

  

  

(e) The Preliminary Closing Statement (as revised to reflect the resolution of
any disputed matters in accordance with this Section 2.6) shall be deemed to
be the Final Closing Statement for the purposes of this Section 2.6 upon the

15  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

provide a Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days after the Seller
receives the Preliminary Closing Statement, (ii) the resolution in writing of
all disputes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section
2.6(c) by the Buyer and the Seller and (iii) the resolution of all disputes
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 2.6(d) by the
Accounting Firm.

  

  

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement in accordance with Section 2.6(e):

  

  

(i) If there is a Final Deficit, then the Buyer shall be entitled to claim,
first, from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, an amount equal to such
Final Deficit, and, second (if the Final Deficit exceeds the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount), the balance of the Final Deficit from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund.

  

  

(ii) If there is a Final Surplus, then Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount
equal to such Final Surplus.

  

  

(iii) Promptly after the payment of a Final Deficit or a Final Surplus, as
applicable, Buyer and Seller shall direct the Escrow Agent to disburse the
balance of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (including any income
and interest earned thereon) to Seller in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(g) Each payment required under this Section 2.6 shall include simple interest
on the amount of such payment from the Closing Date up to but excluding the
date on which such payment is made at a two percent (2%) rate per annum and
shall be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
bank account(s) as shall be designated in writing by the recipient(s) at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable payment date.

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary under applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, including obtaining all licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities
and other third parties necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, that in no event shall Buyer, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Seller be required to pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to obtain any license, permit, consent, approval, authorization,
qualification or waiver required under any Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or is bound for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Each Party will promptly after execution of this Agreement (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof) make all
filings or submissions as are required under the HSR Act. Each Party will
promptly furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. Each Party will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of any waiting period
under the HSR Act and will promptly provide the other with copies of all
written communications (and convey the substance of all oral communications)
between it, any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Party will promptly notify the other of the
receipt and content of any material inquiries or requests for additional
information made by any Governmental Entity in connection therewith and will
promptly (i) comply with any such inquiry or request and (ii) provide the
other with a description

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

of the information provided to any Governmental Entity with respect to any
such inquiry or request. In addition, each Party will keep the other apprised
on a prompt basis of the status of any such inquiry or request.

  

  

(c) No Party shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the approval of any Governmental Entity that
is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties
further covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, to
use reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

  

  

(d) Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Entities and
shall undertake promptly any and all action required or necessary to (i)
promptly comply with or modify any requests for additional information
(including, without limitation, any second request) by any Governmental
Entity, including supplying any additional information which reasonably may be
required by the United States Federal Trade Commission and/or the United
States Department of Justice, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any anti-trust, competition or trade regulation law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur
expeditiously; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer
shall not be required to agree to a sale or disposition of any particular
assets, categories of assets or lines of businesses of, or restrictions,
prohibitions or limitations on the businesses or operations of, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of its Affiliates in furtherance of its
obligations under this Section 6.2.

  

  

Section 6.3 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise required by Law
(including any regulation or rule of any stock exchange on which any
securities of a Party are then listed), none of the Parties shall, and each
Party shall cause its Affiliates not to, make or issue any public announcement
or press release to the general public with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. The Parties understand and agree that Pamlico intends
to publicly disclose the existence of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and that
Buyer's consent shall be required with respect to such disclosure (with such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided
that Pamlico shall not publicly disclose the existence of this Agreement other
than concurrently with or following Buyer's public disclosure of the existence
of this Agreement promptly after the date hereof.

  

  

Section 6.4 Supplemental Disclosure. The Seller and the Company may, from time
to time prior to or at the Closing, supplement, amend or create any Schedule
to this Agreement in order to add information or correct previously supplied
information. It is agreed that such Schedules may be amended or created to add
immaterial, as well as material, items thereto. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no such supplemental, amended or
additional Schedule shall (a) be deemed to cure any breach for purposes of
Article VII or (b) affect in any manner whatsoever, or relieve, the Seller or
the Company of liability or

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

diminish any right or remedies of Buyer with respect to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made to Buyer in this Agreement or (ii) any breach
of, or failure to perform, any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, in each case, that may exist without any such supplemental, amended
or additional Schedule.

  

  

Section 6.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Returns. Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all periods that have not yet been
filed and are required to be filed after the Effective Time. Buyer shall
prepare such Tax Returns consistent with past practices of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, unless otherwise required by Law. Buyer shall, subject
to Buyer's right to indemnification from Seller under Article XII, cause any
amounts shown to be due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity no later than the date on which such Taxes are
due. At least five (5) days prior to the due date of the related Tax Return,
Seller shall pay to Buyer Seller's share of Taxes under this Agreement
(calculated without regard to any Transaction Deductions), including those
allocable under Section 6.5(b).

  

  

(b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end at) the
Effective Time (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes (other than
property or ad valorem Taxes) for the portion of such Straddle Period ending
at the Effective Time shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the Effective Time. In the case of any property or ad valorem
Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on day immediately prior to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall provide the Seller with a copy of the income Tax Returns of
the Company for any taxable period ending at or prior to the Effective Time or
any Straddle Period for review and comment not later than forty-five (45) days
prior to its due date (including extensions). The Seller shall review and
comment on such Tax Returns within fifteen (15) days of receipt thereof. If
the Seller does not submit comments within such period, then the Seller will
be deemed to have approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Buyer, and Buyer
will file such Tax Returns promptly. If the Seller delivers comments to Buyer
within such fifteen (15) day period, the Seller and Buyer shall use good faith
efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments. In the event
Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree on any such revisions within fifteen
(15) days after the Seller provides its comments, Buyer and the Seller shall
engage the Accounting Firm to resolve the dispute, the costs of which shall be
borne equally by the Seller on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand. Upon
the final determination of such dispute, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
such Tax Returns promptly but no later than five (5) Business Days after such
final determination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.5(c), Buyer shall be entitled to file, or cause to be filed, the applicable
Tax Return without having incorporated the disagreed upon changes to avoid a
late filing of such Tax Return. In the event the Accounting Firm's resolution
of the dispute necessitates that a Tax

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence be amended, Buyer shall
cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects such resolution.

  

  

(d) Tax Refunds. Buyer shall (without duplication) pay to the Seller any
refunds of Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for pre-Closing Tax
periods, other than any refunds that are attributable to (i) any carryback of
net operating losses, capital losses or other Tax attributes attributable to a
Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) any
Transactions Deductions. Buyer shall make payment of any such refund described
in this Section 6.5(d), net of any associated out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund, to
the Seller within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the refund.

  

  

(e) Amendment of Tax Returns. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to a pre-Closing Tax
period unless required by Law without the prior written consent of the Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

(f) Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date after
the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated hereby,
Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to carry on
business only in the Ordinary Course.

  

  

(g) No Section 338 Election. Buyer shall not cause or permit an election under
Section 338 of the Code to be made with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid when due and fifty percent (50%)
of such Taxes shall be borne by each of Buyer and the Seller. Buyer will, at
the expense of Buyer and the Seller (each bearing fifty percent (50%) of such
expenses), file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Seller will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  

  

(i) Preservation of Records. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Buyer agrees that it shall, and it shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, (i) preserve and keep the records (including all Tax and
accounting records) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a period
of seven (7) years from the Closing, or for any longer periods as may be
required by any Governmental Entity or ongoing litigation, and (ii) unless
such records relate to a pending or threatened dispute between the Parties,
make such records available to the Seller as may be reasonably requested by
the Seller. If Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary wishes to destroy
such records after the time specified above, Buyer shall first give sixty (60)
days' prior written notice to the Seller and the Seller shall have the right
at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to Buyer within
that sixty (60)-day

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

period, to take possession of the records within ninety (90) days after the
date of the Seller's notice to Buyer.

  

  

Section 6.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Buyer agrees that (i) the governing documents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing shall contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries of such
provisions as those provisions that are set forth in the governing documents
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, on the date of this
Agreement, and, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer
agrees to, and to cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, indemnify
and hold harmless all current or former directors, officers, managers,
employees and agents of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the
same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to such governing documents
and (ii) all rights to indemnification as provided in any indemnification
agreements with any current or former directors, officers, managers, employees
and agents of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect as
of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing. The Parties acknowledge that the foregoing
is intended to apply to all of the current or former directors (including such
directors employed or otherwise designated, by the holders of equity in the
Seller's parent entity), officers, managers, employees and agents of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in their capacity as such and not,
to the extent applicable, in their capacity as directors, officers, managers,
employees and agents of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), and Buyer and the Company shall not be
required to indemnify such Persons to the extent the indemnification
obligation (i) relates to, and arises from, a claim by Buyer for
indemnification pursuant to Article X or (ii) is covered by insurance in favor
of such indemnified Person.

  

  

(b) The Seller (or a third party at the direction of the Seller), at the
Seller's sole expense, may cause the Company to purchase "tail" coverage for
(i) DandO insurance for a period of (6) years following the Closing Date, and
(ii) Miscellaneous Professional Liability insurance for a period of (3) years
following the Closing Date, in each case, (i) for events occurring prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) for the benefit of the directors, officers,
managers, employees and agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
with terms and conditions substantially similar to the insurance coverage as
of the date hereof. The aggregate amount necessary to purchase such "tail"
coverage shall be treated as a Transaction Expense or otherwise reflected in
the calculation of Net Working Capital.

  

  

Section 6.7 Access. From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement or the Closing, subject to any applicable Law, the Seller
and the Company will permit Buyer and its representatives, at Buyer's sole
cost and expense, to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, premises, facilities,
information technology systems, employees and representatives and books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (to the extent in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), but only to
the extent that such access does not unreasonably

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

interfere with the personnel, operations or properties of the Seller, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and the Company shall direct its employees,
agents and representatives to cooperate reasonably with Buyer and its
representatives with respect to the foregoing and, during such period, shall
promptly provide access to such information concerning the businesses,
properties and personnel of the Company and any Company Subsidiary as Buyer
and its representatives may reasonably request but only to the extent that
such provision and/or access does not unreasonably interfere with the
personnel, operations or properties of any Seller or the Company provided,
however, that no such access shall be required if it would violate applicable
Law or any Contractual restrictions on the Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
prior to the Closing, any meetings or other communications with any employees,
agents or representatives of the Company or any Company Subsidiary hereunder
shall be arranged and supervised by the Company or its representatives, unless
the Company shall expressly consent with respect to any specific contact.

  

  

Section 6.8 Further Assurances. After the Closing Date, the Seller, the
Company and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts from time to time to
execute and deliver at the reasonable request of any other Party such
additional documents and instruments, and to take, or refrain from taking,
such other actions, as may be reasonably required to give effect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 6.9 Related-Party Transactions With Non-Management Affiliates. On or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
terminate all Contracts with the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Company or any Company Subsidiary), and the Seller hereby agrees and
acknowledges that from and after Closing no further payments are due, or may
become due, under or in respect of any such terminated Contracts to which it
or Pamlico is a party; provided that in no event shall the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pay any fee or otherwise incur any expense or financial
exposure with respect to any such termination.

  

  

Section 6.10 Notice of Payments to Employees. The Seller will promptly inform
Buyer in writing of the amount of any cash payments that it or its Affiliates
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) plan to make to any
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in their capacity
as such before or after the Closing other than any cash payments that are (i)
Change of Control Payments or (ii) solely with respect the ownership of
membership interests in the Seller.

Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Buyer or
the Seller may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Sections 7.1,
7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, if such failure was caused by such Party's
failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time at or
prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) in writing, by mutual consent of Buyer and the Seller;

  

  

(b) by Buyer (provided that Buyer is not then in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and none of the representations and
warranties of Buyer have become untrue, in each case in such a manner as would
result in the conditions in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not being
satisfied) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement made by the Company or the Seller in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue or
inaccurate after the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach,
untruth or inaccuracy (i) would result in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) not
being satisfied (a "Terminating Company Breach"), and shall not have been
cured within ten (10) days after written notice from Buyer of such Terminating
Company Breach is received by the Company and the Seller (such notice to
describe such Terminating Company Breach in reasonable detail) or (ii) which
breach, untruth or inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Outside Date;

  

  

(c) by the Seller (provided that neither the Company nor the Seller is then in
material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and none of the
representations and warranties of the Seller or the Company have become
untrue, in each case in such a manner as would result in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) not being satisfied) if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made by Buyer in this
Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have become untrue or
inaccurate after the date of this Agreement, in each case which breach,
untruth or inaccuracy (i) would result in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not
being satisfied (a "Terminating Buyer Breach") and shall not have been cured
within ten (10) days after written notice from the Seller of such Terminating
Buyer Breach is received by Buyer (such notice to describe such Terminating
Buyer Breach in reasonable detail), or (ii) which breach, untruth or
inaccuracy, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date; or

  

  

(d) by the Seller or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have taken place on or
prior to December 31, 2012 (the "Outside Date"); provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to
(i) the Seller if the failure of the Seller to fulfill any of its obligations
under this Agreement caused the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date or (ii) the Buyer if the failure of the Buyer to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement caused the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to such date; provided further that the Outside Date shall be
automatically extended to June 30, 2013 if the failure of the Closing to occur
on or prior to the Outside Date is due to the failure of any of the conditions

Section 9.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the Party so terminating to the other Parties, and,
subject to this Section 9.2, this Agreement shall terminate, become void and
no effect and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without
further action by any Party. The date of any such termination is referred to
herein as the "Termination Date". If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1:

  

  

(a) each Party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other materials
of another Party or Parties, as applicable, relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof, to
the Party furnishing the same or, upon prior written notice to such Party,
shall destroy all such documents, work papers and other materials and deliver
notice to the Party seeking destruction of such documents that such
destruction has been completed, and all confidential information received by
any Party with respect to the other Parties shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that each Party may
retain copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part, mechanical
or electronic, of such documents, work papers and other materials in
accordance with such Party's record retention policies and procedures or to
the extent necessary to comply with applicable legal or regulatory
requirements; provided, further, however, any documents, work papers or other
materials retained pursuant to the foregoing proviso shall remain subject to
the confidentiality obligations contained in Section 6.9 and the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(b) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant hereto
shall, at the option of the Company, and to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the agency or other Person to which made; and

  

  

(c) there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of the
Company, the Seller, Buyer, any Member or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or representatives, except (i)
liability for fraud, willful misconduct or a willful, material breach by the
Company, the Seller, a Member or Buyer, as the case may be, of one or more of
the provisions of this Agreement, then the breaching Party shall be liable to
the non-breaching Party, and (ii) that the terms and obligations provided for
in this Section 9.2 and Sections 1.1 (Definitions), 6.3 (Public
Announcements), 11.1 (Fees and Expenses), 11.2 (Notices), 11.3 (Severability),
11.7 (Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.) and 11.9 (Governing Law) hereof and in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any such termination.

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until a Closing occurs (and including if this
Agreement is terminated for any reason) (i) to the extent that the Seller, the
Company or any Member has any liability or obligation to Buyer for monetary
damages, Buyer's sole recourse with respect to any such liability shall be to
the Company and (ii) no recourse hereunder or under any documents or
instruments delivered in connection herewith may be made against the Seller or
any officer, agent or employee of the Seller or any direct or indirect holder
of any equity interests or securities of the Seller, any Affiliate of the
Seller, or any direct or indirect director, officer, employee, partner,
affiliate, member, controlling person or representative of any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall (x) relieve any Party from liability for any willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement or (y)

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

prevent Buyer from seeking equitable remedies, including under Section 11.10,
against the Seller or any Member.

  

  

ARTICLE X 
 

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 10.1 Indemnification Obligations of the Seller.

  

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article X, from and after the Closing,
the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any and
all Losses arising out of:

  

  

(i) any breach, or the failure to be true and correct, of any representation
or warranty made by the Company in Article III or by the Seller in Article IV;

  

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by the Seller
or, prior to the Closing, the Company, in this Agreement; and

  

  

(iii) any unpaid Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness as of the Effective Time
and/or Change of Control Payments, in each case to the extent not paid or
taken into account in the determination of the Closing Date Indebtedness
Statement, the Closing Date Financial Certificate or the Final Closing
Statement pursuant to Article II.

  

  

(b) The Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this Section 10.1
as to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Buyer Losses". Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, for the sole purpose of
determining the amount of Buyer Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy
of a representation or warranty set forth in Article III or Article IV, except
as set forth in Section 3.8(b), any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers or words of similar import contained in such representation or
warranty giving rise to the claim of indemnification hereunder shall in each
case be disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification
were deleted from such representation or warranty); provided, however, that
for the avoidance of doubt, any such qualifiers or words of similar import
shall be taken into effect when determining if such a breach or inaccuracy of
a representation or warranty has occurred or exists.

  

  

Section 10.2 Indemnification Obligations of Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless each of the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of:

  

  

(a) any breach, or the failure to be true and correct, of any representation
or warranty made by Buyer in Article V; and

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Buyer in this
Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

The Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties described in this Section 10.2 as
to which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
collectively referred to as "Seller Losses".

  

  

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedure.

  

  

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice from a third
party of a threatened or filed complaint or the threatened or actual
commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding (a "Third Party
Claim") with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall provide written
notification to Buyer or the Seller, whichever is the appropriate indemnifying
Party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party"), within ten (10) days after the
Indemnified Party's notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such
Third Party Claim except to the extent, and only to the extent that, such
failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the
Indemnifying Party of material rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or (ii) material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days thereafter (or sooner if the
nature of the Third Party Claim so requires), to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the Seller shall not have the right to defend a Third Party Claim if such
Third Party Claim includes a claim that any Intellectual Property owned by, or
exclusively licensed to, Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
infringes or violates, or constitutes or results from a misappropriation of,
any such Intellectual Property (an "IP Claim"), in which case Buyer may elect
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and be entitled to settle or
compromise such Third Party Claim with the consent of Seller (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (with the reasonable
expenses and any settled or compromise amounts constituting Buyer Losses
hereunder) and the Seller shall have the right to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but Buyer shall
control the investigation and defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
declines, fails or is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim within such twenty (20) day period,
however, the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in
any such Third Party Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party agrees that such
Third Party Claim is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss in
question, the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such counsel as incurred; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any
single Third Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action,
shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at such Party's own expense; provided, however, if the Indemnifying
Party agrees that such Third Party Claim is a matter with respect to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying Party
for the Loss in question, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the out of pocket
expenses of

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

such Indemnified Party's counsel if the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to such Indemnifying Party, or if
available to such Indemnifying Party, the assertion of which would be adverse
to or in conflict with the interests of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all
times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the
defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each
other with respect to the defense of any such matter.

  

  

(b) No Party may consent to the entry of any judgment, settle or compromise
any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of
the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, the Indemnifying Party may enter into a judgment
or settlement without the consent of the Indemnified Party if (i) such
judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money and does not
result in any financial or other obligation of the Indemnified Party, (ii)
Indemnifying Party makes such payment in full pursuant to the terms hereof and
(iii) the applicable Indemnified Parties receive an unconditional full and
final release related to such Third Party Claim; and provided, further, that
the foregoing limitation does not apply to any IP Claim.

  

  

(c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
Agreement not involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall send
written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim. As
promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such
Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall work together
in good faith to establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual
agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise). Within five (5) Business
Days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim
(whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise), the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay all sums so due and owing to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party; provided, that, if
the Seller is the Indemnifying Party and any Buyer Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party, the Seller shall, first, cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
such Buyer Indemnified Party such sums out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and,
second, if such sums exceed the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount, then the
Seller shall pay such sums in cash, in each case, in immediately available
funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder, if any.

  

  

Section 10.4 Claims Period. The Claims Period hereunder shall begin on the
date hereof and terminate as follows:

  

  

(a) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under Section 10.1(a)(i) with respect
to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in Section 3.1
(Organization), Section 3.2 (Authorization), Section 3.3 (Capitalization),
Section 3.4 (Company Subsidiaries), Section 3.18 (Certain Fees), Section 4.1
(Organization), Section 4.2 (Authorization), Section 4.3 (Company

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Share Ownership) or Section 4.6 (Certain Fees) (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations"), the Claims Period shall terminate on the date that is four
(4) years following the Closing Date;

  

  

(b) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under (i) Section 10.1(a)(i) and (ii)
under Section 10.1(a)(ii), other than (A) with respect to any breach or
inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations, (B) as provided for in
Article XII or (C) covenants to be performed after the Closing, the Claims
Period shall terminate on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date;

  

  

(c) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under Section 10.1(a)(ii) with
respect to covenants to be performed after the Closing, the Claims Period
shall survive the Closing either until the time period set forth in the
applicable covenant (or, if no time period is set forth therein, until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations); and

  

  

(d) with respect to Seller Losses arising under Section 10.2(a), the Claims
Period shall terminate on the date that is four (4) years following the
Closing Date.

  

  

(e) with respect to Seller Losses arising under Section 10.2(b), the Claims
Period shall survive the Closing for the time period set forth in the
applicable covenant (or if no time period is set forth, until the expiration
of the applicable statutes of limitations).

  

  

No claim for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the Claims
Period; provided, however, if prior to the close of business on the last day
of the Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified
of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally
resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and
shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally
resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

  

  

Section 10.5 Liability Limits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Seller's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold
the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless shall be limited as follows:

  

  

(a) no amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 10.1 unless
and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have suffered Buyer Losses in
excess of $1,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount") in the aggregate, in which case
the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to recover the amount of
Buyer Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts of indemnity for Buyer Losses (i)
pursuant to Sections 10.1(a)(i) with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, (ii) pursuant to Article XII, (iii) pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(ii) with respect to covenants to be performed after the Closing, (iv)
pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii) or (v) for fraud, in each case, shall not be
subject to the Threshold Amount;

  

  

(b) in no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid by
the Seller pursuant to Section 10.1 or otherwise exceed the Indemnity Escrow
Amount (the "Buyer Cap"); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
amounts of indemnity for Buyer Losses (i) pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(i) with
respect to the Fundamental Representations, (ii) pursuant to

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

Article XII, (iii) pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(ii) with respect to covenants
to be performed after the Closing, (iv) pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii) or
(v) for fraud ((i)-(v), the "Special Indemnities"), in each case, shall not be
subject to the Buyer Cap but shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price;

  

  

(c) notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, other than
indemnification obligations of the Seller with respect to the Special
Indemnities, (i) any indemnification obligation of the Seller under this
Agreement shall be satisfied solely from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (ii) if
the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy the Buyer Losses, then
the Buyer Losses in question will remain unsatisfied;

  

  

(d) notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, all the
indemnification obligations of the Seller (including with respect to the
Special Indemnities) shall be first paid out of (and otherwise reduce the
remaining amount of) the Indemnity Escrow Fund before any claim is made
against any other Person thereafter;

  

  

(e) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of indemnifiable claims
against the Seller, the amount of each claim for Buyer Losses by a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments
by the Seller pursuant to Section 10.1 shall be limited to, the amount of such
Buyer Losses that remain after deducting therefrom (i) any third party
insurance proceeds, and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment
actually received from any third party with respect thereto, and (ii) any net
Tax benefit (calculated without regard to any Transaction Deductions) actually
realized in the taxable year of the indemnification payment by a Buyer
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Buyer Losses or
items giving rise to such claim for indemnification;

  

  

(f) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to Section 10.1 with respect to
any Buyer Loss shall be reduced to the extent such Buyer Loss is reflected on
the Closing Date Indebtedness Statement or the Final Closing Statement;

  

  

(g) in any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, no Party shall be
required to indemnify any Person for punitive, special, exemplary or
consequential damages, including loss of profit or revenue, any multiple of
reduced cash flow, interference with operations, or loss of tenants, lenders,
investors or buyers, except to the extent for amounts paid to a third party
where any of the foregoing are awarded pursuant to a Third Party Claim that is
subject to indemnification hereunder;

  

  

(h) any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this Article X shall be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss including taking any actions
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and an Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable to the
Indemnified Party's failure to mitigate; provided, that an Indemnified Party's
obligation to mitigate any Loss shall not include any obligation or
requirement that (i) such Indemnified Party or any of his or its Affiliates
assume or incur any material Liability or (ii) would reasonably be expected to
materially disrupt, or otherwise materially affect the business or operations
of such Indemnified Party or any of his or its Affiliates;

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(i) in any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from any third party
any net amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Seller has
indemnified Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such Buyer Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Seller the amount so recovered; and

  

  

(j) any indemnity payment under this Agreement pursuant to this Article X
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

  

  

Section 10.6 Member Obligations. Each Member hereby severally (in accordance
with its Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any failure of
the Seller to pay any amounts which it is obligated to pay under Section 6.5
and this Article X with respect to Losses arising out of the Special
Indemnities. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Member have any
obligation hereunder with respect to any indemnification obligation of the
Seller other than with respect to the Special Indemnities. The Parties agree
that any claims for indemnification with respect to the Special Indemnities
(but not with respect to Section 6.5) must be first satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund as contemplated by Section 10.5(d) before any claim can
be made against a Member pursuant to this Section 10.6. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Member shall have any joint
and several liability under this Agreement, and in no event shall any Member
be obligated to provide any payment under this Agreement or otherwise in
excess of its Pro Rata Percentage of the Purchase Price. In no event shall any
Member have any obligation with respect to any breach of this Agreement by any
other Member. Each Member represents and warrants, with respect to itself,
himself or herself only, that (i) such Member has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder; (ii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such Member, and when duly executed by all parties hereto and
delivered by such Member, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of such Member, enforceable against such Member in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws affecting
the enforceability of creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles and the discretion of courts in granting equitable remedies.

  

  

Section 10.7 Exclusive Remedies. Other than in the event of fraud, the
provisions of this Article X, Section 11.10 and Article XII hereof set forth
the exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties to seek or obtain damages or
any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any Party with respect to matters
arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without in any way limiting the provisions of this
Section 10.7, the Parties agree that, excluding fraud or any claim for
injunctive or other equitable relief, the indemnification provisions of this
Article X and Article XII are intended to provide the sole and exclusive
remedy as to all claims against either the Company, the Seller or the Members
(it being acknowledged and agreed that, other than as provided in Sections
10.5(c), 10.5(d) and 10.6 and except in the case of fraud or any claim for
injunctive or other equitable relief, the Seller and the Members shall have no
liability under this Agreement apart from their beneficial interests in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund), on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
arising from or relating to this Agreement and the agreements and documents

Section 11.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement,
or the application of any such term or provision, is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, all other terms, conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 11.4 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of,
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned, directly or indirectly, including by operation of law, by any
Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

  

  

Section 11.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided in
Sections 6.6 and 11.6, this Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of the
Company and the Seller, and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
with respect to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and for the
benefit of Buyer, and its respective successors and permitted assigns, with
respect to the obligations of the Company and the Seller under this Agreement,
and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other
third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or
other right.

  

  

Section 11.6 Section Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in
this Agreement are exclusively for the purpose of reference shall not in any
way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.7 Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.6(d) hereof, each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any Legal
Dispute shall be subject only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Delaware or the United States federal courts

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. During
the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this Section 11.7
is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to
such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim,
cross-claim or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court. Each Party hereby waives, and shall not assert, as a defense in
any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not subject to such jurisdiction,
(b) such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in such court, (c) such Party's property is exempt or immune from execution,
(d) such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or
(e) the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper. A final judgment
in any action, suit or proceeding described in this Section 11.7 following the
expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during
appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws.

  

  

Section 11.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the other
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement including all exhibits and

to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction,
effect, performance and remedies.

  

  

Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any
breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the
Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy.

  

  

Section 11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the
Agreement.

Section 11.13 Schedules. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto
referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement to the
extent such disclosure in another Section is reasonably apparent based on the
subject matter of such Schedules and Sections. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is not intended to imply
that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.14 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  

  

Section 11.15 Conflict Waiver. King and Spalding LLP has represented the Company
and the Seller. All Parties recognize the commonality of interest that exists
and will continue to exist until Closing, and the Parties agree that such
commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after the Closing.
Specifically, Buyer agrees that (a) it shall not, and shall not cause the
Company to, seek to have King and Spalding LLP disqualified from representing
the Seller or the Seller's Affiliates in connection with any dispute that may
arise between such parties and Buyer or the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) in
connection with any such dispute, Seller or Seller's Affiliates involved in
such dispute (and not Buyer or the Company) will have the right to decide
whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that may apply to any
communications between the Company and King and Spalding LLP that occurred prior
to the Closing.

  

  

Section 11.16 Non-Recourse. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or any other document, certificate or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto, or the negotiation, execution, performance or non-
performance of this Agreement or any other document, certificate or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto (including any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or any other document, certificate or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) may be made only
against the Persons that are expressly identified as Parties hereto or
thereto. In no event shall any named Party to this Agreement or the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto have any shared or vicarious liability for
the actions or omissions of any other Person. No Person who is not a named
party to this Agreement or the other documents delivered pursuant hereto,
including without limitation any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of
any named party to this Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any
Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or affiliates) for any obligations or Liabilities arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement or any other document,
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto or for any claim based on,
in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or any other document,
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto or its negotiation or
execution; and each party hereto or thereto waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims and

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Non-Party Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of

of this Article XII shall control.

  

  

Section 12.2 Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and pay to the Buyer

Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof)
(A) for any taxable period ending at or prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
for the portion of any Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time
(determined as provided in Section 6.5); (ii) the failure of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.13 to be true and
correct in all material respects or the failure to perform any covenant
contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes; (iii) any liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the application of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous or similar provision under Tax
law) as a result of having been a member of an Affiliated Group at any time
prior to the Closing; and (iv) any failure by the Seller to timely pay any and
all Taxes required to be borne by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement,
calculated in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iv) above without
regard to any Transaction Deductions.

  

  

Section 12.3 No Tax Claim Limitation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, claims for indemnification for Losses in respect to
Taxes under this Article XII shall not be subject to the limitations of
Section 10.5(a) or (b). In no event shall liability of Seller under this
Article XII exceed the Purchase Price.

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency whereof is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

  


 

  

1. Investment of the Escrow Funds. Escrow Agent will invest and reinvest each Escrow Fund at the written direction of the Seller. The Seller may direct the investment of the Escrow Funds in money market funds authorized to invest in short-term securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government and repurchase agreements with respect to such securities (including any money market fund managed or sponsored by Escrow Agent and any of its Affiliates) (the "Permitted Investments"). Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute the directed purchase and sale of Permitted Investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets operations. In the event that Escrow Agent does not receive written investment instructions to invest an Escrow Fund from the Seller, Escrow Agent shall invest such Escrow Fund, until receipt of joint written investment instructions from the Seller to the contrary, in [_________________]1. Escrow Agent or any of its Affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder. It is expressly agreed and understood by the parties hereto that Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be liable for losses on any investments, including, but not limited to, losses from market risks due to premature liquidation or resulting from other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement, unless any such losses are attributable to Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the delivery of each Escrow Fund is subject to the sale and final settlement of Permitted Investments. Proceeds of a sale of Permitted Investments will be delivered to, or at the direction of, the Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Receipt, investment and reinvestment of each Escrow Fund shall be confirmed in
writing in accordance with Section 5 by Escrow Agent to the Buyer and the
Seller as soon as practicable following the end of each calendar month by
account statement. For purposes of this Section 1, each account statement
shall be deemed to have been received if delivered in accordance with Section
5 or if made available for online access pursuant to the written request of
the Buyer and/or the Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Business Day" shall mean any day of the year, excluding Saturday, Sunday and
any other day on which national banks are required or permitted to close in
Sunnyvale, California or Charlotte, North Carolina.

Escrow Agent's Distributions of the Escrow Funds.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

(a) Distributions. Escrow Agent shall distribute each Escrow Fund, or any
portion thereof, only pursuant to this Section 2.

  


 ________________________

  

 

1 To be inserted following discussions between the Buyer, the Seller and U.S.
Bank. The Buyer's expectation is that this will be a money market account that
has no withdrawal or maturity limitations.

  

 

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

(b) Automatic Distributions. With respect to distributions required to be made
by Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2(d), 2(f) or 2(g) below (the "Automatic
Distributions"), such distributions shall be made by Escrow Agent as provided
in such sections without joint written certification and instruction from the
Buyer and the Seller or a Final Order (as defined below).

  


 

  

(c) Distribution on Joint Certification and Written Instructions or Final
Order. Other than with respect to the Automatic Distributions, Escrow Agent
shall distribute each Escrow Fund only (i) in accordance with the joint
written certification and instructions of the Buyer and the Seller or (ii)
pursuant to a Final Order. A "Final Order" shall mean (i) a settlement
agreement signed by the Buyer and the Seller or (ii) a certified copy of a
final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction determining the
rights of the Buyer and the Seller with respect to the applicable Escrow Fund,
which has been finally affirmed and is not subject to appeal.

  


 

  

(d) Income Distribution.

  


 

  

(i) All income or losses from the investment of the Escrow Funds (the
"Investment Income" and the "Investment Losses", as applicable) shall be
taxable (in the case of Investment Income) or allocated (in the case of
Investment Losses) to the Seller.

  


 

  

(ii) The Investment Income shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Seller as soon as practicable following the end of each calendar year.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to
the Seller pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Escrow Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax Laws, in each case, as
amended or succeeded. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Seller in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided
that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts as soon as
reasonably practicable to provide to Escrow Agent such information or tax
forms as Escrow Agent requests in connection with its obligations under the
appropriate tax Laws applicable in respect of withholding, backup withholding
and information reporting including, without limitation, the Seller's taxpayer
identification number and Form W-9.

  


 

  

(iii) Escrow Agent shall report such Investment Income or Investment Losses on
such tax returns as required by the IRS and any state and local departments of
revenue in all years Investment Income is earned, or Investment Losses are
suffered, as and to the extent required under the provisions of the Code.
Except for the obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence,
Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to prepare or file any income or other
tax returns applicable to the Investment Income and Investment Losses.

  


 

  

(iv) Upon the final distribution of the Purchase Price Adjustment

the Seller all net undistributed Investment Income on such Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund through the date of such final distribution. Upon the
final distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2(g)
below, Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Seller all net undistributed
Investment Income on such Indemnity Escrow Fund through the date of such final
distribution.

amount to be distributed to the Buyer from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund and, if the Purchase Price Adjustment Fund has been exhausted,
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (iii) providing payment instructions for
the amount to be so distributed to the Buyer, then within five (5) Business
Days of receipt of the Adjustment Notice, Escrow Agent shall (x) pay to the

Fund, as applicable, the amount set forth in the Adjustment Notice and (y)
after the payment set forth in clause (x), distribute any remaining portion of

(i) At any time and from time to time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
on [_________]2, 2014 (such date being referred to as the "Final Distribution
Date"), the Buyer may, but shall not be obligated to, deliver to Escrow Agent
any number of written certificates and instructions (each, an "Indemnification

Notice demonstrating that the Buyer or the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party
is or is not entitled to indemnification for such Claim Amount (or another

Party determined pursuant to (A) or (B) shall promptly be paid to the Buyer or
the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with the procedures set
forth herein no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after Escrow Agent's

Liability and Duties of Escrow Agent.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

The Buyer and the Seller hereby appoint Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment and agrees to act, as escrow agent in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The acceptance by Escrow Agent of
its duties and obligations under this Agreement is subject to the following
terms and conditions, which the parties to this Agreement hereby agree shall
govern and control with respect to Escrow Agent's rights, duties, liabilities
and immunities:

  

  

(a) Except for acts of fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct, Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by it or on its behalf in good faith in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment. Escrow Agent
may at any time consult with independent legal counsel of its own choice in
any such matters, shall have full and complete authorization and protection
from any action taken or omitted by it hereunder in accordance with the advice
of such legal counsel on its part and shall incur no liability for any delay
reasonably required to obtain the advice of any such legal counsel. Escrow
Agent shall not be answerable for the default or misconduct of any agent or
legal counsel employed or appointed, at its discretion, by it if such agent or
legal counsel shall have been selected with reasonable care;

  


 

  

(b) The Buyer and the Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless Escrow Agent and its employees, directors and officers from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, claims, actions or demands
whatsoever which may be brought against Escrow Agent or which it may suffer or
incur as a result of or arising out of the performance of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement, other than those resulting from the fraud,
gross

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent, its partners,
employees, agents, directors, officers, successor or assigns. The Buyer and
the Seller agree solely among themselves that any obligation for the
indemnification under this Section 3 shall be borne by the Buyer and the
Seller in proportion to such party's respective responsibility, if any, of
such loss, liability, cost, damage or expense, or, if neither the Buyer nor
the Seller bears greater responsibility than the other, then 50% by the Buyer
and 50% by the Seller. It is understood and agreed that this indemnification
shall survive the termination or discharge of this Agreement or the
resignation of Escrow Agent;

  


 

  

(c) Escrow Agent and its partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns
shall not be liable for any damage, loss or destruction of any of the
documents held hereunder due to fire, flood, tornado, act of God, theft, or
any other similar causes not resulting from the fraud, gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent or its employees, agents,
successors or assigns;

  


 

  

(d) Escrow Agent and its employees, agents, successors and assigns shall have
no duty to know or determine the performance or non-performance of any
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement except as expressly
required or contemplated in the performance by Escrow Agent of the functions
contemplated to be performed by it under this Agreement. Escrow Agent may act
in reliance upon any written instrument or signature believed by it to be
genuine and may assume that the person purporting to give advice or make any
statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so. The duties and responsibilities of Escrow Agent
are purely administrative in nature and are limited to those expressly stated
herein;

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to and shall not
restrict or remove any other rights which Escrow Agent may have at law or in
equity to seek relief or direction from any court of competent jurisdiction in
addition to such as are expressly set forth herein;

  


 

  

(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to disregard any and all notices or warnings, other than written
notices given by or on behalf of the Buyer or the Seller or their respective
counsel, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey any and
all Final Orders. If Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such Final Order,
Escrow Agent and its partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall
not be liable to any of the other parties hereto or anyone else by reason of
such compliance, notwithstanding any such Final Order being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, or vacated, or being subsequently
found to have been issued or entered into without jurisdiction;

  


 

  

(g) Escrow Agent may resign from its position at any time upon thirty (30)
days prior written notice to the Buyer and the Seller. In addition, the Buyer
and the Seller may jointly remove Escrow Agent at any time for any reason
whatsoever, by an instrument given to Escrow Agent, which instrument shall
designate the effective date of such removal. Upon such resignation or
removal, Escrow Agent shall take such steps as are necessary to assign this
Agreement and transfer any property held in escrow to a successor escrow agent
agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller, and, where such agreement is not
obtained within seven (7) Business Days

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

after Escrow Agent's resignation or removal, then to any court of competent
jurisdiction. Upon such resignation or removal, Escrow Agent shall be
discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in connection
with this Agreement other than (i) liabilities resulting from a breach of this
Agreement by Escrow Agent prior to the date of such resignation or removal and
(ii) to retain and safeguard the Escrow Funds then in its possession until
receipt of a designation of successor escrow agent or a joint written
disposition instruction by or on behalf of the Buyer and the Seller or a Final
Order;

  


 

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Escrow Agent to expend
its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any
of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, or do
anything not expressly provided for herein, except in relation to acts of
fraud, gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent or
its employees, agents, successors and assigns; and

  


 

  

(i) In the event that (i) there is a disagreement between the Buyer and the
Seller resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with
either of the Escrow Funds, (ii) Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it
should take hereunder or (iii) Escrow Agent needs clarification as to any
instructions it has received from the parties hereunder, Escrow Agent, in its
discretion, shall be entitled to retain the applicable Escrow Fund until
Escrow Agent shall have received a Payment Authorization. Escrow Agent shall
act on such Payment Authorization without further question, and shall have no
liability for so doing except in relation to acts of its fraud, gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

4. Compensation of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall be entitled to reasonable fees and reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including, but not by way of limitation, the reasonable fees and costs of outside legal counsel or agents which it may find necessary to engage in performance of its duties hereunder, in accordance with the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B; provided, however, that Escrow Agent shall give two (2) Business Days prior written notice to the Buyer and the Seller of its intention to engage counsel. The Buyer and the Seller hereby agree that they shall each be responsible for payment of fifty percent (50%) of all fees and expenses of Escrow Agent that are otherwise payable or reimbursable under this Agreement, and the Seller hereby authorizes the Escrow Agent to deduct any portion of such fees and expenses (not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)) for which the Seller is responsible from the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

  


 

  

5. Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been given when delivered personally or by electronic mail, or the following Business Day if sent via a nationally recognized overnight courier (delivery confirmation requested).

6. Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Buyer shall be permitted to assign all or part of its rights or obligations hereunder (i) to its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (ii) by way of collateral assignment to any lender providing financing for the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Seller shall not be permitted to assign all or part of its rights or obligations hereunder (other than to its Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the Buyer. Other than in accordance with Section 3(h), Escrow Agent shall not be permitted to assign all or part of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Buyer and the Seller.

  


 

  

7. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term of this Agreement, such provision shall be fully severable, this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible

  


 

  

8. No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the Buyer and the Seller to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any person.

  


 

  

9. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed as if no heading had been used in this Agreement.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one person, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission of documents, and such facsimile will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party.

  


 

  

11. Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  


 

  

12. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Buyer, the Seller and Escrow Agent (or Escrow Agent's duly qualified successor).

  


 

  

13. Termination of Escrow Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect unless and until (a) all Escrow Funds are distributed in full or (b) it is terminated in a written instrument executed by the Buyer and the Seller. Termination of this Agreement shall not impair the obligations of the Buyer and the Seller set forth in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 18, which such obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and, in the case of Section 3 and Section 4, shall survive only for a period of three (3) years following such termination.

  


 

  

14. Merger or Consolidation. Any banking association or corporation into which Escrow Agent (or substantially all of its corporate trust business) may be merged, converted or with which Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which Escrow Agent shall be a party, shall succeed to all Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

  


 

  

15. Funds Transfer. In the event funds transfer instructions are given subject to the terms and conditions hereof (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing or by electronic mail, Escrow Agent may seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated in Section 5 hereof, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the reasonable confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable.

  


 

  

It is understood that Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
number provided by either of the other parties hereto to identify (a) the
beneficiary, (b) the beneficiary's bank or (c) an intermediary bank. Escrow
Agent may apply any of the Escrow Funds for any payment order it

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank.

  


 

  

16. Security Advice Waiver. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that regulations promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency grant the Buyer and the Seller the right to receive brokerage confirmation of security transactions as they occur. The Buyer and the Seller specifically waive such right to notification to the extent permitted by law and acknowledge that the Buyer and the Seller will receive periodic cash transaction statements, which will detail all investment transactions, in accordance with the final paragraph of Section 1.

  


 

  

17. Identifying Information. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that a portion of the identifying information set forth in Section 2 and Section 5 is being requested by Escrow Agent in connection with the USA Patriot Act, Pub.L. 107-56 (the "Act"), and the Buyer and the Seller agree to provide any additional information reasonably requested by Escrow Agent in connection with the Act or any similar legislation or regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely manner. The Buyer and the Seller each represent that all of their respective identifying information set forth in Section 2 and Section 5, including without limitation, their respective taxpayer identification number assigned by the IRS or any other taxing authority, is true and complete on the date hereof and in the event such information regarding a party changes subsequent to the date hereof, such party will promptly notify Escrow Agent of such change.

  


 

  

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, United States federal Law requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an
account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a
trust, or other legal entity, Escrow Agent may ask for documentation to verify
its formation and existence as a legal entity. Escrow Agent may also ask, to
the extent required under applicable law, to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. To this
extent, upon reasonable request of the Escrow Agent, please provide all
contact information for parties to the Agreement including taxpayer
identification numbers.

  


 

  

18. Income Tax Allocation. The parties agree, for tax purposes, to treat the amounts held in the Escrow Funds as owned by the Seller and not received by the Buyer, in all cases to the extent not paid to the Buyer pursuant to Section 2, and to file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such treatment. The parties agree that for tax reporting purposes, all Investment Income and Investment Losses shall be treated (and reported to the IRS) as having been received by the Seller for United States federal income Tax purposes.

ENTITY TRANSFEROR

  

  

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
provides that a transferee of a "U.S. real property interest" (as defined in
the Code) must withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S.
tax purposes (including Section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity
(which has legal title for a U.S. real property interest under local law) will
be the transferor and not the disregarded entity. To inform Trimble Navigation
Limited, a California Corporation ("Buyer"), that withholding of tax is not
required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by TMW Systems
Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Seller"),as the sole
stockholder of TMW Intermediate Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of Seller:

  

  

    

1.

Regulations).

2.

  |

§1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii).

3.

  |  

Seller's U.S. employer identification number is 30-0334311.

Revenue Service by Buyer, and that any false statement contained herein could
be punished by fine, imprisonment or both.

  

  

Under penalties of perjury, the undersigned officer of Seller declares that he
or she has examined this certificate and, to the best of his or her knowledge
and belief, it is true, correct and complete, and he or she further declares
that he or she has authority to sign this document on behalf of Seller.
