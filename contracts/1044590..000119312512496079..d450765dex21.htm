ARTICLE III

_CONVERSION OF SHARES_

 

 _Section 3.1 Conversion of Shares_.

(a) Each share of the Companys common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "
_Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive $10.00 in cash without any interest thereon (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

 



-12-  (b) Each Dissenting Share shall at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under 
_Section 3.3_.

 

(c) Each share of common stock, $.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common
stock, $.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Any shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(e) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately
prior to the Effective Time of shares of outstanding Common Stock not
represented by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
shares of outstanding Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock other than the
right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in
accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, for each such share of Common Stock held by them.

(f) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.1(a)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 3.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action with respect to the Common Stock that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

_Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver, in trust, to a paying
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time,
sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration Fund_ ") to
be paid pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ in respect of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares, excluding the Dissenting Shares. In the event the Consideration
Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration payable under _Section 3.1_ , Parent shall promptly deliver, or
cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that
is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments.

 



-13-  (b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose
shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1_  (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and
instructions shall be substantially in the form as reasonably agreed to by the
Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a
Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry
Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than
a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, in the sole discretion of the
Paying Agent, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Book-
Entry Share or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate with
respect to its Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
such investments shall be in money market mutual or similar funds having
assets in excess of $10 billion. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No
investment or loss of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments
required by this _Article III_ (or relieve Parent from fulfilling the Other
Payment Obligations).

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 3.2(b)_ , at and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares
of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
III_ , except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



-14-  (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Surviving
Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to Surviving
Corporation, and Surviving Corporation shall remain liable, for payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof. 

(f) Notwithstanding _Section 3.2(e)_ , neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the
Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Surviving Corporation, and any holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to
Surviving Corporation for payment of such holders claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and (if required by
Parent) providing a customary indemnity and bond, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this _Article III_.

(h) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a
Person pursuant to this Agreement any amounts that are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of any such payment under applicable
Tax Law and with respect to any payment pursuant to  _Section 3.4_ any
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the applicable deduction and withholding was made.

 

 _Section 3.3 Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than _Section 3.3(b)_ to
the contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands (and has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such demand) appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) such stockholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of
such stockholders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, but shall
instead be entitled only to such rights to receive payment with respect to
such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such stockholder under Section 262
of the DGCL.

 



-15-  (b) The Company shall promptly provide any written notices of dissent or
demands for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock to Parent, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in any negotiations and proceedings with
respect to each such dissent or demand. Except with the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer
to settle or settle, any such dissent or demand, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

(c) If any stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholders right to
obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and
the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholders shares
of Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_ , without interest, upon
compliance with the exchange procedures set forth in _Section 3.2_.

_Section 3.4 Treatment of Equity Awards; Company Equity Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase Common Stock under a Company
Equity Plan (an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time and, if not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time, and the holder of such Option will, in full
settlement of such Option, be entitled to receive from Parent an amount,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and without interest, in cash
equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration less the exercise price
per share of such Option multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Option (such product, the " _Option Consideration_ ");
_provided, however_ , that if the per share exercise price payable with
respect to an Option exceeds the Merger Consideration (an " _Underwater
Option_ "), then such Underwater Option shall be cancelled without payment of
any consideration with respect thereto.

 

(b) _Company Stock-Based Awards_. Each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive shares of Common Stock or benefits measured by the value
of a number of shares of Common Stock or the performance of the Company, and
each award of any kind consisting of shares of Common Stock, granted or
payable under any of the Company Equity Plans, including restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance share units or other stock-based
awards (each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), that is outstanding and,
with respect to performance share units, is deemed payable, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested and payable, as applicable,
and all applicable forfeiture or other restrictions thereon shall lapse,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the holder of such Company Stock-
Based Award will, in full settlement thereof, be entitled to receive from
Parent an amount, subject to any required withholding of Taxes and without
interest, in cash equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
product, the " _Stock-Based Award Consideration_ ").

 



-16-  (c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the 2008 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), the Company shall (i) continue to operate the
ESPP in accordance with its material terms during the current "Offering
Period" (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date hereof, (ii)
suspend the commencement of any future "Offering Period" (as defined in the
ESPP) after the date of this Agreement, and (iii) terminate the ESPP as of the
Effective Time.

 

(d) _Certain Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to effect the provisions
of this _Section 3.4_ and to terminate all of the Company Equity Plans as of
the Effective Time. The Company shall also amend, as of the Effective Time,
the provisions of any other Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer
or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Equity Rights to provide no continuing rights to acquire, hold, transfer or
grant any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Equity Rights. Except as otherwise contemplated herein, any such then
outstanding rights or other Equity Rights shall be canceled immediately prior
to the Effective Time without any payment therefor, and the Company shall
take all steps to ensure that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is or
will be bound by any options, warrants, rights or agreements which would
entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to own any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Equity Rights or to
receive any payment in respect of the foregoing.

(e) _Payment for Equity Awards_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation

and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

other than immaterial violations of any provision of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

January 1, 2011 (such documents, together with amendments and supplements
thereto and any reports filed during such period by the Company with the SEC
on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended or superseded by information in a subsequent
filing or submission, as of the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing prior to the date of this Agreement, each of the Company
SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be and in
each case as in effect on the date so filed or furnished. As of their
respective dates, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
that the information in such Company SEC Report has been amended or
superseded by a later Company SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof. The
Company has made available to Parent copies of all comment letters received by
the Company from the SEC since January 1, 2011 relating to the Company SEC

-21-  (c) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal controls
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

(d) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure
that all material information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of such disclosure
controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses within their knowledge in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud within their
knowledge, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls with
respect to financial reporting. Since January 1, 2011, no material complaints
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
material concerns from employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are
reasonably credible and allege any questionable accounting or auditing
matters, have been received by the Company that are unresolved. The Company
has made available to Parent all material written disclosures made
by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company
Board since December 31, 2010. For purposes of this _Section 4.5_ , the terms
"significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meaning
assigned to them in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this
_Section 4.5_ , "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley

listing and rules and regulations of the NYSE.

obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,

material respects of Parents and Merger Subs representations in _Section
5.3_), and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any

such Benefit Plan; (ii) the most recent annual report (Form 5500 series and

submitter plan entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the
favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS to the sponsor of such
prototype or volume submitter plan. To the knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred which has resulted or which could reasonably be expected to

that will not be satisfied prior to the Effective Time, other than required

Subsidiaries has any material obligations for medical or life insurance
benefits subsequent to termination of employment to employees or their
beneficiaries under any Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement except
(i) as required by applicable Laws, (ii) the continuation of coverage through
the month of termination if required pursuant to such Benefit Plan, (iii)
disability benefits attributable to disabilities occurring prior to

Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit Plan subject to the laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) if intended to qualify for

with respect thereto, except, only to the extent any claim is not prohibited
to be made against the Company hereunder, as expressly and specifically
covered by a representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_.
Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that, without
limiting the generality of this _Section 5.12(b)_, neither the Company nor
any Person acting on behalf of the Company has made any representation or
warranty with respect to such projections and other forecasts, plans and
information, except, only to the extent any claim is not prohibited to be
made against the Company hereunder, as expressly and specifically covered by a
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_.

of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, investment

_Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not unreasonably
disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Contracts, assets,
properties, books, management and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, in support thereof, the Company shall reasonably promptly
comply with reasonable information requests of Parent regarding the Company;

 



-40-    _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Merger Sub to
the extent such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company
after taking into account the advice of outside counsel, (a) violate
applicable Law or materially breach the provisions of any Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (b) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided that the Company shall
enter into a joint defense agreement or other agreement with the Parent to
enable preservation of such attorney-client or other legal privilege).
The Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to allow the Parent or its
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours, to enter upon the properties owned, operated, or leased by the Company
or its Subsidiaries for the purpose of conducting qualitative and non-
intrusive environmental assessments and related work. Parent agrees that the
confidentiality letter, dated August 15, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
officers, employees, and other Representatives hereunder.

_Section 6.3 Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ , from the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, the Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, nor shall it permit its or its Subsidiaries Company Representatives to,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Company Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage
or knowingly facilitate the submission, announcement or making of, any
Acquisition Proposal by any Person; (ii) furnish or otherwise provide access
to any non-public information regarding any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
to any Person in connection with, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except to state that such
discussions or negotiations are not permitted pursuant to these provisions;
or (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under, or fail to enforce any
standstill provision concerning an Acquisition Proposal or any confidentiality
provision of a confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with a
transaction that would qualify as an Acquisition Proposal, except to the
extent that the Company Board determines in good faith that such grant or
release would result in a Superior Proposal being made by the Person subject
to such standstill or confidentiality provision. Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_
, promptly after the date hereof the Company shall cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation, encouragement, knowing facilitation, discussion
or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Company Representatives with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Within two (2) Business Days of the date hereof,
the Company shall request each Person that executed a
confidentiality agreement within the past year in connection with any
transaction that would qualify as an Acquisition Proposal if proposed after
the date hereof to return or destroy all non-public information furnished by
or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Company Representatives.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(a)_
, if at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial and outside legal
advisors) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal (provided
such

 



-41-   Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of _Section
6.3(a)_ , this _Section 6.3(b)_ or _Section 6.3(c))_ , (A) furnish information
(including non-public information) with respect to it and its Subsidiaries to
any Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the
terms of which shall not be less restrictive to the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent, and (B) engage or participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that prior to taking any action described in the foregoing clauses
(A) or (B), (x) the Company Board shall have also determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (y) the Company shall have provided at least 24 hours prior
notice to the Parent that it intends to take any of the actions described in
the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) and (z) the Company shall have complied in
all material respects with all of its obligations in Section 6.3(a), this
Section 6.3(b) and Section 6.3(c). From and after the date hereof, if the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, it shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt thereof) (i) advise Parent in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions thereof and
shall disclose the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed with respect to the status
of any such Acquisition Proposal and any material changes thereto, including
providing Parent copies of all material draft agreements with respect thereto,
in each case within 24 hours of receipt by the Company, Subsidiaries or its
Company Representatives. In connection with furnishing or otherwise permitting
the transmittal of any material non-public information to any Person pursuant
to this _Section 6.3(b)_ , the Company shall (as a condition to furnishing or
otherwise permitting the transmittal of such non-public information to such
Person) concurrently furnish such non-public information to Parent to the
extent it has not been previously furnished or made available by the Company
to Parent.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.3_ , neither the Company
Board, nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (a " _Change
of Recommendation_ "), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or understanding (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Acquisition Proposal, other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_
, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within two Business Days after
request by Parent or make any public statement that conflicts with the
Company Recommendation, or (v) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement; _provided, however_ , that if the Board effects a Change
of Recommendation pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_, then the requirements set
forth in the foregoing clauses (ii)-(v) of this _Section 6.3(c)_ shall not
apply with respect to such Superior Proposal after such Change of
Recommendation.

(d) Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, if the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board
determines in good faith is a Superior Proposal, then (x) the Company Board
may effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior 

 



-42-   Proposal and (if desired) (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to
enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
(subject to Article VIII), but only if: (1) the Company has not materially
breached its obligations under 
_Section 6.3(a)_, _Section 6.3(b_ ),and _Section 6.3(c)_ , (2) the Company
Board shall have determined, after good faith consultation with its
legal counsel, that its failure to effect a Change of Recommendation or to
enter into such Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (3) the Company shall have notified Parent in
writing that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to
a Superior Proposal or that it intends to enter into an Acquisition Agreement
to effect such Superior Proposal (a " _Proposal Notice_ "), with such notice
specifying, the party making the Superior Proposal, a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of
the Acquisition Agreement and all other agreements and material documents
related thereto, and (4) the Company shall have allowed Parent three (3)
Business Days following receipt of the Proposal Notice to submit a proposal (a
" _Subsequent Parent Proposal_ ") that the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel, to
cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal and during such three Business Day period the
Company and its Company Representatives shall meet with the Parent and its
Representatives and negotiate in good faith during such period with respect to
a Subsequent Parent Proposal (provided that if Parent makes a Subsequent
Parent Proposal and there is subsequently any material change to the financial
or other material terms of the Superior Proposal prior to the Companys
effecting a Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement, such
proposal shall be considered a new Superior Proposal for purposes of this
_Section 6.3(d)_ and the Company shall comply with its obligations under this
Section 6.3(d) with respect to such new Superior Proposal, including providing
Parent a new Proposal Notice and providing Parent with a period of two (2)
Business Days after the receipt of such new Proposal Notice to make another
Subsequent Parent Proposal, which will be otherwise subject to the provisions
of this _Section 6.3(d)_ ). Except immediately prior to the entry into an
Acquisition Agreement in compliance with the terms of this _Section 6.3_ and
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or as otherwise required by _Section 6.12_ , the Company
shall not waive the Delaware Takeover Statue or the Washington Takeover
Statute.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation
of applicable Law; provided that the Company shall to the extent practicable
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on and review
any such disclosure. Provided the Company Board publicly reaffirms its
approval and recommendation of this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days
after a request by Parent to do so, no such disclosure of a position shall
constitute a Change of Recommendation for the purposes of this _Section 6.3_.
In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this _Section
6.3_ , a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of _Section
6.3_ of the Agreement with respect thereto, and contains "stop-look-and-
listen" or similar communication shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation.

 



-43-  (f) For purposes of this Section 6.3 and all of the defined terms in this
Section 6.3, the term "Company Board" shall be deemed to mean the Company
Board and/or the Special Committee, as applicable.

 

 _Section 6.4 Employee Benefits_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, and for a period through December 31, 2013,
Parent agrees to provide or cause its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) to provide each of the employees of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
who were employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with base salary or
wage rates, incentive compensation opportunity and other cash compensation
that, in the aggregate, are not less than those in effect for such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and with employee
benefits and perquisites (including retirement, health and life insurance
benefits but excluding benefits under any defined benefit plans, equity
compensation plans, or any other plan or agreement terminated pursuant to, or
in connection with, this Agreement) that, in the aggregate, are no less
favorable to each Continuing Employee (and such Continuing Employees spouse
and dependents) than those in effect under Benefit Plans for such Continuing
Employee (and his or her spouse and dependents) immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) As of the Effective Time, except as to those severance
arrangements described in _Section 6.4(c)_, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, honor, pay, perform
and satisfy any and all contractual liabilities arising under the terms of all
incentive, bonus, individual benefit, employment, employment termination,
severance and other compensation agreements, plans and arrangements, including
the Companys change-in-control and general severance and retention plans, in
each case existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement and
all of which are identified on _Section 6.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, that are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director or employee thereof or for the benefit of
any such current or former officer, director or employee.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate, effective no
later than the Effective Time, (i) each of the nonqualified deferred
compensation arrangements listed on Section 6.4(c)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that distributions on account of such
termination need not occur until after the Effective Time; and provided
further that the Company shall not be required to terminate any such plans or
programs or distribute payments in connection with any such termination if
such termination or payment would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation of Section 409A of the Code or any other applicable Law; and (ii)
each of the severance programs listed in _Section 6.4(c)(ii)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) On and after the Closing Date, no employee shall be entitled to severance
except on the basis of the plans and policies generally applicable to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (taking into
account the recognition of prior service if relevant which is required by
_Section 6.4(e)_ below); _provided, however_ , that for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Effective Time (x) all Continuing Employees in the
United States shall be

 



-44-   treated as "Eligible Employees" under the applicable severance plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries, (y) the amount of severance of any such Eligible
Employee who receives severance benefits under the applicable plan or policy
of Parent and its Subsidiaries will be in the same amount as the total cash
payments such Eligible Employee would have received under the applicable
Company severance plan as such plan existed immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (z) any such Eligible Employee who receives severance
benefits will be provided with outplacement assistance substantially similar
to that which would have been provided under the applicable severance plan
of Company, as such plan existed immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, severance for Continuing
Employees in the United States will be provided only on and subject to the
conditions of the applicable plan or policy of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
This _Section 6.4(d)_ shall not apply in the case of any employee covered by
or entitled to the benefits of any severance arrangement described in _Section
6.4(b_) which is not otherwise to be terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.4(c)_.

(e) Parent shall treat, and shall cause each benefit plan, program, practice,
policy and arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the
Continuing Employees participate or are eligible to participate (the "
_Parent Plans_ ") to treat, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, and the amount of severance, vacation, sick leave and
other paid time off benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under
any other Parent Plans), and for purposes of paying, providing or satisfying
when due all vacation, sick pay and other paid time off benefits accrued but
unused as of the Effective Time, all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company, any
Subsidiary or any Benefit Plan provides past service credit) as service with
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Surviving
Corporation). Parent shall cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-
existing condition limitations and other exclusions and limitations with
respect to the Continuing Employees and their spouses and dependents to the
extent waived, satisfied or not included under the analogous Benefit Plan, and
(ii) to recognize for each Continuing Employee for purposes of
applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such
Parent Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the
Continuing Employee and his or her spouse and dependents under the analogous
Benefit Plan during the plan year of such Benefit Plan in which occurs the
later of the Effective Time and the date on which the Continuing Employee
begins participating in such Parent Plan.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company in consultation with Parent shall
comply with all obligations under applicable Law to provide information to any
foreign employees or their representatives and otherwise comply with all
obligations under applicable Law to inform or consult trade unions, works
councils or other employee representative bodies in connection with the
matters contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer
upon any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
representative of any such employee, or any Governmental Entity or other third
party any rights, claims, benefits, causes of actions or remedies, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any period 

 



-45-   or terms of employment, of any nature whatsoever, (ii) except with respect
to the obligations of Parent expressly set forth in _Section 6.4(b)_ and
_Section 6.4(d)_, be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates from modifying or terminating the
employment or terms of employment of any Continuing Employee, including the
amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program or arrangement, after the Effective Time or (iii) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plan or arrangement.

 

 _Section 6.5 Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any
of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make
any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making
any such public announcement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor Parent will be required to obtain the prior agreement of or
consult with the other party in connection with any such press release or
public announcement (a) if the Company Board has effected a Change of
Recommendation or in connection with any such press release or public
announcement pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_ or (b) if the information and other
content contained therein has been previously included in any press release
or public announcement after compliance with the terms of this _Section 6.5_
__.

_Section 6.6 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the six year anniversary of the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall (and if the Surviving Corporation for
any reason cannot, the Parent shall) indemnify and hold harmless the
individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or
officers of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries or
corporate parents (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities in connection with
actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and
advance expenses with respect thereto, in each case as provided, as
applicable, in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and in any
indemnification agreements between the Company and any Indemnified Party
entered into prior to the date hereof and a copy of which has been provided to
Parent. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification
and advancement of expenses set forth in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as amended, restated and in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and any indemnification agreements between the Company and any
Indemnified Party shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and such provisions and agreements
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by Law.

 



-46-  (b) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (or such other insurance
policy with the same coverage and amounts with terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous than the Companys existing policies) for the
Indemnified Parties and any other employees, agents or other individuals
otherwise covered by such insurance policies prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the Company may at its option prior to the Effective Time
purchase a six-year run-off program for directors and officers

termination of this Agreement by the Company, within three (3) Business Days
after such termination. " _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall mean $24,000,000.
The payment of any Parent Termination Fee shall be by wire transfer of same
day funds to an account designated by the Company.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.2(b)_ and  _8.2(c)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements, the other
parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that the Termination Fee and
the Parent Termination Fee are not penalties but rather constitute liquidated

 



-56-   damages for losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, in connection with this Agreement and the
termination thereof, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay Parent by
wire transfer of same day funds all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within two (2) Business Days
following delivery by Parent of reasonable documentation of such fees and
expenses; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to pay more than
$1,500,000 pursuant to this _Section 8.2(e)_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including 
_Section 9.2_ ) but subject to the last sentence of _Section 8.2(a)_ , (x)
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, in the event that
the Termination Fee or fees and expenses shall become payable pursuant to 
_Section 8.2(b)_ or _(e)_ and Parent shall receive payment as required by
_Section 8.2(b) or (e)_ , the right to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ or such fees and expenses pursuant to  _Section 8.2(e)_,
as applicable, shall constitute each of Parents, Merger Subs, and each of
their Affiliates and Representatives, sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement (provided that if Parent receives payment of fees and expenses
pursuant to _Section 8.2(e)_ it shall retain the right to receive a
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ in accordance with the terms
thereof) and (y) the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in the event that
the Parent Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_
and the Company shall receive payment as required by _Section 8.2(c)_, the
right to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 8.2(c)_
shall constitute the Companys and each of its Affiliates and Company
Representatives, sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payment by the Company under  _Section 8.2(b)_ or by
the Parent under _Section 8.2(c)_, shall be payable only once with respect to
such section, even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions of such section.

and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken

to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, and (iii) the
right of the holders of Options or Company Stock-Based Awards to receive the
Option Consideration or Stock-Based Award Consideration, respectively, as set
forth in _Section 3.4(e)_, are not intended to confer upon any Person other

_Section 9.7 Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, void, unenforceable or against regulatory
policy, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to
modify

in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
to be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court

jurisdiction, a United States federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware,
in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery in the State
of Delaware or a United States federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of the parties shall have the right to
bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the
Chancery Court in the State of Delaware or any United States federal court
located in Wilmington, Delaware in any other court or jurisdiction.

_Section 9.10 Specific Performance_. Other than as specifically described
in  _Section 8.2_, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that,
in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching party would be
irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary
damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive, in

law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
may be entitled at law or in equity, to seek an injunction or injunctions or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted

purported assignment hereof not in compliance with this _Section 9.11_ shall
be null and void.

_Section 6.8(d)_ and  _Section 8.2(e)_), all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the

Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

_Section 9.14 Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

_Section 9.15 Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
