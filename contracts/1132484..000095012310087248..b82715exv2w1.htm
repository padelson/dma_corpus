   ARTICLE II 
   

  



  

   _Conversion  of Securities_  

  



  

  Section 2.01. __Conversion  of Capital Stock_._ At the Effective Time,
by  virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the  holder
of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per  share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common  Stock_ "), or the holder of any shares of capital
stock  of Sub: 

  



  

  (a) __Capital Stock of Sub_._ Each  issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value  $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become
one  fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value  $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  



  

  (b) __Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned  Stock_._ All shares
of Company Common Stock  that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or
owned by  Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall 
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no  consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange  therefor. 

  



  

  (c) __Conversion of Company Common  Stock_._ Each share of Company Common
Stock  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time 
(other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with  Section 2.01(b) and
(ii) except as provided in  Section 2.02, the Appraisal Shares) shall be
converted into  the right to receive $27.00 in cash, without interest (the 
" _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time  such shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each  holder of a certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry
form  that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any  such
shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to  have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to  receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of  this Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of
Company  Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be  subject
to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is  required under
applicable tax Law, such withholding to be  pursuant to the terms of Section
2.03(f) and any applicable  tax Law. 

  



  

  Section 2.02. __Appraisal  Rights_._ Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal  Shares_ ") of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any  holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal  of such 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the  provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL  (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted  into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided  in Section
2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be  entitled to payment of the fair
value of such shares in  accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At
the  Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be  outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease  to exist, and each
holder of a certificate or evidence of shares  in book-entry form that
immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with  respect thereto, except the right to receive
the fair value of  such shares in accordance with the provisions of  Section
262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such  holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw  or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 or a court  of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is  not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then 
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such  holders
Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall  cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been  converted at the Effective Time into, and shall
have become, the  right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in 
Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to  Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company  Common Stock, withdrawals of
any such demands and any other  related instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the  Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and  direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such 
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written  consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle  or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do or commit  to do any of the foregoing. 

  



  

  Section 2.03. __Exchange  of Certificates_._ (a) __Paying  Agent_._ Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent  shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to  the Company to act as agent for the payment of the
Merger  Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the  " _Paying Agent_
"), and, from time to time after  the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available, or cause the  Surviving Corporation to make available, to the
Paying Agent  funds in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment
of  the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon  surrender of
Certificates, it being understood that all such  funds shall be invested as
directed by Parent and that any and  all interest or other amounts earned
with respect to funds made  available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall  be turned over to Parent. 

  



  

  (b) __Exchange Procedure_._ As soon as  reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving  Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to  each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of
letter  of transmittal (which shall include an accompanying substitute 
IRS  Form W-9  or the applicable IRS  Form W-8,  shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss  and title to the Certificates
held by such person shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying  Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions  (including customary provisions regarding delivery of an 
"agents message" with respect to shares held in  book-entry form) as Parent
may reasonably specify and which  shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company) and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the 
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon  surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent  or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent,  together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and  validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably be  required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate  shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of  cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the  right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the  Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the  event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is  not registered in the stock transfer books of
the Company,  payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may
be  made to a person other than the person in whose name the  Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate  shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any  transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a  person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or  establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that  such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall  be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of  any Certificate. 

  



  

  (c) __No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common  Stock_._ All Merger
Consideration paid upon the  surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
the terms of this  Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full 
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company  Common Stock
formerly represented by such 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the  Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company  shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of  transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving  Corporation of the shares that were outstanding
immediately  prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business
on  the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are  presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for  transfer or any other
reason, they shall be canceled and  exchanged as provided in this Article
II. 

  



  

  (d) __No Liability_._ None of Parent,  Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent  shall be liable to any person in respect of
any Merger  Consideration that would otherwise have been payable in respect 
of any Certificate which is delivered to a public official in  accordance
with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or  similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered  immediately prior to the date
on which any Merger Consideration  would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any  Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration payable in 
accordance with this Article II in respect thereof shall,  to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property  of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or  interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (e) __Lost Certificates_._ If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person  claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or 
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the  posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving  Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may  be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying  Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall  pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, 
defaced or destroyed Certificate. 

  



  

  (f) __Withholding Rights_._ Parent,  the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled  to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of  Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving 
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and  withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the  Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or 
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and  paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having  been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in  respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  



  

  (g) __Termination of Fund_._ At any  time following the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date,  the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the  Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest  received with respect thereto) that had been made available to 
the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and that have  not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter,  subject to the time
limitations in Section 2.03(d), such  holders shall be entitled to look only
to Parent and the  Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or  other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect
to  the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon 
surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as  determined pursuant
to this Agreement, without any interest  thereon.

  Section 3.01. __Representations  and Warranties of the Company_._ Except
as set  forth in the letter (with specific reference to the Section of  this
Agreement to which the information stated in such  disclosure relates;
_provided_ , that disclosure contained  in any section of the Company Letter
shall be deemed to be  disclosed with respect to any other Section of this
Agreement to  the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such  disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other  Section
of this Agreement) delivered by the Company to Parent  prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Company  Letter_ "), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent  and Sub as follows: 

  



  

  (a) __Organization, Standing and Corporate  Power_._ Each of the Company
and its  Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation or other legal entity  duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the  Laws of

does not recognize such concept),  (ii) has all requisite corporate, company,
partnership or  other organizational power and authority to carry on its 
business as currently conducted and (iii) is duly qualified  or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction (except, in the
case of good standing, any  jurisdiction that does not recognize such
concept) in which the  nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of  its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary,  other than where the failure to be so organized, existing, 
qualified or licensed or in good standing (except, in the case  of clause (i)
above, with respect to the Company) is not  reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company  has made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of the  certificate of incorporation of the Company, as
amended to the  date of this Agreement (the " _Company  Certificate_ "), and
the bylaws of the Company, as  amended to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company  Bylaws_ "), and the certificate of incorporation and  bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of each of its  Subsidiaries, in each case
as amended to the date of this  Agreement. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and  correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft
minutes,  the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the 
stockholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of the  Board of
Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries  held since January 1,
2008 (other than portions of any  minutes (or drafts thereof) related to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or any Takeover Proposal). The 
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies  of all

by the Company, by one or more wholly  owned Subsidiaries of the Company or
by the Company and one or  more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company,

interests  or other encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever 
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), except for transfer  restrictions imposed by
applicable securities Laws, and are duly  authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Except  for the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests  in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly
or  indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests
in, any person. 

  



  

  (c) __Capital  Structure_._ (i) The authorized capital  stock of the
Company consists of 500,000,000 shares of  Company Common Stock and 5,000,000

is  no plan, Contract or arrangement providing for the grant of  Stock
Options, Restricted Shares or RSUs. No shares of Company  Preferred Stock are
issued or outstanding. No shares of Company  Common Stock are owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company.  Section 3.01(c)(i) of the Company Letter sets

or exchangeable or exercisable for, or  options, warrants, shares of deferred
stock, restricted stock  awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock
awards or other  rights to acquire any such capital stock of, or other equity

other  equity or voting interests in, the Company, other than issuances  of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of  Stock Options or

  appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other similar  rights) issued
by, or other obligations of, the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, that are linked to, or the  value of which is in any way based upon or
derived from, the  value of any class of capital stock of, or other equity
or  voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the  value
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any part  thereof, or any
dividends or other distributions declared or  paid on any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or  voting interests in, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or  which have or which by their terms may have at any time
(whether  actual or contingent) the right to vote (or which are  convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the  right to vote) on any
matters on which stockholders of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
vote (the items referred  to in clauses (A) and (B) collectively,  " _Equity
Equivalents_ "). Except as set forth in  this Section 3.01(c) or contemplated
by  Section 4.01(a) of the Company Letter, there are no  securities,
options, warrants, calls, rights or Contracts of any  kind to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,  or by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound,  obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue,  deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold,  additional shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting 
interests in, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or  exercisable
for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or  voting interests in, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or  obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue,  grant, extend or enter into any such security,
option, warrant,  call, right or Contract. With respect to the Stock
Options,  (1) each Stock Option intended to qualify as an  "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the  Code so qualifies, (2) each grant of a
Stock Option was  duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant
of  such Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the  " _Grant Date_
") by all necessary corporate  action, including, as applicable, approval by
the Board of  Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and
authorized  committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the 
necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award  agreement
governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and  delivered by each party
thereto, (3) each such grant was  made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company  Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable
Laws and  regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of The New 
York Stock Exchange and any other exchange on which Company  securities are
traded, (4) the per share exercise price of  each Stock Option was not less
than the fair market value  (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
in the case  of each Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive 
stock option" and within the meaning of Section 409A  of the Code, in the
case of each other Stock Option, other than  any Stock Option that is exempt
from Section 409A of the  Code due to the effective date provisions thereof)
of a share of  Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date and  (5)
each such grant was properly accounted for in  accordance with GAAP in the
financial statements (including the  related notes) of the Company and
disclosed in the  Companys SEC Documents in accordance with the Exchange
Act  and all other applicable Laws. Except pursuant to the forfeiture 
conditions of the Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs  outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement and except pursuant  to the cashless exercise
or tax withholding provisions of such  Stock Options, Restricted Shares and
RSUs, in each case as in  effect on the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding  contractual or other obligations of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries to (I) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire  any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests in, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or  (II) vote or dispose of any shares of capital stock
of, or  other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries. The Company is not a party to any voting agreement  with

referred to in clauses (A) through (U) of this  subsection (i) are
collectively referred to in this  Agreement as " _Specified Contracts_ ". The
Company  has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of each 
of the Specified Contracts, including all amendments thereto.  Each Contract
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is  material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a  " _Material Contract_ ") is in full
force and  effect (except for those Contracts that have expired in 
accordance with their terms) and is a legal, valid and binding  agreement of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,  and, to the knowledge of
the Company, of each other party  thereto, enforceable against the Company or
such Subsidiary, as  the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
against  the other party or parties thereto, in each case, in accordance 
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.  Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has performed or is  performing all material
obligations required to be performed by  it under the Material Contracts and

the Company, no other party to any of the  Material Contracts is (with or
without notice or lapse of time  or both) in material breach or default
thereunder. To the  knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement,  there has occurred no event giving (with or without notice or 
lapse of time or both) to others any right of termination,  material
amendment or cancelation of any Material Contract. To  the knowledge of the
Company, as of the date of this Agreement,  there are no circumstances that
are reasonably likely to occur  that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the  ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
perform its  material obligations under any Material Contract.

failed to renew or requested any material amendment  to any of its Major

business not  adverse in any material respect to the Company or its 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), with the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries.

 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  similar authorizations from any Governmental Entity  (collectively, "
_Permits_ ") that are necessary  for them to own, lease or operate their
properties and assets  and to carry on their businesses in all material
respects as  currently conducted, except where the absence of such Permits 
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the  Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  Section 3.01(j) of the Company Letter
sets forth, as of the  date of the Agreement, a complete and correct list of
the  Permits that are material, individually or in the aggregate, to  the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since February 1, 2007  has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all  applicable Laws and Judgments, and, to the
knowledge of the  Company as of the date of this Agreement, no condition or
state  of facts exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to a  material
violation of, or a material liability or default under,  any such applicable
Law or Judgment. The execution and delivery  of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation  of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement and compliance with the terms hereof are
not  reasonably likely to, cause the revocation or cancelation of any 
material Permit. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the  Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written  communication during the
three year period prior to the date of  this Agreement from any person that
alleges that the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance in

Law  or Judgment or relating to the revocation or modification of any 
material Permit. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the  Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice that  any investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity is  pending with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries  or any of the material assets or operations of the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries or that any such investigation or
review  is contemplated.

adopted, entered into, established, terminated, amended or  modified or
agreed to adopt, enter into, establish, terminate,  amend or modify (or
announced an intention to adopt, enter into,  establish, terminate, amend or
modify) any collective bargaining  agreement or any bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred  compensation, incentive compensation, equity or equity-

written, formal or  informal, funded or unfunded and whether or not legally
binding  or subject to the Laws of the United States) sponsored, 
maintained, contributed to or required to be sponsored,  maintained or
contributed to by the Company, any of its  Subsidiaries or any other person
or entity that, together with  the Company, is treated as a single employer
under  Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or  with respect to which
the Company is otherwise jointly or  severally liable under applicable Law
(each, a " _Commonly  Controlled Entity_ "), in each case, providing 
compensation or benefits to any Company Personnel, including the  Company
Stock Plans, but not including the Benefit Agreements  (all such plans,
programs, policies, arrangements and  understandings, including any such
plan, program, policy,  arrangement or understanding entered into, adopted
or  established on or after the date of this Agreement,  collectively, "
_Benefit Plans_ "), or has made any  change in any actuarial or other
assumption used to calculate  funding obligations with respect to any Pension
Plan, or any  change in the manner in which contributions to any Pension
Plan  are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined. 

  



  

  (ii) There are no collective bargaining or other labor  union agreements
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  is a party or by which any
of them is bound. Between  February 1, 2007 and the date of this Agreement,
neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has encountered any  labor
union organizing activity, or had any actual or, to the  knowledge of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement,  threatened employee strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or  lockouts and, to the knowledge of the Company as of
the date of  this Agreement, no labor union organizing activity, strike,
work  stoppage, slowdown or lockout is threatened. None of the  employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is  represented by any labor union,
works council or similar  organization with respect to his or her employment
by the  Company or such Subsidiary. The Company and its Subsidiaries do  not
have any obligation (including to inform or consult with any  such employees
or their representatives in respect 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement)
with respect to any such organization. Each of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and since February 1, 2007  has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all  applicable Laws and Judgments relating to labor
relations,  employment and employment practices, occupational safety and

has not, engaged in  any unfair labor practice. As of the date of this
Agreement,  there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against 
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the  knowledge of the
Company, threatened, in each case before the  National Labor Relations Board
or any comparable Governmental  Entity. As of the date of this Agreement, no
question concerning  representation has been raised or is, to the knowledge
of the  Company, threatened respecting the employees of the Company or  any
of its Subsidiaries. No grievance or arbitration proceeding  arising out of a
collective bargaining agreement is pending or,  to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (l) __Environmental  Matters_._ (i) Each of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries is, and has been, in compliance in all material  respects with

and, as of  the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its

Company Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all  "employee
welfare benefit plans" (as defined in  Section 3(1) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act  of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), all 
"employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in  Section 3(2) of ERISA)
(each, a " _Pension  Plan_ ") and all other Benefit Plans and Benefit

Agreement. The Company has made available to Parent  complete and correct
copies of the following with respect to  each Benefit Plan and Benefit

  (ii) Each Pension Plan intended to be tax qualified under  the Code has
been the subject of a favorable determination,  qualification or opinion
letter from the U.S. Internal  Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect

to provide a determination letter to the effect that  such Pension Plan is
qualified and exempt from United States  Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a),  respectively, of the Code, and no such letter has been
revoked  (nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has revocation been 
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most  recent such
letter or application therefor relating to any such  Pension Plan that is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the  qualification of such Pension Plan
or materially increase the  costs relating thereto or require security
under  Section 307 of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan required to have  been

contribute to, or has any actual or  contingent liability under, any 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Benefit Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" (as  defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA) or a "multiemployer  plan" (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of  ERISA), or that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV  of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or that is otherwise a  defined benefit
pension plan or that provides for the payment of  termination indemnities,
other than any such plan that is  sponsored by a Governmental Entity, and

liability with  respect to any such plan (under Title IV of ERISA or 
otherwise). 

  



  

  (iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that provides  welfare benefits,
whether or not subject to ERISA (each, a  " _Welfare Plan_ "), is funded
through a  "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in  Section
419(e) of the Code), or is unfunded or  self-insured. There are no
understandings, agreements or  undertakings, written or oral, that would
prevent any Welfare  Plan (including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or
other  former employees) from being amended or terminated without  material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at  or at any time after
the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan  provides benefits, and there are no
understandings, written or  oral, with respect to the provision of welfare
benefits, after  termination of employment, except where the cost thereof
is  borne entirely by the former employee (or his or her eligible 
dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by  Section 4980B(f) of the Code
or any similar state statute  or foreign Law. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied  in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of  Section 4980B(f) of the Code,  Sections 601-609  of ERISA
and any similar state statute or foreign Law with  respect to each Benefit
Plan that is a "group health  plan" (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code or  any similar state statute).

entitled to  any additional compensation, severance or other benefits or
any  acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any  compensation,
severance or other benefits as a result of the  Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (alone or in combination with
any other event, including any  termination of employment on or following the
Closing), or any  compensation or benefits the value of which would be
calculated  on the basis of the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any  other
event, including any termination of employment on or  following the Closing),
(B) the names of all Company  Personnel entitled to any such compensation or
benefits actually  payable as of the Closing Date or upon termination of

and (E) the aggregate value of any such compensation or  benefits that would
be paid to each individual set forth in  Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company
Letter as of the Closing  Date and upon termination of employment. Except as

to any severance, separation, change in control,  termination, bonus,
retention or other additional compensation  or benefits or any acceleration
of the time of payment or  vesting of any compensation or benefits as a
result of the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  (alone or in combination with any other event, including any 
termination of employment on or following the Closing) or any  compensation
or benefits related to or contingent upon, or the  value of which will be
calculated on the basis of, the Merger  and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone  or in combination with any other
event, including any  termination of employment on or following the Closing).
The  execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of  the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (alone or
in combination with any other event,  including any termination of employment
on or following the  Closing) and compliance by the Company with the
provisions of  this Agreement do not and will not (A) trigger any funding 
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost  of, or give
rise to any other obligation under, any Benefit  Plan, Benefit Agreement or
any other employment arrangement,  (B) trigger the forgiveness of
Indebtedness owed by any  Company Personnel to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or  (C) result in any violation or breach of, or a default  (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both)

in connection with each Benefit Plan and  Benefit Agreement that are required
to have been made by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance
with the terms  of such Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement and applicable

related thereto, requires or permits a retroactive  increase in premiums or
payments on termination of such Benefit  Plan or such insurance Contract.
Neither the Company nor any of  its Subsidiaries has incurred, or could
reasonably be expected  to incur, any unfunded liabilities in relation to any
Benefit  Plan or Benefit Agreement.

if any, such  restrictions would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement,

  (iii) No later than five business days prior to the Closing  Date, the

  Section 4.02. __No  Solicitation_._ (a) Notwithstanding any  provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall  not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries  to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any director, officer or  employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any  investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor
or  representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,  directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly  encourage, or take any
other action to knowingly facilitate, any  Takeover Proposal or any inquiries
or the making of any proposal  that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal  or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in 
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any  person (or any
representative thereof) any information knowingly  with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with any  person (or any representative
thereof) knowingly with respect  to, any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval,
in  response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board  of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes  or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,  and which Takeover
Proposal did not result from a breach of this  Section 4.02, the Company may,
and may permit and authorize  its Subsidiaries and its representatives and
its  Subsidiaries representatives to, in each case subject to  compliance
with Section 4.02(c), (A) furnish  information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to  the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its 
representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement which  contains
terms as to confidentiality that are no less  restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement dated as of July 1, 2010 between
Parent and the  Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the  "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), _provided_   that all such information had
been provided, or is concurrently  provided, to Parent, and (B) participate
in discussions or  negotiations with, and only with, the person making such 
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such  Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the  restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence
by any  director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or  other advisor
or representative of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of this  Section 4.02(a) by the Company. 

  



  

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover  Proposal_ " means
(x) any inquiry relating to, or  that could reasonably be expected to lead
to, or (y) any  proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent
or  Sub or any of their Affiliates) for, in one transaction or a  series of
transactions, any merger, consolidation, business  combination,
recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution  involving the Company or any
direct or indirect acquisition,  including by way of any merger,
consolidation, tender offer,  exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding  share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization,  liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement
or  similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that  constitute or
represent 15% or more of the total revenue, net  income, EBITDA or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of
the outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital
stock  of, or other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the 
Subsidiaries of the Company which, in the aggregate, directly or  indirectly
hold the assets or businesses referred to in  clause (i) above; _provided_
that clause (x) of  this paragraph shall be inapplicable to clause (i) of
the  immediately preceding paragraph and to Section 4.02(c). 

   
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior  Proposal_ " means
any binding bona fide written offer  which did not result from a breach of
Section 4.02(a) made  by any person (other than Parent or Sub or any of
their  Affiliates) that, if consummated, would result in such person  (or,
in the case of a direct merger between such person and the  Company, the
stockholders of such person) acquiring, directly or  indirectly, more than
50% of the voting power of the Company  Common Stock or all or substantially
all the assets of the  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
which offer,  in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (after consultation with a financial advisor of national  reputation
and outside legal counsel), (i) provides  consideration which is more
favorable to the stockholders of the  Company than the consideration provided
in the Merger (taking  into account all of the terms and conditions of such
offer and  this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this 
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior  Proposal or
otherwise which are binding on Parent)) and  (ii) is reasonably capable of
being completed, taking into  account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of  such proposal. 

  



  

  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any  committee
thereof shall (or shall agree or resolve to)  (i) withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or  Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify
in a manner  adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of 
advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee of  this
Agreement or the Merger (any such action, resolution or  agreement to take
such action being referred to herein as an  " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"),  (ii) recommend, declare advisable or propose to recommend  or declare
advisable, the approval or adoption of any Takeover  Proposal or resolve or
agree to take any such action, or adopt  or approve any Takeover Proposal, or
(iii) cause or permit  the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of  understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement,  merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, 
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an  " _Acquisition Agreement_
") constituting or  related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably
likely to  lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality 
agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)), or resolve or  agree to take any
such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing or  any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, at any  time prior to the Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors  of the Company may, in response to a Superior
Proposal or an  Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, 
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company  determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside  legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized  reputation, that the failure to do so is
reasonably likely to  result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders  of the Company under applicable Law, and _provided_  
_further_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may  not effect such
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless  (A) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have first  provided prior written notice to Parent (an "
_Adverse  Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to  effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a  Superior Proposal or an
Intervening Event, which notice shall  not constitute a breach of this
Section 4.02(b) and shall,  in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the
most current  version of any written agreement relating to the transaction 
that constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an  Intervening
Event, attach information describing such  Intervening Event in reasonable
detail, and (B) Parent does  not make, within five business days after the
receipt of such  notice, a binding proposal that would, in the good faith 
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after  consultation with a
financial advisor of national reputation and  outside legal counsel), (x)
cause the offer previously  constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a  Superior Proposal or (y) obviate the need for an Adverse 
Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event (it  being
understood and agreed that any amendment or modification  of such Superior
Proposal (other than a non-substantive  amendment or modification) shall
require a new Adverse  Recommendation Change Notice and a new three business
day  period). The Company agrees that, during the five or three  business
day period, as applicable, prior to its effecting an  Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company and its officers,  directors and representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with  Parent and its officers, directors and
representatives regarding  any revisions to the terms of the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. 

  



  

  For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Intervening  Event_ " means an
event, circumstance, fact or other  information, unknown to the Board of
Directors of the Company as  of the date of this Agreement, which becomes
known prior to the  Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that in 
no event shall the receipt, 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating  thereto
or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event. 

  



  

  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth  in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 4.02,  the Company shall, as promptly as possible
and in any event  within 24 hours after the Companys receipt thereof, 
advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover  Proposal or any
request for information or inquiry that the  Company reasonably believes
could lead to or contemplates a  Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and
conditions of such  Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry (including any
subsequent  amendment or other modification (other than any immaterial 
amendment or modification, which shall be provided promptly to  Parent) to
such terms and conditions) and the identity of the  person making any such
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.  Commencing upon the provision of any
notice referred to above,  the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (A) on
a daily  basis at a mutually agreeable time, advise Parent (or its  outside
counsel) of the progress of negotiations concerning any  Takeover Proposal,
the material resolved and unresolved issues  related thereto and any other
material matters identified with  reasonable specificity by Parent (or its
outside counsel) and  the material details (including material amendments or
proposed  amendments as to price and other material terms) of any such 
Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (B) promptly upon  receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside  counsel) with copies of all
material documents and material  written or electronic communications
relating to any such  Takeover Proposal (including the financing thereof),
request or  inquiry exchanged between the Company, its Subsidiaries or any 
of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment  bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or  representatives, on the one
hand, and the person making a  Takeover Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or
their respective  officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys,  accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the other 
hand. 

  



  

  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or  elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from  (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position  contemplated by  Rule 14d-9  and  Rule 14e-2(a) 
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any  disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of  the Board of Directors of the
Company, failure so to disclose  would be inconsistent with applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board 
of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to  take any
action prohibited by Section 4.02(b). 

  



  

  Section 4.03. __Conduct  by Parent_._ During the period from the date of 
this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in  writing by
the Company prior to such action or as specifically  contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not  permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, take any action that is  reasonably likely to result in (a) any
representation and  warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement
that is  qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or 
(b) any such representation and warranty that is not so  qualified becoming
untrue in any material respect.

  Section 5.01. __Preparation  of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders 
Meeting_._ (a) As promptly as reasonably  practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company  shall prepare and, no later than the tenth
calendar day (or, if  such calendar day is not a business day, on the first
business  day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the 
date of this Agreement, file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy  Statement.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement  to the contrary, (x) if
the Company does not receive  comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary Proxy  Statement, absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect
of  preventing such action, the Company shall file with the SEC the 
definitive Proxy Statement, and shall cause the mailing of the  definitive
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company,  on or prior to the
second business day after the tenth calendar  day immediately following the
date of filing of the preliminary  Proxy Statement with the SEC, and (y) if
the Company does  receive comments from the SEC with respect to the
preliminary  Proxy Statement, absent any Legal Restraint that has the
effect  of preventing such action, the Company shall file with the SEC  the
definitive Proxy Statement, and shall cause the mailing of  the definitive
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the  Company, on or prior to the
second business day 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  immediately following clearance by the SEC with respect to such  comments.
Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all  information concerning such
person to the other as may be  reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing  and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall  promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the  SEC
or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for  amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall  provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between it and  its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other  hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
commercially  reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any  comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the  Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or  responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, and  unless the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have received  a Takeover Proposal or made an Adverse
Recommendation Change,  the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity
to  review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall  include in
such document or response all comments reasonably  proposed by Parent and
(iii) shall not file or mail such  document, or respond to the SEC, prior to
receiving the approval  of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or  delayed. If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting,
any  information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their  respective
Affiliates, officers or directors should be  discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in  an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the  Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a  material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be  stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements  therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are  made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information  shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto, and an  appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information  shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by 
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.  If the
Company receives a Takeover Proposal (or any subsequent  material amendment
or material modification to any such Takeover  Proposal) or if an Intervening
Event occurs, the ten calendar  day periods referenced in this Section
5.01(a) and the two  business day period referenced in clause (y) of the
second  sentence of this Section 5.01(a) will be extended in each  such
circumstance by three calendar days. 

  



  

  (b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply  as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the  Exchange Act and that
none of the information included or  incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the  date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or
mailed to the  stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Stockholders  Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state 
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in  order to
make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except  that no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to  statements made in the Proxy Statement based on
information  supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Sub 
specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference  therein. Parent
agrees that none of such information will, at  the date the Proxy Statement
is filed with the SEC or mailed to  the stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the  Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or 
supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material  fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in  light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not  misleading. 

  



  

  (c) As promptly as practicable after the date of this  Agreement, the
Company shall, in compliance with applicable Law,  the Company Certificate,
the Company By-Laws and the rules of  The New York Stock Exchange, establish
a record date (which will  be as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date of  this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold  a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company shall, 
absent any Legal Restraint that has the effect of preventing  such action,
cause to occur on the 30th calendar day (or,  if such calendar day is not a
business day, on the first  business day subsequent to such calendar day)
immediately  following the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement (the  "
_Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of  obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, regardless of whether the  Board of Directors of the Company
determines at any time that  this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the  stockholders of the Company reject it or any other
Adverse  Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain  a quorum of its
stockholders at such time, the Company may  adjourn the Stockholders Meeting
if necessary in order to obtain  a quorum of its 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  stockholders and the Company shall use its commercially  reasonable
efforts to obtain such a quorum as promptly as  practicable, (ii) the Company
may adjourn or postpone the  Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to
the extent) the  Company reasonably determines that such adjournment or 
postponement is required by applicable Law and (iii) if the  Company receives
a Takeover Proposal, the price or material  terms of a previously received
Takeover Proposal are modified or  amended or an Intervening Event occurs, in
any such case during  the five calendar day period immediately prior to the
day of the  Stockholders Meeting, the Company may delay the Stockholders 
Meeting until the date that is the fifth business day after the  date on
which the Stockholders Meeting would otherwise have been  held. The notice of
such Stockholders Meeting shall state that a  resolution to adopt this
Agreement will be considered at the  Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section
4.02(b),  (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend  to
holders of Company Common Stock that they adopt this  Agreement and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy  Statement and (y) subject to
Section 4.02(d), the  Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to solicit  the Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of
the  foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to  this
Section 5.01(c) shall not be affected by the  commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or  communication to the Company or any other person of any
Takeover  Proposal. 

  



  

  Section 5.02. __Access  to Information;  Confidentiality_._ (a) Subject
to  compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall  cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to  Parents officers,
employees, investment bankers,  attorneys, accountants, consultants and other
representatives  and advisors reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice  and during normal business hours during the period prior to the 
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their  respective
properties, assets, books, records, Contracts,  Permits, documents,
information, officers and employees, and  during such period the Company
shall, and shall cause each of  its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
any information  concerning its business as Parent may reasonably request 
(including the work papers of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  subject to the
customary requirements of PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this  Section 5.02 shall require the Company to
disclose to  Parent board or committee minutes or materials to the extent 
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or  any Takeover
Proposals. Following the date of this Agreement and  prior to the Effective
Time, Parent may (but shall not be  required to), following reasonable notice
to the Company,  contact and interview any Company Personnel and review the 
personnel records and such other information concerning the  Company
Personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No  investigation by Parent or
any of its officers, directors,  employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other  advisors or representatives and no other receipt of
information  by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, 
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or 
representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect  any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other  provision of this
Agreement, or the obligations of the parties  (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the  obligations of the parties under the
Agreement. Except as  required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will
hold,  and will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, 
attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to  hold, any
and all information received from the Company  confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the  Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by  Parent, provide Parent, to the extent applicable, with  (i) a
materially complete and correct list of all licenses  issued by the Federal
Communications Commission (the  " _FCC_ ") and held by the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries (the " _FCC Licenses_ "),  (ii) materially complete and
correct copies of each FCC  License, (iii) if available, the address and

Parent to make an independent  determination that the Company and its

that effected a change of ownership or control of the FCC  Licenses
(including any intracompany reorganizations) and  corporate

  (c) Subject to applicable law, the Company and Parent  shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,  cooperate to ensure an
orderly transition and integration  process in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize
the  disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the 
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  Section 5.03. __Reasonable  Best Efforts; Consultation and  Notice_._ (a)
Upon the terms and subject  to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the  parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to

best efforts to accomplish the  following: (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent  set forth in Article VI, (ii) the obtaining of all 
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,  orders and
authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary  notices to,

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each  of the Company and
its Board of Directors shall, if any state  takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes  applicable to this Agreement or any of
the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take
all actions  necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as  practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and  otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation  on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no 
event shall Parent or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and  its
Subsidiaries shall not without the prior written consent of  Parent, agree or
proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter  into any licensing, business
restriction or similar arrangement  with respect to, any assets (whether
tangible or intangible) or  any portion of any business of Parent, the
Company or any of  their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no 
event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to  litigate or
participate in the litigation of any suit, claim,  action or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative,  brought by any Governmental Entity (A)
challenging or  seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the
Merger  or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  (B)
seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place  any conditions on, the
ownership or operation by the Company,  Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates of all or any  portion of the business or assets or any product of
the Company  or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries or to
require  any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an 
exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any  portion of
the business or assets or any product of the Company  or its Subsidiaries or
Parent or its Subsidiaries, in each case  as a result of or in connection
with the Merger or any of the  other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;  (C) seeking to directly or indirectly impose limitations on  the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to acquire or  hold, or exercise
full rights of ownership of, any shares of  Company Common Stock or any
shares of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation or any of Parents
Subsidiaries,  including the right to vote Company Common Stock or the
shares  of common stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of  Parents
Subsidiaries on all matters properly presented to  the stockholders of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or  any of Parents Subsidiaries,
respectively; or  (D) seeking to (1) directly or indirectly prohibit  Parent
or any of its Affiliates from effectively controlling in  any respect any of
the business or operations of the Company or  its or Parents Subsidiaries or

  Section 5.05. __Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_._ (a)

or prior to the Effective Time now existing in  favor of the current or
former directors or officers of the  Company and its Subsidiaries as provided

insurance shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid  for such
six-year period; _provided_ that in no event shall  Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay, with  respect to the entire six-year period

nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with respect  to the
entire six-year period following the Effective Time, as  may be obtained for
such 300% amount. For the avoidance of  doubt, nothing in this Section
5.05(c) shall require Parent  to make expenditures for such insurance
coverage exceeding in  the aggregate the amount set forth in Section 5.05(c)
of  the Company Letter. If requested by Parent, the Company shall  issue a

heirs and his or her  representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not

Parent and the Surviving  Corporation under this Section 5.05 shall not be
terminated  or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights 
of any indemnified party to whom this Section 5.05 applies  without the prior
written consent of such affected indemnified  party.

Company  or any of its Subsidiaries enters into an Acquisition Agreement 
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (y) any Takeover  Proposal is

Agreement and that, without  these agreements, Parent would not have entered

amounts due pursuant to this Section 5.06 and, in order to  obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a  judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this  Section 5.06, the Company shall
pay to Parent its  reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees 
and expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal  relating thereto,
together with interest on the amounts set  forth in this Section 5.06 at the
prime rate of Citibank,  N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required

Agreement, and shall not issue  any such press release or make any such
public statement prior  to such reasonably practicable consultation, except
as may be  required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations

of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or  further exercise of
such rights or any other rights under this  Agreement.

  Section 8.04. __Exhibits;  Interpretation_._ The headings contained in 
this Agreement or in any Exhibit hereto and in the table of  contents to this

or interpretation of this  Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any
Exhibit but not  otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined
in  this Agreement. When a reference is made in this 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  Agreement to an Article, Section, Subsection or Exhibit, such  reference
shall be to a Section or Article of, or an Exhibit to,  this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. For all purposes  hereof, the terms "include",
"includes" and  "including" shall be deemed followed by the words  "without
limitation". The words "hereof",  "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and 
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in  this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not  to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The term  "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in  the
phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a  subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase does not mean  simply "if". For purposes of the
third and fourth  paragraphs of Section 4.02, the word "binding"  shall mean
binding and subject to acceptance by the Company  without revocation. Except
as otherwise provided, any  information "made available" to Parent by the
Company  or its Subsidiaries shall include only that information  contained

certain virtual data room maintained by the  Company through Bowne and Co.,
Inc. and that  Parents representatives have been granted access to as of 
6:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 19, 2010,  a copy of which shall
be provided to Parent as promptly as  practicable following the date of this
Agreement. The  definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the  singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any  agreement or
instrument defined or referred to herein or in any  agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such  agreement or instrument as from time
to time amended, modified  or supplemented. References to a person are also
to its  permitted successors and assigns. 

  



  

  Section 8.05. __Counterparts_._ This  Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including  by facsimile), all of which shall be considered
one and the same  agreement and shall become effective when one or more
such  counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and  delivered to
the other parties. 

  



  

  Section 8.06. __Entire  Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_._ This 
Agreement (a) together with the Exhibits hereto and the  Company Letter,
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes  all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral,  among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this  Agreement, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement,  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company enters into  a
confidentiality agreement with a person making a Takeover  Proposal in
accordance with Section 4.02(a) which does not  contain a "standstill"
provision substantially similar  to that contained in Section 7 of the
Confidentiality  Agreement, then the Company shall be deemed to have waived 
Section 7 of the Confidentiality Agreement, and  (b) except for the
provisions of Section 5.05, is not  intended to confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto  (and their respective successors and assigns) any
rights (legal,  equitable or otherwise) or remedies, whether as third party 
beneficiaries or otherwise. 

  



  

  Section 8.07. __Governing  Law_._ This Agreement shall be governed by,
and  construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, 
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under  applicable
principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. 

  



  

  Section 8.08. __Assignment_._ Neither  this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations  hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation  of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior  written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may  assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights,  interests and obligations
under this Agreement to Parent or to  any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, but no  such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its
obligations  hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement 
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective  successors and assigns. 

  



  

  Section 8.09. __Consent  to Jurisdiction; Service of Process;  Venue_._
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably  and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the  Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the
Delaware Court of  Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court
and the  Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the  State
of Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or other  proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any  other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees  that no such action, suit or
proceeding relating to this  Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its
Subsidiaries  except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees
that,  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of  any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered  mail to such
persons respective address set forth above  shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or  proceeding in the State of Delaware with
respect to any matters  to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set 

    
 ##### Table of Contents

  

   

  forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the  parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and  agrees not to plead or
claim), any objection to the laying of  venue of any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of this  Agreement or the Merger or any of the other
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of
Chancery  (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, in 
any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United  States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any  such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has  been brought in an inconvenient
forum. 

  



  

  Section 8.10. __WAIVER  OF JURY TRIAL_._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY 
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY  RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,  ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT  OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY  HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR  ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR  OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY  ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER  AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HERETO  HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY,
AMONG OTHER  THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  SECTION
8.10. 

  



  

  Section 8.11. __Enforcement_._ The  parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event  that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed  in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise 
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall  be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches  of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and  provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery  (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in  any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the
United  States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), this being  in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at  Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not  oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and  other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) any party has  an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific  performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law  or
equity. 

  



  

  Section 8.12. __Consents  and Approvals_._ For any matter under this 
Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be  valid and
binding on the parties hereto, such consent or  approval must be in writing
and executed and delivered to the  other parties by a person duly authorized
by such party to do so. 

  



  

  Section 8.13. __Severability_._ If  any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such  provision to any person or circumstance shall be
held invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent  jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability 
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any  other
provision hereof and the invalidity of a particular  provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such  provision in any other
jurisdiction.
