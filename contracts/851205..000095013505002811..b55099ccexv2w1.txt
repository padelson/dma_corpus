     holders of Company Common Stock as set forth below in Section 3.3.

               (b) All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted into the
     right to receive the Final Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in
     Section 2.2(a)(iii), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
     be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
     ("Certificate") previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter
     represent only the right to receive the Final Per Share Merger
     Consideration applicable to the shares underlying such Certificate. The
     holders of Certificates previously evidencing shares of Company Common
     Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
     have any rights with respect to the Company Common Stock except as
     otherwise provided herein or by law and, upon the surrender of Certificates
     in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1, shall only have the right
     to receive the Final Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for each of
     their shares of Company Common Stock.

     SECTION 2.3. COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND RELATED MATTERS. Each Option shall
be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal
to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject
to the Option. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation to the holder of an In-the-Money Option in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.2. The Company Stock Option Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan,
agreement, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be of no further force and effect and shall be deemed to be
deleted as of the Effective Time.

     SECTION 2.4. POST-CLOSING NET WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.

               (a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent
     shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders' Representative (as defined
     in Section 10.7) a written statement (the "Closing Statement") of Net
     Working Capital as of the close of business on the Peg Date; provided that,
     consistent with the Estimated Net Working Capital calculation described in
     Section 2.1(f), any tax provision or tax benefit recorded during the
     interim period between January 1, 2005 and the Closing Date shall be
     excluded from such calculation. The Shareholders' Representative shall have
     fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the Closing Statement (the
     "Review Period") to review the same. On or before the expiration of the
     Review Period, the Shareholders' Representative shall deliver to Parent a
     written statement accepting or objecting to the calculation of Net Working
     Capital set forth on the Closing Statement. In the event that the
     Shareholders' Representative shall object to the Closing Statement, such
     statement shall include a detailed itemization of the Shareholders'
     Representative's objections and the reasons therefor. If the Shareholders'
     Representative does not deliver such statement


                                       6
<PAGE>
     to Parent within the Review Period, the Shareholders' Representative shall
     be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement.

               (b) In the event that the Shareholders' Representative shall
     accept, or shall be deemed to have accepted, the Closing Statement as
     prepared and delivered by Parent, the Net Working Capital set forth on the
     Closing Statement shall constitute the "Final Net Working Capital." In the
     event, however, that the Shareholders' Representative shall object to the
     Closing Statement within the Review Period, Parent and the Shareholders'
     Representative shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt to resolve
     such objections. Any such objections which cannot be resolved between
     Parent and the Shareholders' Representative within thirty (30) days
     following Parent's receipt of the Shareholders' Representative's statement
     of objections shall be resolved in accordance with Section 2.4(c). The Net
     Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect
     any adjustments agreed upon by the parties, or as determined in accordance
     with Section 2.4(c), shall constitute the "Final Net Working Capital."

               (c) Should the Shareholders' Representative and Parent not be
     able to resolve such objections as may be raised with respect to the
     Closing Statement, within the thirty (30) day period described in Section
     2.4(b), either party may submit the matter to Deloitte & Touche LLP or, if
     Deloitte & Touche LLP shall not be independent of both parties at the time
     of submission of the matter, another independent nationally recognized
     accounting firm mutually agreeable to both parties (the "Arbitrator"), for
     review and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly
     as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of its engagement,
     and to make any calculations in accordance with GAAP and consistent with
     the Company's historical practice. The fees and costs of the Arbitrator, if
     one is required, shall be paid by the party who submitted the Net Working
     Capital amount which was farther away from the Final Net Working Capital
     calculated by the Arbitrator and, in the case of the Shareholders'
     Representative, shall be paid from the Initial Indemnification Escrow
     Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (as defined in
     Section 3.3).

               (d) In the event that the Final Net Working Capital is less than
     the Estimated Net Working Capital (the amount obtained by subtracting the
     Final Net Working Capital from the Estimated Net Working Capital being
     referred to herein as the "Net Working Capital Shortfall"), Parent shall be
     entitled to receive a refund of an amount equal to the Net Working Capital
     Shortfall, which amount shall be paid from the Initial Indemnification
     Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the
     event that the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Net
     Working Capital (the amount obtained by subtracting the Estimated Net
     Working Capital from the Final Net Working Capital being referred to herein
     as the "Net Working Capital Overage"), within five (5) Business Days of the
     determination of the Final Net Working Capital, Parent shall deliver to the
     Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 3.3) as a supplement to the Initial
     Indemnification Escrow Amount, an amount equal to the Net Working Capital
     Overage. In the event that the Final Net Working Capital equals the
     Estimated Net Working Capital, no amount shall be deducted from, or added
     to, the


                                       7
<PAGE>
     Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount or otherwise paid to any party with
     respect thereto.

     SECTION 2.5. POST-CLOSING DETERMINATION OF TAX REFUND AMOUNT.

               (a) The parties agree that the obligations of the Company to pay
     the Aggregate Option Consideration as set forth in Section 3.2(a) and the
     Management Severance Costs shall be deemed to have arisen on or prior to
     the Closing Date and shall be treated as deductions incurred in the
     Company's tax year ending on the Closing Date.

               (b) In the event that the actual Tax Refund Receivable as
     determined by the applicable regulatory authorities is less than the Tax
     Refund Receivable used in the calculation of the Estimated Tax Refund
     Amount (the amount obtained by subtracting the actual Tax Refund Receivable
     from the Tax Refund Receivable used in the calculation of the Estimated Tax
     Refund Amount being referred to herein as the "Tax Refund Shortfall"),
     Parent shall be entitled to receive a refund of an amount equal to ninety
     percent (90%) of the Tax Refund Shortfall, less the amount of any
     additional tax receivable that would have been booked during the interim
     period between January 1, 2005 and the Closing Date assuming knowledge of
     the Tax Refund Shortfall, which net amount, if positive, shall be paid from
     the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of
     the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the actual Tax Refund Receivable as
     determined by the applicable regulatory authorities is greater than the Tax
     Refund Receivable used in the calculation of the Estimated Tax Refund
     Amount (the amount obtained by subtracting the Tax Refund Receivable used
     in the calculation of the Estimated Tax Refund Amount from the actual Tax
     Refund Receivable being referred to herein as the "Tax Refund Overage"),
     within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Tax Refund
     Overage, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent as a supplement to the
     Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount, an amount, if positive, equal to
     ninety percent (90%) of the Tax Refund Overage, less the amount of any
     reduction in the tax receivable that would have been booked during the
     interim period between January 1, 2005 and the Closing Date assuming
     knowledge of the Tax Refund Overage. In the event that the actual Tax
     Refund Receivable as determined by the applicable regulatory authorities is
     equal to the Tax Refund Receivable used in the calculation of the Estimated
     Tax Refund Amount or the final determination of the Tax Refund Receivable
     is made by the applicable regulatory authorities following the first
     anniversary of the Closing Date, no amount shall be deducted from, or added
     to, the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount or otherwise paid to any
     party with respect thereto.

               (c) Parent shall provide to the Shareholders' Representative a
     copy of any application for the Tax Refund Receivable, or any amendments or
     supplements thereto, proposed to be filed by the Surviving Corporation
     within five (5) Business Days prior to the filing thereof and the
     opportunity to discuss with Parent the contents of such filing. Parent
     shall promptly notify the Shareholders' Representative in writing of the
     results of the audit of any such filing by an applicable regulatory
     authority. Until the earlier of the first anniversary of the Closing Date
     or final determination of the Tax Refund Receivable, Parent shall provide
     the Shareholders' Representative with


                                       8
<PAGE>
     reasonable access to the Surviving Corporation's books and records relating
     to taxes for periods prior to the Closing Date.

               (d) The parties agree that all external accounting and legal fees
     incurred by Parent and the Surviving Corporation to determine and obtain
     the Tax Refund Receivable shall not be treated as Company Expenses for any
     purpose of this Agreement, but shall be allocated ninety percent (90%) to
     the Company Equity Holders and ten percent (10%) to Parent as described in
     Section 2.1(x). To the extent that the actual expenses so incurred by
     Parent and the Surviving Corporation exceed the estimated amount of such
     expenses used in the calculation of the Estimated Tax Refund Amount, Parent
     shall be entitled to receive a refund of ninety percent (90%) of such
     excess, which amount shall be paid from the Initial Indemnification Escrow
     Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

        ARTICLE III - PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION; DISSENTING SHARES

     SECTION 3.1. PAYMENT FOR SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

               (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
     to be deposited, with a bank or trust company as shall be mutually
     acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
     benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
     through the Exchange Agent, an amount in cash (the "Exchange Fund") equal
     to (i) the Closing Per Share Payment, multiplied by (ii) the Outstanding
     Shares.

               (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, but
     in any event within five (5) Business Days (as defined in Section 10.7)
     thereof, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver or mail to each
     holder of record of Outstanding Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal in
     substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and (ii) instructions
     for use in surrendering the Certificates formerly representing such shares
     in exchange for an amount equal to the number of such shares, multiplied by
     the Final Per Share Merger Consideration.

               (c) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
     Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
     and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
     such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
     receive in exchange therefor the Final Per Share Merger Consideration
     (payable in accordance with Section 2.2), that such holder has the right to
     receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
     represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
     forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Final Per
     Share Merger Consideration (or portion thereof) payable to holders of
     Certificates.

               (d) Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.1, each
     such Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Company
     Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(ii) and
     Dissenting Shares) shall represent


                                       9
<PAGE>
     solely the right to receive the Final Per Share Merger Consideration
     relating thereto. If the Final Per Share Merger Consideration (or any
     portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person (as defined in Section
     10.7) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate formerly
     representing shares of Company Common Stock surrendered therefor is
     registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Final Per
     Share Merger Consideration that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
     properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
     Person surrendering such shares of Company Common Stock shall pay to the
     Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
     payment of the Final Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than
     the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
     the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
     not applicable.

               (e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
     Company shall be closed and, thereafter, there shall be no further
     registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock
     transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Company Common
     Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. On or
     after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of
     Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
     Agent shall be surrendered and canceled in return for the payment of the
     Final Per Share Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this
     Article III.

               (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
     upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
     Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
     Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
     reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
     against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
     Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the applicable portion of the
     Exchange Fund in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

     SECTION 3.2. PAYMENT FOR IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS.

               (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
     to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
     In-the-Money Options, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Option
     Consideration payable with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.3
     (the "Aggregate Option Consideration").

               (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, but
     in any event within five (5) Business Days thereof, Parent shall deliver or
     mail to each holder of an In-the-Money Option, (i) an optionholder
     acknowledgment letter in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
     C and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the original option
     agreements formerly representing such In-the-Money Options in exchange for
     the Option Consideration relating thereto.

               (c) Upon delivery of such acknowledgment letter, properly
     completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required
     pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such In-the-Money Option shall
     be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Option Consideration
     (payable in accordance with Section 2.3),


                                       10
<PAGE>
     and all option agreements so surrendered shall forthwith be marked
     canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Option Consideration
     (or portion thereof) payable to holders of In-the-Money Options.

               (d) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent, upon receipt of an
     optionholder acknowledgment letter, properly completed and duly executed,
     and such other documents as may be required, to remit the Option
     Consideration related to the In-the-Money Options of such holder to the
     payroll service provider of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Payment of
     the Option Consideration shall be made by the payroll service provider of
     Parent or the Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable thereafter
     (but in no event before the next regularly-scheduled payroll payment date)
     after receipt by such payroll service provider of the Option Consideration
     related to such In-the-Money Options from the Exchange Agent.

     SECTION 3.3. ESCROW ACCOUNT. At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to
HSBC Bank USA (the "Escrow Agent") an amount in cash equal to $11,000,000. The
Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit D (the "Escrow Agreement"), for purposes of (i) satisfying any claims of
the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2, (ii) paying up
to $350,000 to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for certain costs
incurred by them in obtaining non-competition obligations from any or all of the
Company employees listed on Schedule 3.3 (the "Non-Compete Escrow Amount"),
(iii) refunding to Parent any amount due under Section 2.4(d) or Section 2.5(b)
or (d), and (iv) in certain circumstances specifically set forth in this
Agreement, reimbursing the expenses of the Shareholders' Representative, all as
further described in the Escrow Agreement. The Final Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Equity
Holders") on a pro rata basis as promptly as practicable following the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

     SECTION 3.4. GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.

               (a) Promptly following the date that is one hundred twenty (120)
     days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the
     Surviving Corporation all cash, Certificates, option agreements, and other
     documents in its possession relating to the Merger, and the Exchange
     Agent's duties shall terminate; provided that Parent may re-engage the
     Exchange Agent to distribute the Final Indemnification Escrow Amount in
     accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, (i) each
     holder of a Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common
     Stock may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and
     (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)
     receive in consideration therefor (payable as provided in Section 2.2) the
     Final Per Share Merger Consideration relating thereto, and (ii) each holder
     of a cancelled In-the-Money Option may surrender the original option
     agreement related thereto to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to
     applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in
     consideration therefor (payable as provided in Section 2.3) the Option
     Consideration relating thereto.


                                       11
<PAGE>
               (b) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
     Agent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as defined in
     Section 10.7) shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
     Exchange Fund or the Aggregate Option Consideration delivered to a public
     official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
     law.

               (c) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent and the
     Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
     Final Per Share Merger Consideration or the Option Consideration to any
     holder of shares of Company Common Stock or In-the-Money Options,
     respectively, such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent
     or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with
     respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
     1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of United States federal,
     state or local tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
     Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such
     amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
     having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or
     In-the-Money Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
     made by the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent or the Surviving
     Corporation, as the case may be.

     SECTION 3.5. APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a "dissenter" as defined in
Section 14-2-1301 of the GBCC (such shares are referred to herein as "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Final Per Share
Merger Consideration but, instead, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 14-2-1301 through 14-2-1332 of the
GBCC (the "GBCC Dissenters' Rights"); provided, however, that if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall subsequently withdraw his or her demand for the payment
of the fair value of such shares or fails to establish or perfect or otherwise
loses his or her entitlement to payment of the fair value of such shares as
provided in the GBCC Dissenters' Rights, such holder shall not be entitled to
receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by the GBCC Dissenters' Rights, and each such Dissenting Share
shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished and converted, as
of the Effective Time, into and represent the right to receive from Parent, the
Final Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a)(iii).

           ARTICLE IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     In order to induce Parent and MergerCo to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company hereby makes to
Parent and MergerCo the representations and warranties contained in this Article
IV. Such representations and warranties are subject to the qualifications and
exceptions set forth in the Schedules delivered by the Company to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement. References to the knowledge or awareness of the
Company are deemed to mean the actual knowledge of the following officers and
managers


                                       12
<PAGE>
of the Company after reasonable inquiry: Robert Steinke, Emory Berry, Michael
Schreiber and Robert Settle.

     SECTION 4.1. ORGANIZATION AND CORPORATE POWER.

               (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
     and in good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia, and is duly
     qualified or registered to do business as a foreign corporation and in good
     standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties, owned,
     operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
     necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
     would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
     a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.7).

               (b) Copies of the Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the
     "Articles of Incorporation"), and the Bylaws, as amended (the "Bylaws"), of
     the Company have been furnished to Parent by the Company and are correct
     and complete as of the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of any
     term of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

     SECTION 4.2. AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENT.

               (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
     to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby and perform its obligations hereunder. Subject only to
     the approval of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock as
     described in clause (b) below, the execution, delivery and performance of
     this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
     have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of
     the Company. In connection with the foregoing, the Company Board has
     unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
     transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of
     the Company and its shareholders, (ii) adopted this Agreement in accordance
     with the provisions of the GBCC, (iii) directed that this Agreement be
     submitted to the shareholders of the Company for their approval and (iv)
     resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of
     the approval of this Agreement. The Company Board has taken such actions
     and votes as are necessary to render all applicable takeover statutes
     inapplicable to this Agreement. This Agreement, assuming due and valid
     authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and MergerCo,
     constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
     enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject only
     to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
     relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

               (b) The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
     the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is the only vote of holders
     of any shares of the capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this
     Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at a meeting of the
     Company's shareholders held for that purpose. Approval of this Agreement
     and the transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders of the Company
     without a meeting thereof requires action by the written


                                       13
<PAGE>
     consent of such shareholders having the requisite number of votes necessary
     to approve such action at a meeting of shareholders as described in the
     preceding sentence.

     SECTION 4.3. CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (a) 20,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 8,439,259.92
shares are issued and outstanding and of which 547,064.03 shares were held by
the Company in treasury, and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value per share, of which no shares are issued and outstanding. All such issued
and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. Schedule 4.3
sets forth a complete and accurate list of (i) all shareholders of the Company,
indicating the number of shares held by each shareholder, (ii) all outstanding
Options, indicating (A) the holder thereof, (B) the number of shares subject to

Merger and as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.4, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby, will: (a) violate or result in a
violation of, conflict with, constitute or result in a default (whether after
the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) under, accelerate any obligation
under, or give rise to a right of termination of, (i) any Contract (as defined
in Section 10.7) listed or required to be listed on Schedule 4.12, Schedule

accurately reflect in all material respects all corporate action taken by its
shareholders and the Company Board and any committees thereof. The copies of the
corporate records of the Company, as delivered to Parent, are true and complete
copies of the originals of such documents.

     SECTION 4.6. SUBSIDIARIES; INVESTMENTS. Schedule 4.6 sets forth the name
and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary of the
Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, and has all required corporate or other power and authority to
carry on its business as presently conducted. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified
or registered to do business as a foreign corporation and in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of its activities makes its qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All issued and outstanding shares or other equity
interests of each such Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
free and clear of all Encumbrances. There are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, commitments, preemptive rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any kind relating to the issuance or sale of, or outstanding
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, any shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company. The
Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any interest in any
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association or other
business entity, except as set forth on Schedule 4.6.

                                       15

respects as of the date thereof.

     business, and are reflected on the Base Balance Sheet in a manner
     consistent with past practice. Since the date of the Base Balance Sheet,
     the Company and its Subsidiaries have collected their accounts receivable
     in the ordinary course of their business and have not accelerated any such
     collections.

     course of business. Since the date of the Base Balance Sheet, the Company
     and its Subsidiaries have paid their accounts payable in the ordinary
     course of their business.

               (c) All of the inventory items of the Company and its

<PAGE>
     inventories stated in the Base Balance Sheet reflect the normal inventory
     valuation policies of the Company and were determined in accordance with

     inventory items have been sold or disposed of except through sales in the
     ordinary course of business. Since October 1, 2004, neither the Company nor

knowledge of the Company, any member of such officer's, director's, employee's
or shareholder's immediate family, or any Person controlled by such officer,
director, employee or shareholder or his or her immediate family. No
shareholder, director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, or to the knowledge of the Company, any of their respective

Company, or any organization which has a material Contract or arrangement with
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

     SECTION 4.12. PROPERTIES.

               (a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real
     property. Schedule 4.12 lists all real property leased or subleased to or
     by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. The Company has delivered

     amended to date) listed in said Schedule. With respect to each lease and
     sublease listed in said Schedule: (i) the lease or sublease is, and will be
     following the Closing, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
     or such Subsidiary of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, the
     other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
     only to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
     relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity; (ii) no
     such lease or sublease has been terminated in full or in part, nor has the

     such termination; (iii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
     Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party, is in breach
     or violation of, or default under, in any material respect, any such lease
     or sublease, and no event has occurred, is pending or, to the knowledge of
     the Company, is threatened, which, after the giving of notice, with lapse
     of time, or otherwise, would constitute a breach or default by the Company
     or any Subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
     other party under such lease or sublease; (iv) neither the Company nor any
     Subsidiary of the Company has assigned, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged,
     deeded in trust or encumbered any interest in the leasehold or
     subleasehold; and (v) the Company is not aware of any Encumbrance
     applicable to the real property subject to such lease, except for


                                       17
<PAGE>
     Encumbrances which do not materially impair the current uses or the
     occupancy by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the property
     subject thereto.

               (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and (if

     any Subsidiary of the Company is a party that are required to be listed on
     Schedule 4.14. The property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
     are sufficient for the conduct of their respective businesses as presently
     conducted. Except as otherwise noted thereon, all of the tangible personal
     property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are located at the
     leased real property listed on Schedule 4.12.

     payment of any accrued and unpaid Taxes of any nature of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries and, since the date of the Base Balance Sheet, neither the
     Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has incurred any Taxes other than

     copies of all annual tax returns, examination reports, and statements of

     owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any year; (iii) neither
     the IRS nor any other taxing authority is now asserting or, to the
     knowledge of the Company, threatening to assert against the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes or
     interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith; and (iv) the Company
     has never been a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a
     combined federal income Tax return nor does the Company have any liability

     any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
     arrangement. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a
     party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee
     or former employee thereof, that, individually or collectively, could give
     rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to
     Section 280G or Section 162 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
     Subsidiary of the Company is a "Foreign Person" within the meaning of
     Section 1445 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2.

     its Products which are generally available or in development, including,
     but not limited to, any libraries or code licensed under the GNU General
     Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License or similar license
     arrangement.

               (b) All licenses or other agreements under which (i) the Company
     or any Subsidiary of the Company is granted rights by others in Company
     Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) the Company has granted rights to
     others in Company Intellectual Property Rights are listed in Schedule
     4.15(b). All such licenses and other agreements constitute, and will
     constitute following the Closing, legal, valid and binding obligations of
     the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company and, to the knowledge of the
     Company, of the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their
     respective terms, subject only to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights and general
     principles of equity. No such license or agreement has been terminated in
     full or in part. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
     received notice of termination with respect to any such licenses or other
     agreements, and to the knowledge of the Company, there is no threat of such
     termination. Neither the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, nor, to
     the knowledge of the Company, any other party is in default in complying
     with any provisions of any such license or other agreement, and no
     condition or event or fact exists that, with notice or lapse of time or
     both, would constitute a default thereunder on the part of the Company or
     such Subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, on the
     part of any other party thereto. True and complete copies of all such
     licenses and other agreements have been provided to Parent.

litigation or governmental or administrative proceeding or investigation pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or affecting the properties or assets of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, nor to the knowledge of


                                       23
<PAGE>
the Company, has there occurred any event nor does there exist any condition on
the basis of which any such claim may be asserted.

     SECTION 4.17. LABOR MATTERS. The Company and its Subsidiaries generally
enjoy good employer-employee relationships with their respective employees.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is delinquent in payments to any of its
employees for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other direct

the Company or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees. No
collective bargaining agreement is in effect or is currently being negotiated by

times have been, in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
the Immigration Reform Control Act of 1986. The Company has never implemented
any plant closing or mass layoff of employees as those terms are defined in the
Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any
similar state or local law or regulation, and no layoffs that would implicate
such laws or regulations are currently contemplated.

     SECTION 4.18. PERMITS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

               (a) Schedule 4.18 sets forth a list of all franchises,
     authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, licenses, certificates,
     permits, registrations, qualifications or other rights and privileges
     (collectively "Permits") issued to or held by the Company or any Subsidiary
     of the Company. Such listed Permits are the only Permits that are necessary
     to permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses as
     they are presently conducted, except for those the absence of which would
     not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
     Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Permit is valid and in full force and
     effect. No Permit is subject to termination as a result of the execution of
     this Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

               (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
     with all applicable statutes, ordinances, orders, rules and regulations
     promulgated by any Governmental Authority which apply to the conduct of its
     business, except where the failure to comply would not reasonably be
     expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
     Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is
     subject to any judgment, consent decree, compliance order or administrative
     order with respect to its business, properties or assets.


                                       24
<PAGE>
               (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 4.18 shall not
     apply to any franchises, authorizations, approvals, orders, consents,
     licenses, certificates, permits, registrations, qualifications or other
     rights and privileges required by any Environmental Laws, as that term is
     defined in Section 4.22.

     SECTION 4.19. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

               (a) Schedule 4.19 sets forth a list of every Employee Program
     that has been maintained by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate at any time
     during the three-year period ending on the Closing Date (each Employee
     Program listed or required to be listed on Schedule 4.19 being referred to
     herein as a "Company Employee Program").

               (b) Each Company Employee Program which has been intended to
     qualify under Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a
     favorable determination or approval letter from the IRS regarding its
     qualification under such section and has, in fact, been qualified under the
     applicable section of the Code from the effective date of such Company
     Employee Program through and including the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
     the date that all of such Company Employee Program's assets were
     distributed). To the knowledge of the Company, no event or omission has
     occurred which would cause any Company Employee Program to lose its
     qualification or otherwise fail to satisfy the relevant requirements to
     provide tax-favored benefits under the applicable Code Section (including,
     without limitation, Code Sections 105, 125, 401(a) and 501(c)(9)). Each
     asset held under any such Company Employee Program may be liquidated or
     terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee, surrender charge
     or comparable liability. No partial termination (within the meaning of
     Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Company
     Employee Program.

               (c) Each Company Employee Program has been maintained and
     operated in all material respects in accordance with the laws applicable
     with respect to such Company Employee Program and all agreements related to
     such Company Employee Program. With respect to any Company Employee
     Program, there has been no (i) "prohibited transaction," as defined in
     Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
     amended ("ERISA"), or Code Section 4975, or (ii) non-deductible
     contribution, which, in the case of any of (i) or (ii), would subject the
     Company or any ERISA Affiliate to liability either directly or indirectly
     (including, without limitation, through any obligation of indemnification
     or contribution) for any damages, penalties, or taxes, or any other loss or
     expense. No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding (or
     investigation) or other proceeding (other than those relating to routine
     claims for benefits) is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
     threatened with respect to any Company Employee Program. All payments
     and/or contributions required to have been made (under the provisions of
     any agreements or other governing documents or applicable law) with respect
     to all Company Employee Programs, for all periods prior to the Closing
     Date, either have been made or have been accrued (and all such unpaid but
     accrued amounts are described on Schedule 4.19).

               (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.19, neither the Company nor
     any ERISA Affiliate (i) has ever maintained any Employee Program which has
     been subject


                                       25
<PAGE>
     to title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, including,
     but not limited to, any Multiemployer Plan or (ii) has ever provided health
     care or any other non-pension benefits to any employees after their
     employment is terminated (other than as required by part 6 of subtitle B of
     title I of ERISA) or has ever promised to provide such post-termination
     benefits.

               (e) With respect to each Company Employee Program, complete and
     correct copies of the following documents (if applicable to such Company
     Employee Program) have previously been delivered, or made available, to
     Parent: (i) all documents embodying or governing such Company Employee
     Program, and any funding medium for the Company Employee Program
     (including, without limitation, trust agreements) as they may have been
     amended to the date hereof; (ii) the most recent IRS determination or
     approval letter with respect to such Company Employee Program under Code
     Section 401(a) or 501(c)(9), and any applications for determination or
     approval subsequently filed with the IRS; (iii) the three most recently
     filed IRS Forms 5500, with all applicable schedules and accountants'
     opinions attached thereto; (iv) the three most recent actuarial valuation
     reports completed with respect to such Company Employee Program; (v) the
     summary plan description for such Company Employee Program (or other
     descriptions of such Company Employee Program provided to employees) and
     all modifications thereto; (vi) any insurance policy (including any
     fiduciary liability insurance policy or fidelity bond) related to such
     Company Employee Program; (vii) any registration statement or other filing
     made pursuant to any federal or state securities law; and (viii) all
     correspondence to and from any state or federal agency within the last
     three years with respect to such Company Employee Program.

               (f) Each Company Employee Program may be amended, terminated, or
     otherwise modified by the Company to the greatest extent permitted by
     applicable law, including the elimination of any and all future benefit
     accruals under any Company Employee Program, and no employee communications
     have restricted the rights of the Company or the ERISA Affiliate to so
     amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Company Employee Program.

               (g) Each Company Employee Program has been maintained in
     compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
     federal and state securities laws including, without limitation, the
     requirements that the offering of interests in such Employee Program be
     registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or state "Blue
     Sky" laws.

               (h) Each Company Employee Program has complied in all material
     respects with the applicable notification and other applicable requirements
     of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Health
     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Newborns' and
     Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, the Mental Health Parity Act of
     1996, and the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998.

               (i) The Company has terminated its 401(k) plan and fully vested
     all participants in such plan. The Company has accrued for the payment of
     all amounts


                                       26
<PAGE>
     payable under the incentive, bonus and retention plans and arrangements of
     the Company and its Subsidiaries (a true and complete list of which is set
     forth on Schedule 4.19), and all such plans and arrangements shall
     terminate as of the Effective Time. Schedule 4.19 sets forth a complete and
     accurate listing of all of the Management Severance Costs, and such
     Management Severance Costs represent all amounts payable by the Company or
     the Surviving Corporation to discharge in full its obligations under the
     Management Employment Agreements.

               (j) For purposes of this section:

                    (i) "Employee Program" means (A) all employee benefit plans
     within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(3), including, but not limited to,
     multiple employer welfare arrangements (within the meaning of ERISA Section
     3(40)), plans to which more than one unaffiliated employer contributes and
     employee benefit plans (such as foreign or excess benefit plans) which are
     not subject to ERISA; (B) all stock option plans, stock purchase plans,
     bonus or incentive award plans, severance pay policies or agreements,
     deferred compensation agreements, supplemental income arrangements,
     vacation plans, and all other employee benefit plans, agreements, and
     arrangements (including any informal arrangements) not described in (A)
     above, including, without limitation, any arrangement intended to comply
     with Code Section 120, 125, 127, 129 or 137; and (C) all plans or
     arrangements providing compensation to employee and non-employee directors.
     In the case of an Employee Program funded through a trust described in Code
     Section 401(a) or an organization described in Code Section 501(c)(9), or
     any other funding vehicle, each reference to such Employee Program shall
     include a reference to such trust, organization or other vehicle.

                    (ii) An entity "maintains" an Employee Program if such
     entity sponsors, contributes to, or provides benefits under or through such
     Employee Program, or has any obligation (by agreement or under applicable
     law) to contribute to or provide benefits under or through such Employee
     Program, or if such Employee Program provides benefits to or otherwise
     covers employees of such entity (or their spouses, dependents or
     beneficiaries).

                    (iii) An entity is an "ERISA Affiliate" of the Company if it
     would have ever been considered a single employer with the Company under
     ERISA Section 4001(b) or part of the same "controlled group" as the Company
     for purposes of ERISA Section 302(d)(8)(C).

                    (iv) "Multiemployer Plan" means an employee pension or
     welfare benefit plan to which more than one unaffiliated employer
     contributes and which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective
     bargaining agreements.

     SECTION 4.20. INSURANCE COVERAGE. Schedule 4.20 contains a list of the
insurance policies currently maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
There are currently no claims pending against the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company under any insurance policies currently in effect and covering the

and all premiums due and payable with respect to the policies


                                       27
<PAGE>
maintained by the Company have been paid to date. To the Company's knowledge,

commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions

Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley") as its financial advisor, the
arrangements with which have been accurately and completely disclosed to Parent.
The parties agree that all fees and expenses payable by the Company to Morgan

consideration to be received by the Company Equity Holders hereunder is fair to
such Company Equity Holders from a financial point of view.

     SECTION 4.22. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except in material compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws (as defined below), neither the Company or any

no Hazardous Material is present in, on, or under any such property. The Company
and each Subsidiary of the Company is, and at all times has been, in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable environmental, health and safety
laws, rules, ordinances, by-laws and regulations, and with all permits,
registrations and approvals required under such laws, rules, ordinances, by-laws
and regulations (collectively, "Environmental Laws"). The Company is not aware
of any fact or circumstance which could involve the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company in any litigation, or impose upon the Company or any such Subsidiary
any liability, arising under any Environmental Laws.

<PAGE>
otherwise materially and adversely modify its relationship with the Company or

foregoing clauses (a), (c) and (d), such violations, conflicts, defaults,
notices, declarations, filings, consents and approvals which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, (i) a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (ii) a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or MergerCo to
perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     SECTION 5.4. REQUIRED FINANCING. Parent and MergerCo have sufficient funds
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.5. INVESTMENT BANKING; BROKERAGE. Neither Parent nor MergerCo has
any liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder

solely responsible for the fees and expenses of Wachovia Securities.

     SECTION 5.6. LITIGATION. There is no litigation or governmental or
administrative proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or MergerCo that, in either case, would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (a) prevent or

materially delay the performance by Parent or MergerCo of any of their material
obligations under this Agreement.

                       ARTICLE VI - ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     SECTION 6.1. SHAREHOLDER CONSENT. The Company, acting through the Company
Board, immediately following the execution of this Agreement by the Company,
shall request, in accordance with applicable law, that the Company's
shareholders approve this Agreement by written consent (the "Written Consent"),
and take all actions reasonably necessary to approve the performance of the
Company's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the Merger. Such
request for the Written Consent shall comply with the applicable requirements of
the GBCC, the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws, including, without
limitation, any disclosure requirements.

     SECTION 6.2. CONFIDENTIALITY. The parties shall adhere to the terms and
conditions of that certain confidentiality agreement dated November 29, 2004 by
and between the Company and Parent, as amended effective December 14, 2004 and
March 21, 2005 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

     SECTION 6.3. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.

               (a) After the Effective Time and until the conclusion of a
     transition period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion,
     employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries who remain
     employed after the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") will continue
     to participate in the Company's Employee Programs (other than 401(k) plans,
     deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement plans, incentive or
     bonus plans, severances plans, and stock option and stock purchase


                                       31
<PAGE>
     plans) on substantially similar terms to those in effect as of the
     Effective Time. Thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
     Corporation to, provide the Company Employees with such employee benefits
     as determined appropriate from time to time by Parent in its sole
     discretion. All service with the Company shall be considered service with
     Parent for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not with
     respect to benefit accruals) under all Employee Programs maintained by
     Parent or any Affiliate, including the Surviving Corporation, with respect
     to Company Employees. All earnings with the Company prior to the Effective
     Time will be taken into account for purposes of any welfare benefit plan or
     under any vacation pay, sick pay or paid-time-off policy in which the
     Company Employees may participate. For purposes of participation in
     Parent's welfare plans, Parent will waive all waiting and pre-existing
     condition period requirements (other than those applicable to a Company
     Employee immediately prior to the Closing under a Company Employee Program)
     and will credit Company Employees with all deductibles and co-payments paid
     under the Company welfare plans for the plan year in which the Company
     Employees begin participation in Parent's welfare plans.

               (b) Subject to plan eligibility rules, the Company Employees will
     be eligible to participate in Parent's 401(k) plan in the same manner as
     similarly-situated employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
     effective as of the first full payroll period following the Effective Time.
     Company Employees shall be offered an opportunity to roll over their
     Company 401(k) account balance distributions into Parent's 401(k) plan,
     subject to the rules of such plan. Parent shall make reasonable efforts to
     amend such defined contribution plan to accept rollovers of unpaid loan
     balances, if necessary.

     SECTION 6.4. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold
     harmless the present and former directors and officers of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries against all liabilities arising out of actions or
     omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, solely
     with respect to third-party claims, the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement) to the extent such persons are entitled to indemnification under
     the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws, each as in effect on the date
     hereof, including provisions relating to the advancement of expenses
     incurred in the defense of any litigation.

               (b) The Company shall secure, at Parent's expense, "tail" or
     "run-off" coverage under its existing directors' and officers' liability
     insurance policy, containing comparable coverage to that currently
     provided, prior to the Effective Time covering persons who are currently
     covered by such insurance against "wrongful acts" as defined by such
     insurance policy, committed prior to the Effective Time. Such "tail" or
     "run-off" coverage shall cover a period of six (6) years after the Closing
     Date; provided that the aggregate cost of such coverage shall not exceed
     $60,750.

     SECTION 6.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. After the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of


                                       32
<PAGE>
the Company, any assignments, instruments or other documents and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions and things to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of all assets,
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of both the Company and
MergerCo.

     SECTION 8.2. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY EQUITY HOLDERS.

               (a) The Company Equity Holders, subject to the other terms and
     conditions of this Agreement, shall indemnify Parent, the Surviving
     Corporation and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors and
     employees (each a "Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party") against and hold
     them harmless to the extent of any Losses (as defined in Section 10.7)
     resulting from:

                    (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the
     Company contained herein, in any Company Schedule or in any certificate
     delivered in connection herewith;

                    (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company
     contained herein;

                    (iii) Taxes of the Company in respect of any period ending,
     or any transaction or business occurring, on or before the close of
     business on the Closing Date which have not been properly accrued for on
     the Base Balance Sheet;

                    (iv) any obligations for severance or termination payments
     or benefits paid by the Surviving Corporation to directors, officers or
     employees at or after the Effective Time pursuant to Contracts between the
     Company and any such directors, officers or employees in effect immediately
     prior to the Effective Time;

                    (v) any Company Expenses not included in the calculation of
     the Initial Merger Consideration as of the Effective Time;

                    (vi) the excess, if any, over the Final Per Share Merger
     Consideration of any amounts paid per share (including in such amount, all
     reasonable out-of-pocket costs of Parent and the Surviving Corporation) as
     a result of the exercise and perfection of appraisal rights in accordance
     with the GBCC Dissenters' Rights by the holders of more than five percent
     (5%) of the shares of the Company's capital stock;

                    (vii) any adverse change in the Net Working Capital of the
     Company from the close of business on the Peg Date to the close of business
     on the Closing Date which occurred as a result of the Company or any
     Subsidiary of the Company taking any of the actions described in Section
     4.9, or any other action or event outside of the ordinary course of
     business consistent with the Company's past practice; and

                    (viii) the items listed on Schedule 8.2(a) and Schedule
     8.2(b).

               (b) The indemnification obligations of the Company Equity Holders
     pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall be limited as follows:

                    (i) The Company Equity Holders shall have no obligation to
     provide any indemnification for any individual claim for Losses of less
     than $10,000 (the


                                       35
<PAGE>
     "Deductible"), nor until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that
     individually equal or exceed the Deductible and would otherwise be
     indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 8.2 exceeds $500,000 (the "Threshold
     Amount"), whereupon the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties shall be
     entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof (on a
     dollar-for-dollar basis commencing from the first dollar) for all Losses up
     to the Maximum Amount (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
     the limitations listed in this Section 8.2(b)(i) shall be subject to
     Schedule 8.2(b) and shall not apply to (A) Losses resulting from a breach
     of any of the Excluded Representations and Warranties or a breach of the
     representation set forth in Section 4.9(f), (B) any claims under Section
     8.2(a)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) or paragraph 1 or 2 of Schedule
     8.2(a), and (C) any Losses resulting from fraud, intentional
     misrepresentation or willful breach by the Company.

                    (ii) The Company Equity Holders shall not be obligated to
     indemnify any Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
     for any amount of indemnifiable Losses in excess of $11,000,000 in the
     aggregate (the "Maximum Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
     Section 8.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to (A) Losses resulting from a breach of
     any of the Excluded Representations and Warranties or a breach of the
     representation set forth in Section 4.9(f), (B) any claims under Section
     8.2(a)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) or paragraph 1 or 2 of Schedule
     8.2(a), and (C) any Losses resulting from fraud, intentional
     misrepresentation or willful breach by the Company; provided that, except
     for Losses described in clause (C) above, the aggregate amount of
     indemnifiable Losses payable by the Company Equity Holders under Section
     8.2(a) shall not exceed the product of (i) the Final Per Share Merger
     Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the Outstanding Shares.

                    (iii) In no event shall any Company Equity Holder be
     obligated to indemnify a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party for any Losses
     pursuant to this Article VIII in excess of such Company Equity Holder's pro
     rata portion of such Loss based on such Company Equity Holder's percentage
     ownership of the Outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective
     Time.

                    (iv) No indemnification shall be payable to a
     Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party with respect to claims asserted by such
     Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a) after the
     first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Cut-Off
     Date") (it being understood that all claims asserted prior to the
     Indemnification Cut-Off Date shall continue until the disposition of such
     claim). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.2(b)(iv) shall not
     apply to claims by a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party (A) of a breach of
     any of the Excluded Representations and Warranties, which shall survive
     until the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect thereto,
     (B) under Section 8.2(a)(iii) or (vi) or paragraph 1 or 2 of Schedule
     8.2(a), or (C) of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by
     the Company.

               (c) A Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall give the
     Shareholders' Representative written notice of any claim or proceeding by
     or in respect of a third party as to which such Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
     Party may request indemnification


                                       36
<PAGE>
     hereunder as soon as is practicable after such Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
     Party learns of such claim or proceeding; provided, however, that the
     failure to so notify the Shareholders' Representative shall not affect
     rights to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Company
     Equity Holders are materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall
     specify in reasonable detail the amount of the claim and the basis for the
     claim, and shall include appropriate documentation evidencing such claim.
     Parent shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own choosing
     (with the consent of the Shareholders' Representative, which consent shall
     not be unreasonably withheld), the defense or settlement of any third-party
     claim or proceeding at the expense of the Company Equity Holders, subject
     to Section 8.2(d) below. If Parent elects to assume the defense of any such
     third-party claim or proceeding, Parent shall consult with the
     Shareholders' Representative for the purpose of allowing the Shareholders'
     Representative to participate in such defense, and in such case the
     expenses of the Shareholders' Representative shall be paid by the Company
     Equity Holders. The Shareholders' Representative shall cooperate with
     Parent in the defense or settlement of any third-party claim. If Parent
     elects to direct the defense of any such third-party claim or proceeding,
     the Shareholders' Representative shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any
     part of such third-party claim unless Parent consents in writing to such
     payment. If Parent fails to defend or if, after commencing or undertaking
     any such defense, Parent fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense,
     the Shareholders' Representative shall have the right to undertake the
     defense or settlement thereof, at the Company Equity Holders' expense,
     which reasonable expenses the Shareholders' Representative may recover from
     the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of
     the Escrow Agreement. If the Shareholders' Representative assumes the
     defense of any such third-party claim or proceeding pursuant to this
     Section 8.2(c) and proposes to settle such third-party claim or proceeding
     prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with respect
     thereto and such settlement or judgment shall not be paid in full by the
     Company Equity Holders in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII,
     then the Shareholders' Representative shall give Parent prompt written
     notice thereof, and Parent shall have the right to participate in the
     settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such third-party claim or
     proceeding. The Company Equity Holders shall not be liable for any
     settlement of any third-party claim or proceeding effected without the
     Shareholders' Representative's prior written consent, which consent shall
     not be unreasonably withheld.

               (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
     and in addition to any indemnification claims against the Company Equity
     Holders pursuant to this Section 8.2, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
     shall be entitled to recover from the Initial Indemnification Escrow
     Amount, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and on a
     dollar-for-dollar basis, (i) the Non-Compete Escrow Amount and (ii) any
     amount due to Parent under Section 2.4(d) or Section 2.5(b) or (d). All
     indemnification claims made by a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party pursuant
     to this Section 8.2 shall be made first against the Initial Indemnification
     Escrow Amount, and only after the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount is
     exhausted, and/or is the subject of potential or pending claims under
     clause (i) of the preceding sentence, and/or pending claims under clause
     (ii) of the preceding sentence, may a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified


                                       37
<PAGE>
     Party seek recourse against any Company Equity Holder for indemnification
     hereunder, if permitted. It being agreed that, if a Parent/MergerCo
     Indemnified Party has made an indemnification claim against the Initial
     Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms hereof, but the
     Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount is exhausted or otherwise subject to
     claims described in the preceding sentence prior to the resolution of such
     indemnification claim, the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall be
     entitled at that time to seek recourse directly against the Company Equity
     Holders for indemnification hereunder, if permitted.

               (e) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Surviving
     Corporation, as successor to the Company, have any obligation to indemnify
     for, contribute to or otherwise share in the obligation to indemnify any
     Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party under this Section 8.2.

     SECTION 8.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT.

               (a) Parent, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
     Agreement, shall indemnify the Company Equity Holders (each a "Company
     Indemnified Party") against and hold them harmless from all Losses
     resulting from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of Parent
     or MergerCo contained herein or in any certificate delivered in connection
     herewith, and (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or
     MergerCo contained herein.

               (b) The indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section
     8.3(a) shall not be effective for any individual claim for Losses of less
     than the Deductible, nor until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses
     that individually equal or exceed the Deductible and would otherwise be
     indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 8.3 exceeds the Threshold Amount,
     whereupon the Company Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
     indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof (on a dollar-for-dollar basis
     commencing from the first dollar) for all Losses up to the Maximum Amount.
     No indemnification shall be payable to a Company Indemnified Party with
     respect to claims asserted by such Company Indemnified Party pursuant to
     Section 8.3(a) after the Indemnification Cut-Off Date. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, this Section 8.3(b) shall not apply to Losses resulting from (A)
     a breach of any of the representations and warranties of Parent and
     MergerCo set forth in Section 5.2 or 5.5, (B) any failure by Parent to make
     the payments to the Company Equity Holders and the holders of In-the-Money
     Options described under Articles II and III, and (C) a breach of any of the
     covenants of Parent contained in Section 6.4.

               (c) A Company Indemnified Party shall give Parent written notice
     of any claim or proceeding by or in respect of a third party as to which
     such Company Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder as
     soon as is practicable after such Company Indemnified Party learns of such
     claim or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify
     Parent shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the
     extent that Parent is materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice
     shall specify in reasonable detail the amount of the claim and the basis
     for the claim, and shall include appropriate documentation evidencing such
     claim. Parent shall have the right to


                                       38
<PAGE>
     direct, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of
     any third-party claim or proceeding at its own expense. If Parent elects to
     assume the defense of any such third-party claim or proceeding, Parent
     shall consult with the Company Indemnified Party and the Company
     Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but in such case the
     expenses of the Company Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Company
     Indemnified Party. The Company Indemnified Party shall provide Parent with
     access to its records and personnel relating to any such third-party claim,
     assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall
     otherwise cooperate with Parent in the defense or settlement thereof, and
     Parent shall reimburse the Company Indemnified Party for all reasonable
     out-of-pocket expenses of such Company Indemnified Party in connection
     therewith. If Parent elects to direct the defense of any third-party claim
     or proceeding, the Company Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be
     paid, any part of such third-party claim, unless Parent consents in writing
     to such payment, or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be
     taken by or on behalf of Parent is entered against the Company Indemnified
     Party for such liability. If Parent fails to defend or if, after commencing
     or undertaking any such defense, Parent fails to prosecute or withdraws
     from such defense, the Company Indemnified Party shall have the right to
     undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at Parent's expense. If the
     Company Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such third-party claim
     or proceeding pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) and proposes to settle such
     third-party claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to
     forego appeal with respect thereto, then such Company Indemnified Party
     shall give Parent prompt written notice thereof and Parent shall have the
     right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of
     such third-party claim or proceeding. Parent shall not be liable for any
     settlement of any third-party claim or proceeding effected without its
     prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     SECTION 8.4. TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. All payments made by the
Company Equity Holders or Parent, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of
the other parties pursuant to this Article VIII shall be treated as adjustments
to the Final Per Share Merger Consideration for tax purposes, and such agreed
treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.5. REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE. From and after the Closing, the rights of
the parties and their respective Affiliates, equity holders, officers, directors
and employees to indemnification relating to this Agreement shall be limited to
those contained in this Article VIII, and such indemnification rights shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of such parties subsequent to the Closing Date
with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall
have, in addition to the remedies set forth in this Article VIII, such equitable
remedies to which such parties may be otherwise entitled, including, without
limitation, the ability to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunctive relief.

                 ARTICLE IX - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     SECTION 9.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after shareholder approval
hereof:

               (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, MergerCo and the
     Company;

               (b) by Parent or MergerCo, if the Company does not deliver, by
     the close of business on the date hereof, signature pages to the Written
     Consent of shareholders representing at least eighty-four percent (84%) of
     the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock; or

               (c) by either of the Company, or Parent or MergerCo, if the
     consummation of the Merger shall not have occurred on or before the close
     of business on the date hereof for any other reason.

     SECTION 9.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Parent,
MergerCo or the Company and their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members or shareholders and all rights and obligations of
any party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements contained in Section
6.2, this Section 9.2 and Article X; provided, however, that nothing contained
in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages arising
out of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by such party
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.3. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at
any time before or after any approval hereof by the shareholders of the Company
and MergerCo; provided, however, that after any such shareholder approval, no
amendment shall become effective that by law requires further approval by
shareholders without obtaining such approval.

     SECTION 9.4. EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and
(c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be
enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by a party shall not
be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver of the same term or
condition by such party, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement by such party.

     SECTION 10.2. HEADINGS. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.3. INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article
or Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms used herein with
initial capital letters have the meanings ascribed to them herein and all terms
defined in this Agreement will have such defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein, or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein, means such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

     SECTION 10.4. ASSIGNMENT. Except as expressly permitted by the terms
hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties.

     SECTION 10.5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Agreement, and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of
this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any
provision is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto give to the court, or
its designee, the right to replace such provision by a provision that is valid
and enforceable and which comes as close as possible to effecting the meaning of
the original provision.

     SECTION 10.6. NO AGREEMENT UNTIL EXECUTED. Irrespective of negotiations
among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement
or understanding among the parties hereto unless and until (a) the Company Board
and the Board of Directors of MergerCo have approved, for purposes of the GBCC
and any applicable provision of their Articles of Incorporation, the terms of
this Agreement and (b) this Agreement is executed by the parties hereto.

making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders'
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including, without

dispute regarding indemnification claims or matters arising out of this
Agreement and (ii) take all actions necessary in the judgment of the
Shareholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Notices to
or from the Shareholders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each
Company Equity Holder. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders' Representative in connection with any of the foregoing matters
shall constitute a decision of all of the Company Equity Holders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Company Equity Holders, and
Parent and

<PAGE>
the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such written decision, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Representative as being the decision, consent
or instruction of each and every Company Equity Holder. The Escrow Agent, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for the acts done by them in accordance with such decision, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Representative. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Shareholders' Representative will not be liable
to any Company Equity Holder in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on
the part of the Shareholders' Representative, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of the
Shareholders' Representative's good faith. If the Shareholders' Representative
shall resign or become unable to fulfill its duties as such, then the
Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to appoint its replacement and
shall promptly notify the Escrow Agent and Parent of such appointment.

     SECTION 10.9. FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, each of Parent (on behalf
of Parent and MergerCo), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall bear its own expenses in connection with the negotiation and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The expenses of
the Shareholders' Representative acting on behalf of the Company Equity Holders
hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne on a pro rata basis by
the Company Equity Holders. Such expenses of the Shareholders' Representative
may be paid from the Final Indemnification Escrow Amount prior to any
distribution thereof to the Company Equity Holders in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

     SECTION 10.10. CHOICE OF LAW. All disputes, claims or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement (including any schedules to this
Agreement), or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to
its rules of conflict of laws (except as to matters related to the procedures
for the Merger, in which case the laws of the State of Georgia shall apply). The
parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of any court of the State of Delaware
or the United States District Court for the State of Delaware for the purpose of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement, or any of
the agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, which is brought by or
against such party and (a) hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect
to any such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
court; (b) to the extent that such party has acquired, or hereafter may acquire,
any immunity from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
therein, hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such immunity;
and (c) hereby agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating to
this Agreement except in such court. Such parties hereby waive, and agree not to
assert in any such suit, action or proceeding, as the case may be, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim that (i) such party is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court; (ii) such party is
immune from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with
respect to it or its property; or (iii) any suit, action or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of such parties further agrees that
service of any process, summons or notice by U.S. registered mail to its address
set forth herein or otherwise provided in writing to the other party hereto
shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought
against it in such court.


                                       45

     SECTION 10.11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in courts of competent
jurisdiction. Such remedies shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to
any other remedies that any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

     SECTION 10.12. MUTUAL DRAFTING. The parties hereto are sophisticated and
have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated
hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence,
the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should
be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

     SECTION 10.13. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement (a) constitutes, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto,
the entire agreement and supersedes all of the prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and
is not intended to confer upon any other Person (except as set forth in Article
VIII) any rights or remedies hereunder and (c) may be executed in two or more
counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement.
