8.7.3 In the event of existence of any Third Partys Claim brought against

8.7.6 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the Defense of

Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party exercises the option to assume
the Defense by means of delivery of notice in writing to the Indemnifiable
Party, as set forth in Section 9.1 below, (a) prior to the lapse of 3/4
(three quarters) of the legal period for submission of the Defense, or (b)
02 (two) Business Days counted from the delivery of the Claim Notice; between
(a) and (b), whichever the largest term. The failure to deliver notice in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, containing the warranty and any other
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.7.6, shall be deemed as a
declaration of waiver of the right to assume the Defense, subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 8.7.9.

  



  

8.7.7 In the event the Defense is assumed by the Indemnifying Party:

  



  

(a) the Indemnifiable Party shall only execute agreements or pay any value
relating to any such Third Partys Claim upon previous consent, in writing,
of the Indemnifying Party;

or material requested by the Indemnifying Party necessary for purposes of
instruction of the Defense; and

Third Partys Claim and the respective Defense, and the Indemnifiable Party
may appoint attorneys-in-fact to monitor the activities to be conducted by
the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifiable Party
shall bear any and all costs incurred in connection with any such
appointment.

  



  

8.7.8 In the event the Indemnifying Party does not wish to, or waives
the right to, assume the Defense, then the Indemnifiable Party may, on
own discretion, pay the obligation, which is contemplated in the Third
Partys Claim, or assume the Defense

thereof, in any events at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject to
the provisions set forth in Sections 8.7.9 and 8.7.10.

  



  

8.7.9 Regardless of the party which will conduct the Defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall bear any and all costs and expenses related to the
Defense of any Third Partys Claim which may give rise to any Loss incumbent
upon the Indemnifying Party, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys, accountants and experts fees and expenses, administrative
and/or judicial charges and judicial and administrative deposits required or
necessary in order to permit the presentation and adequate conduction of the
Defense.

  



  

8.7.10 If the Loss relates to any periods, events or omissions both prior
and subsequent to the Closing Date, (i) the corresponding costs and
expenses shall be equably borne by Parties, based on the percentage of the
respective liabilities with respect to the value of the Loss to be incurred;
and (ii) the Party which holds the greater percentage of liability with
respect to the obligation claimed shall be entitled to assume the respective
defense.

  



  

8.8 _Indemnification even after the Approval of Accounts and Financial
Statements_. Without prejudice to the obligation to substitute the officers
and directors undertaken by the Buyer in Section 4.6 above, although the
Buyer may come to approve, or cause to be approved, the Companys and
the Subsidiaries accounts and financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009 in the respective annual general meetings or annual
shareholders meetings, as the case may be, any such approval shall not mean
the waiver, by the Buyer, of the right to require from the Sellers the
indemnification set forth in this Section 8, and the Sellers, Bunge Ltd. and
the substituted officers and directors shall remain liable as set forth in
the applicable legislation and in this Agreement.

(A) Each of the Sellers, by itself or by means of any of its respective
Affiliates, undertakes not to produce rock from phosphate, sulfuric acid,
phosphoric acid, dicalcium phosphate fertilizers, phosphates low
concentration (Single Superphosphate), or in high concentration (Triple
Superphosphate - TSP, Monoammonium Phosphate - MAP and Diammonium Phosphate-

mineral fertilizers, i.e., resulting of the physical mix of grains; and (b)

competition practice), with respect to the geographic location and products
under the Supply Agreement, higher than twenty percent (20%) of such
historical market share, in one or more continued periods of ninety (90)
days. The suspension of the non-compete obligation, in this case, shall
be limited to commercialization of the volume of products in the market(s)
under the effects of the anti-competition practices, equivalent to the
difference between the aforementioned historical market share of the Company
(including BFE´s market share before this date, if necessary) and its real
market share during the period. If there is no agreement between the Parties

of the market shares, which cause the adverse effects set forth hereto, the
matter will be decided by means of arbitration pursuant to Section 9.12.

  



  

9.8.1 The non-competition obligation set forth in Section 9.8 above shall be

restrictions.

  



  

9.8.3 If any Party or the respective Affiliates fails to perform the non-
competition obligation set forth in Section 9.8 above, and fails to resolve
the nonperformance within a period of 10 (ten) days counted from the date of
receipt of notice from the non-defaulting party informing about the default,
such non-defaulting party may require the defaulting party to pay a
compensatory fine of US$100,000,000 (one hundred million United-States
dollars), to be paid within a period of 5 (five) Business Days counted from
the end of the aforesaid period of 10 (ten) days, which shall be the total
compensation to be paid for the losses and damages incurred by virtue of the
default. In the event of delinquency in the payment of the fine within the
period set forth in this Section 9.8.3, the value payable shall be restated
based on the variation of IGP-M/FGV and increased by interest of 1% (one
percent) per month, calculated on pro rate basis, counted from the maturity

in the value resulting from the sum of the compensation and benefits received
by the respective Relevant Employee during the period of 24 months counted
from the date of termination of employment or contractual relationship with
the Company and/or the Subsidiaries, to be paid within a period of 10 (ten)
days counted from the delivery of notice by the Buyer to the Sellers
informing about the default, which fine shall represent the entire
compensation for the losses and damages incurred by the non-defaulting Party,
without prejudice to the specific performance of the obligation herein.

of the default, in case any commercial secret and/or confidential information
related to the Company and the Subsidiaries, with respect to their
businesses, clients, suppliers, relationship with third-parties, financial
