### (d) All of the shares of Investors Financial Common Stock converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_

Ratio and (2) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth of a US
dollar, of the closing sale prices of State Street Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal
for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective
Time (the " _State Street Closing Price_ ") over (B) the exercise price per
share of Investors Financial Common Stock subject to such Investors Financial
Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Investors Financial Common
Stock subject to such Investors Financial Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that all amounts payable pursuant to this Section
1.5(a) shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, without interest, and State Street shall be entitled to

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, on the same
terms as other shareholders as set forth in Article II but subject to the
vesting schedule described in the next sentence; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, State Street shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable
state or local Tax law.  The shares of State Street Common Stock payable to
each holder of Investors Financial Restricted Shares pursuant to this Section
1.5(b) (" _Adjusted Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest on the same dates and in
the same proportions as the corresponding Investors Financial Restricted
Shares would have vested under the vesting schedule in effect immediately
prior to the date hereof, provided that each holders Adjusted Restricted
Shares shall instead vest in three equal annual installments on

        

### each of the first three anniversaries of the applicable date of grant to
the extent such vesting schedule would result in the earlier vesting of
such Adjusted Restricted Shares; and provided, further, that each holders
Adjusted Restricted Shares shall immediately vest in full upon a termination
of such holders employment by State Street without Cause or upon such
holders resignation for Good Reason.

  

" _Cause_ " means, with respect to any person, the occurrence of any one of
the following:

  

(i) such person is convicted of, or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, (A)

misconduct that have a materially detrimental effect on State Street or a
State Street Subsidiary;

  

(iii) such person continually and willfuly fails, for at least 14 days

persons employment duties (other than as a result of incapacity due to
physical or mental illness); or

  

(iv) such person commits a violation of any of State Streets material
policies that is materially detrimental to the best interests of State

(ii) such persons principle location of employment is relocated by more than
35 miles.

  

(c) With respect to the Investors Financial 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " _ESPP_ "), (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions
from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no Payment Periods
(as defined in the ESPP) shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement,
(iii) the Payment Period that is in effect on the date of this Agreement (the
" _Current Payment Period_ ") shall continue in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP, and the shares of Investors Financial Common Stock purchased by
participants on the last day of the Current Payment Period (the " _Payment
Period Last Day_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(c) ( _provided_ that State
Street may direct Investors Financial to pay to each participant in the ESPP,
on the Payment Period Last Day, in lieu of the shares of Investors Financial
Common Stock otherwise purchasable by such participant on the Payment Period
Last Day, a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of
(1) the fair market value (as determined pursuant to the ESPP) per share of
Investors Financial Common Stock on the Payment Period Last Day over (2) the
Option Price (as defined in the ESPP) for the Current Payment Period (the "
_Current Payment Period Option Price_ ") and (B) the number of whole shares
of Investors Financial Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
participants option for the Current Payment Period at the Current Payment
Period Option Price with such participants accumulated payroll deductions
for the

        

Current Payment Period) and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate immediately
following the Payment Period Last Day; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Closing occurs prior to the Payment Period Last Day, each
participants option then outstanding under the ESPP shall, effective at the
Effective Time, be, at State Streets discretion, either (I) automatically
exercised by applying the payroll deductions of such participant accumulated
as of the Effective Time for the Current Payment Period to the purchase of a
number of whole shares of Investors Financial Common Stock at the Current
Payment Period Option Price (determined assuming the Closing Date were the
Payment Period Last Day), which number of shares shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 1.4(c) or (II) canceled in exchange for a cash payment equal to
the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (1) the product of the Exchange
Ratio and the State Street Closing Price over (2) the Current Payment Period
Option Price (determined assuming the Closing Date were the Payment Period
Last Day) and (y) the number of whole shares of Investors Financial Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to such participants option for the Current
Payment Period at the Current Payment Period Option Price (determined
assuming the Closing Date were the Payment Period Last Day) with such
participants payroll deductions accumulated for the Current Payment Period
as of the Effective Time. The ESPP shall terminate immediately following the
earlier of the Payment Period Last Day or the Closing Date (the " _ESPP
Termination Date_ "). All determinations of the number of shares
of Investors Financial Common Stock purchasable pursuant to this Section
1.5(c) shall be subject to the ESPPs limitations on maximum numbers of
shares purchasable and fractional shares. Any excess payroll deductions not
used to purchase shares or determine payment amounts pursuant to this Section
1.5(c) as a result of ESPP share limitations or fractional share limitations
shall be distributed to the applicable participant immediately following the

### (d) Investors Financial and State Street agree that prior to the
Effective Time, Investors Financial shall take all actions reasonably
necessary, if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 1.5 and to preclude any automatic
or formulaic grant of options, restricted shares or other awards on or after
the date hereof.

the State Street Articles shall be the articles of organization of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law.

  

## 1.7 _Bylaws of State Street_. At the Effective Time, the State Street

Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of State Street
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to

### (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Investors Financial Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Investors Financial, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of
State Street Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Investors Financial
Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of State Street that the Tax has been paid or is not

regulatory agency, authority, commission or board or other governmental
department, bureau, branch, agency, authority or instrumentality or any non-

or insurance authorities, whether supranational, national, federal, state,
provincial, local or municipal or whether domestic or foreign.

  

### (e) The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the
terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Investors Financial
Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Investors Financial
Common Stock, _subject_ ,  _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or distributions that (i) were declared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement by Investors Financial on the
shares of Investors Financial Common Stock (and that have a record date)
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time or (ii) were
declared by Investors Financial on the shares of Investors Financial Common
Stock prior to the date of this Agreement and, in each case, which remain
unpaid at the Effective

        

### Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Investors Financial Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, any certificates
formerly representing shares of Investors Financial Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### (f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Investors Financial of the shares of Investors Financial
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Investors Financial Common
Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of State
Street Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

  

### (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of State Street
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange,
no dividend or distribution with respect to State Street Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of State Street. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, State Street shall pay to each former stockholder
of Investors Financial who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined
by multiplying (i) the State Street Closing Price, by (ii) the fraction of a
share (after taking into account all shares of Investors Financial Common
Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of State Street Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.4.

  

### (h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Investors Financial as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid to
State Street. In such event, any former stockholders of Investors Financial
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to State Street with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the State Street Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of
Investors Financial Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of State Street, Investors Financial, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Investors Financial Common Stock for any shares of State Street
Common Stock or amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration
or any dividends or distributions with respect to State Street Common Stock
as contemplated by Section 2.3(c) in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent

        

### permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### (i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by State Street or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as State Street may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

## 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, State Street) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of State Street
Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Investors Financial Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or State
Street, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent or State Street, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of Investors Financial Common Stock in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or
State Street, as the case may be.

the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. As of their
respective dates, all Investors Financial SEC Reports complied as to form in
all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto.

  

## 3.6 _Financial Statements_. (a) The financial statements of
Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by
reference) in the Investors Financial SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated
financial position of Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring year-end audit
adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The books and records of Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. Deloitte and Touche LLP has not resigned or
been dismissed as independent public accountants of Investors Financial as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Investors Financial on
a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  

### (b) Neither Investors Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against

        

### on the consolidated balance sheet of Investors Financial included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30,
2006 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

### (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Investors
Financial and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Investors Financial. Investors
Financial (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Investors Financial, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Investors Financial by others within those
entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Investors Financials outside auditors and the audit
committee of Investors Financials Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Investors
Financials ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Investors
Financials internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to Investors Financials
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to
State Street. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that its
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "),
without qualification, when next due.

  

### (d) Since December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither
Investors Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had
or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Investors Financial or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
Investors Financial or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Investors
Financial or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Investors
Financial or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by Investors Financial or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to the Board of Directors of Investors Financial or any committee thereof or
to any director or officer of Investors Financial.

  

(f) None of the Investors Financial Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since
January 1, 2004, been subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Financial Benefit Plan are in compliance with all applicable laws. All
reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all Investors
Financial Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
distributed to any Investors Financial Benefit Plan participant have been
duly and timely filed or distributed (all such reports, returns and similar
documents being accurate and complete in all material respects). Each
Investors Financial Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under
Section 401 and/or 409 of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to such effect and no fact, circumstance or event has
occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Investors Financial Benefit Plan. Each Investors Financial Benefit Plan
required to have been approved by any non-United States Governmental Entity
(or permitted to have been approved to obtain any beneficial Tax or other
status) has been so approved or timely submitted for approval; no
such approval has been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of Investors Financial,
has revocation been threatened) and no circumstance or event has occurred or
exists since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any such approval.
There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Investors Financial, threatened
or anticipated claims by, on behalf of or against any of the Investors
Financial Benefit Plans or any assets thereof (other than routine claims for
benefits).  All contributions, premiums and other payments required to be
made with respect to any Investors Financial Benefit Plan have been made on
or before their due dates under applicable law and the terms of such
Investors Financial Benefit Plan, and with respect to any such contributions,
premiums or other payments required to be made with respect to any Investors
Financial Benefit Plan that are not yet due, to the extent required by GAAP,
adequate reserves are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of
Investors Financial included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 (including any notes thereto) or
liability therefor was incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since September 30, 2006.

        

### (d) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does

or exceeded the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under
such Investors Financial Benefit Plan (whether or not vested) as of the date

employees, former employees, directors or former directors of Investors
Financial or any Investors Financial Subsidiary may accrue additional

liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Investors Financial or any of its

such Investors Financial Benefit Plan and, to Investors Financials
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings
will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of
ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer,
such Investors Financial Benefit Plan. No Investors Financial Benefit Plan is
a multiemployer plan or multiple employer plan within the meaning of Sections
4001(a)(3) or 4063/4064 of ERISA, respectively. Neither Investors Financial
nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, to the knowledge of Investors
Financial, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of any
indemnification or joint and several liability obligation), any liability
pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty Tax, excise Tax or joint
and several liability provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit
plans, in each case, with respect to the Investors Financial Benefit Plans
and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to Investors Financial
or any of its Subsidiaries. There does not now exist, nor do
any circumstances exist that could reasonably result in, any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a liability of Investors Financial or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Closing. "Controlled Group Liability" means

of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of

the Investors Financial Benefit Plans listed in _Section 3.11(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. Proper provision or reserve for each such non-
United States Investors Financial Benefit Plan has been made for accounting
purposes under GAAP to the extent required by GAAP.

  

### (e) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either

benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of Investors Financial or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, officer, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation or (iv) result in the lapsing or waiver of any non-
competition, non-solicitation or non-disclosure covenant, agreement or
contract by which any director, officer or employee of Investors Financial or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound.

        

### (f) Neither Investors Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any labor, trade union, works council or collective bargaining

its Subsidiaries has experienced any such labor related controversy, strike,
slowdown, walkout or other work stoppage within the past three years. Neither

statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines of any
Governmental Entity relating to labor, employment, termination of employment
or similar matters and have not engaged in any unfair labor practices or
similar prohibited practices.

  

(g) No Investors Financial Benefit Plan provides health, medical, life
insurance or other welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of
employment (other than for continuation coverage required under Section
4980(B)(f) of the Code), and no circumstances exist that could result in
Investors Financial or any Investors Financial Subsidiary becoming obligated
to provide any such benefits.

  

(h) No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) by any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) with
respect to Investors Financial will constitute an "excess parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of Investors Financial or any Investors

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto.

  

## 4.6 _Financial Statements_. (a) The financial statements of State Street

State Street and its Subsidiaries; (ii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in

the notes thereto. The books and records of State Street and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions.  Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of State Street as a result of or
in connection with

        

## any disagreements with State Street on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  

### (b) Neither State Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities
that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
State Street included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended September 30, 2006 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since September 30, 2006 or in connection with this Agreement and

### (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of State Street

all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on State Street. State Street (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to State Street, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of State

Streets ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in State Streets
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to State Streets auditors and audit committee and
a copy has previously been made available to Investors Financial. As of the
date hereof, there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

  

(d) Since September 30, 2006, (x) through the date hereof, neither State
Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of State Street or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that State Street or any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (y) no attorney representing State Street or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by State Street or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by State Street or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
State Street or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of State
Street.

Derivative Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are legal,
valid and binding obligations of State Street or a State Street Subsidiary
enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be

### the parties shall cooperate with each other and shall promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation and effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings required to obtain as promptly as practicable
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and
to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental
Entities, including, agreeing to and complying with any actions, conditions
or restrictions required or imposed in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties
and Governmental Entities.  In furtherance of and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each of the parties will take, or cause to be taken, in good
faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable Laws, to lift or rescind
any order, decree, judgment or decision of any Governmental Entity adversely
affecting the parties ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby on a timely basis, to cause to be satisfied the conditions in Article

otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Investors Financial and State Street shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of
information, all the information relating to Investors Financial or State
Street, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which

the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the
consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions

Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be
materially delayed.

to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each
of Investors Financial and State Street shall, and shall cause each of

under this Agreement. Neither Investors Financial nor State Street, nor any
of their Subsidiaries, shall be required to take any actions contemplated by

of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

### (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties as of January 23, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

  

### (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall

## 6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. Investors Financial shall call a special
meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in
connection with the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The board of
directors of Investors Financial has adopted resolutions recommending to the
stockholders of Investors Financial the adoption of this Agreement, and the
board of directors of Investors Financial shall recommend to the stockholders
of Investors Financial the approval and adoption of this Agreement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the meeting of Investors Financial
stockholders to be held pursuant to this Section 6.3, the board of directors
of Investors Financial may withdraw, modify, condition, qualify or refuse to
recommend the adoption of this

        

## Agreement if (a) the board of directors of Investors Financial determines,
in good faith after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors and after taking into account any revisions to this Agreement
proposed by State Street pursuant to clause (b) of this sentence, that
failure to so withdraw, modify, qualify, condition or refuse to recommend the
adoption of this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law and (b) the board of directors of Investors
Financial has provided State Street with five business days prior written
notice of its intent to effect such withdrawal, modification, qualification,
conditioning or refusal to recommend (which notice shall include the
reasonable details regarding the cause for, and the nature of, such
withdrawal, modification, qualification, conditioning or refusal
to recommend) and, if requested by State Street, negotiated in good faith
with State Street during such five business day period regarding revisions to
this Agreement that would avoid such withdrawal, modification,
qualification, conditioning or refusal to recommend (it being agreed that, if
the reason for the proposed action by the board of directors of Investors
Financial is the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, then any amendment to
the price or any material term of such Alternative Proposal shall require a
new notice and a new five business day period).  Notwithstanding any
such withdrawal, modification, condition or refusal to recommend,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders for the purpose of
approving and adopting the Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve Investors Financial of such obligation, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Board of Directors of Investors Financial shall have
withdrawn, modified, qualified, conditioned or refused to recommend the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
then in submitting this Agreement to the stockholders of the Investors
Financial, the board of directors of Investors Financial may submit this
Agreement to the stockholders of Investors Financial without recommendation
(although the resolutions approving and adopting this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of
directors of Investors Financial may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the stockholders of Investors Financial in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law.

  

## 6.4 _Affiliates_. Investors Financial shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of
Investors Financial to deliver to State Street, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of the
Investors Financial stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a
written agreement, in the form of Exhibit A.

  

## 6.5 _NYSE Listing_. State Street shall cause the shares of State Street
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

day of the calendar year that includes the Closing Date, State Street shall,
or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to those
individuals actively employed by Investors Financial or one of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered
Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage and
annual bonus opportunities that are either (i) substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage provided
to such Covered Employees and the aggregate employee benefits and annual
bonus opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the Investors
Financial Benefit

        

## Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
(ii) substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly situated employees of
State Street;  _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of State
Street or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered
Employee at any time or to terminate any specific employee benefit plans,
programs or policies.

  

### (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan maintained by State Street or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries, State
Street shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of
such Covered Employee with Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and, except under any defined benefit
pension plans, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of State
Street or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Investors Financial Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a
participant immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that (A) the recognition of service under this clause (i) shall not operate
to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee and (B) such
service shall not be recognized for any purposes under any retiree welfare
plan of State Street or any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) with respect to any
health, dental or vision plan of State Street or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered
Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year that includes the year
in which such Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate, (x)  cause
any pre-existing condition limitations under such State Street or Subsidiary
plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Investors Financial
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements with respect to such year under any such health, dental or
vision plan of State Street or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

### (c) From and after the Effective Time, State Street shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect
as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof but prior to
the Effective Time only with the prior written consent of State Street,
each employment agreement and change in control agreement of Investors
Financial and its Subsidiaries and the obligations of Investors Financial and
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each deferred compensation
plan or agreement.

  

### (d) Prior to the Closing, State Street shall be entitled to direct
Investors Financial to adopt and implement a retention program for specified
employees of Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries. The terms and
conditions of such program shall be determined by State Street in
its discretion, after consultation with Investors Financial; _provided_
that Investors Financial shall not be obligated to provide any compensation
or benefits under such program prior to the Effective Time and no employee
of Investors Financial shall be required to participate in such program.
Investors Financial shall adopt and implement such program within 30 days of
State Streets delivery to Investors Financial in writing of the terms and
conditions of such program.

        

### (e) The parties agree to the additional matters set forth on Section
6.6(e) of the Investors Financial Disclosure Schedule.

  

### (f) Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section
9.10, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person, including without limitation any Covered
Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement and no provision of this Section 6.6 shall
constitute an amendment of any Investors Financial Benefit Plan.

  

## 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.  (a) In the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "),

any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of Investors Financial or any of its
Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Investors Financial

_Section 6.7_ of the Investors Financial Disclosure Schedule, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after
the Effective Time, except for those set forth in certificates or articles of
organization or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), which shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years

shall require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including fees and
expenses of counsel), fines, penalties, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole
or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of Investors Financial or any Subsidiary of
Investors Financial, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or
any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or
taken at the request of State Street pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof.

        

### (c) State Street shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Investors Financial or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the
Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy
maintained by Investors Financial ( _provided_ that State Street may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such; _provided_ that in no event shall State Street be required to expend
annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Investors Financial (which current amount is set forth in
_Section 6.7_ of the Investors Financial Disclosure Schedule) for such
insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ _further_ that if
State Street is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as
a result of the preceding proviso, State Street shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  

## 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of State Street, on
the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Investors Financial, on the other) or to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger,
the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective
Subsidiaries shall, at State Streets sole expense, take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by State Street.

  

## 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of State Street and Investors Financial
shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or

covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and
_provided_ _further_  that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set
forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse
Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

  

## 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_.  Prior to the
Effective Time, State Street and Investors Financial shall each take all such
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares

or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals
regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of
shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar
transactions involving Investors Financial or any of its Subsidiaries that,
if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the

_Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction,
(iii) approve or enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Proposal
or Alternative Transaction or (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose

to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other
terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into a confidentiality
agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Investors Financial than,
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
the standstill provision contained therein may permit such person to convey
confidentially an Alternative Proposal to the Investors Financial board of
directors under circumstances in which Investors Financial is permitted to
discuss an Alternative Proposal hereunder), consider and participate in
discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal
received by Investors Financial that is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of
Investors Financial reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties.  Investors Financial shall promptly provide to State
Street any non-public information that is provided to the person making such
Alternative Proposal or its representatives which was not previously provided
to State Street.

  

As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a
transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than
State Street or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would
acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Investors Financial Common
Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of
preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect
to the Merger, whether from Investors Financial or pursuant to a tender offer
or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation
or other business combination involving Investors Financial (other than the
Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of
persons) (other than State Street or its affiliates) acquires or would
acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of Investors Financial and securities of the
entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of
Investors Financials Subsidiaries) of Investors Financial, or any of its
Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all
the assets, net revenues or net income of Investors Financial and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or
(iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving Investors Financial or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of
which the holders of shares of Investors Financial Common Stock immediately
prior to such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the
outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the
surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the
consummation thereof in substantially

        

the same proportion as such holders held the shares of Investors Financial
Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation thereof.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any written offer made by a third party that
did not result from a breach of Section 6.11 and that the board of directors
of Investors Financial reasonably determines to be _bona fide_ for a
transaction that, if consummated, would result in such third party (or in the
case of a direct merger between such third party and Investors Financial, the
shareholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, a
majority of the voting power of Investors Financial Common Stock (or, in the
case of a direct merger, common stock of the resulting company) or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of Investors Financial and the
Investors Financial Subsidiaries for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities payable to holders of shares of Investors Financial Common Stock
(i) which is on terms that the board of directors of Investors Financial
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, to be superior from a financial point of view to the
holders of Investors Financial Common Stock than the Merger, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement
(including any offer by State Street to amend the terms of the Merger) and
(ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Alternative
Transaction.

  

### (b) Investors Financial shall notify State Street promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any
material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal,
or any request for nonpublic information relating to Investors Financial or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
Investors Financial or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs
the Board of Directors of Investors Financial or any Subsidiary that it is
considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to
State Street shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the
identity of the Person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to
make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public
information or access to the books and records of Investors Financial or any
Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal.  Investors Financial
shall keep State Street fully informed, on a current basis, of any material
changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms
of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. Investors Financial

orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a).

  

### (c) Investors Financial and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than State Street) conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons
(other than State Street) who have been furnished confidential information
regarding Investors Financial in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months prior to
the date of this Agreement to return or destroy such information.  Investors
Financial agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any
third party from, waive the benefits of, agree to modify in any manner, or
consent to any matter with respect to which consent is required under, the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Investors
Financial or its

        

### Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take
all steps necessary to terminate any release, waiver, modification or consent
that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any
person to make an Alternative Proposal. Neither Investors Financial nor the
Board of Directors of Investors Financial shall approve or take any action to
render inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction
any relevant provisions of the DGCL or any similar Takeover Statutes.

employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives)
of Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions
described in this Section 6.11 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations
thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.11 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative
(including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other retained representative) of Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries, at
the direction or with the consent of Investors Financial or its Subsidiaries,
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.11 by Investors Financial.

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit Investors
Financial or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

any dividends in respect of State Street Common Stock and Investors Financial
Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it

Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for
any quarter with respect to their shares of Investors Financial Common Stock
and any shares of State Street Common Stock any such holder receives
in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  

6.13. _Transfer Taxes._ All stock transfer, real estate transfer,

connection with the Transactions shall be paid by State Street, and Investors

and its affiliates shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
so qualify. Investors Financial shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz or another nationally
recognized counsel, and State Street shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the opinion of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP or another
nationally recognized counsel, in each case, to the effect that the Merger

not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of
this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in
this Agreement;

  

### (d) by either State Street or Investors Financial (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have
been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
Investors Financial, in the case of a termination by State Street, or State
Street, in the case of a termination by Investors Financial, which breach,
either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 45 days
following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature
or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

  

### (e) by State Street, if the Board of Directors of Investors Financial
shall have (i) failed to recommend in the Proxy Statement the approval and
adoption of this Agreement, (ii) in a manner adverse to State Street, (x)
withdrawn, modified, qualified or conditioned, the recommendation by such
Board of Directors of this Agreement and/or the Merger to Investors
Financials stockholders, or publicly proposed to do so, or (y) approved or
recommended any Alternative Proposal (or, in the case of clause (ii),
resolved to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the
terms hereof or (iii) intentionally breached its obligations under Section
6.3 or 6.11 in any material respect; or

   

53  

   

### (f) by either State Street or Investors Financial, if the stockholders of
Investors Financial fail to adopt this Agreement at the special meeting of
Investors Financial stockholders called for the purpose of obtaining
the requisite stockholder approval required in connection with the Merger or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.4, specifying the
provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

  

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Investors Financial or State Street as provided in
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,
and none of Investors Financial, State Street, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that (i)
Sections 3.7, 4.7, 6.2(b), 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9
and 9.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) neither
Investors Financial nor State Street shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

  

## 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except with respect to costs and expenses of
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid
to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall be borne equally by
Investors Financial and State Street, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

## 8.4 _Termination Fee_. (a) In the event that (i) a Pre-Termination
Takeover Proposal Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred after
the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either State Street or Investors Financial pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or
8.1(f), and (ii) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
of such termination Investors Financial consummates or enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction, Investors
Financial shall, on the earlier of the date of such entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummation of, an Alternative Transaction,
pay State Street a fee equal to $165,000,000 by wire transfer of same day
funds.

  

### (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by State Street
pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then Investors Financial shall pay State Street a
fee equal to $165,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds within two
business days of the date of termination.

  

### (c) For purposes of this Section 8.4, a " _Pre-Termination Takeover
Proposal Event_ " shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise
to the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona fide Alternative Proposal
shall have been made known to Investors Financial or any of its Subsidiaries
or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Alternative Proposal (the term Alternative Transaction, as used in the
definition of Alternative Proposal for purposes of this Section 8.4, and as
used in this Section 8.4, shall have the same meaning set

        

### forth in Section 6.11 except that the references to "more than 25%" and
"at least 75%" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more" and "a
majority," respectively);

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum
aggregate amount of fees payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
$165,000,000.

  

### (e) Investors Financial acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, State Street would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Investors Financial fails promptly
to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.4, and, in order to obtain
such payment, State Street commences a suit which results in a judgment
against Investors Financial for the fee set forth in this Section 8.4,
Investors Financial shall pay to State Street its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

  

## 8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with Merger
by the stockholders of Investors Financial; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
stockholders of Investors Financial, there may not be, without
further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement
that (a) alters or changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Investors Financial
Common Stock, alters or changes any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of
any securities of Investors Financial, in each case other than as
contemplated by this Agreement, or (c) requires any further stockholder
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

  

## 8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

## 9.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The Investors Financial
Disclosure Schedule and the State Street Disclosure Schedule, as well as all
other schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. This Agreement
shall not be interpreted or construed to require any person to take any
action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable
law.

  

## 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each
party need not sign the same counterpart.

  

## 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than
the Confidentiality Agreement.

        

## 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
applicable to contracts made and wholly-performed within such state, without
regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles, except to the extent
that the DGCL or the MBCA applies. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court
located in New York, New York (or, to the extent that subject matter or
personal jurisdiction does not exist in any such federal court, then in any
New York state court located in New York County). Each of the parties hereto
submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction
derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or
proceeding.  Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court other than any New York state court located in New York
County or any Federal court located in New York, New York. Each party waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## 9.9 _Publicity_. Neither Investors Financial nor State Street shall, and
neither Investors Financial nor State Street shall permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public
statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of State
Street, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Investors
Financial, or Investors Financial, in the case of a proposed announcement or
statement by State Street; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may,
without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation
with the other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement to
the extent required by law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq or
the NYSE, as applicable.

  

## 9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, and,
solely if specific performance is sought by Investors Financial but is not
legally available as a remedy, except for the ability of Investors Financial
to bring any action, permitted under clause (ii) of Section 8.2, on behalf of
its stockholders, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this
Agreement.

        

## 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger
and State Streets obligation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and
amounts payable in respect of Investors Financial Options and other equity-
based awards pursuant to the Merger, subject in each case to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement) in any federal court located in the State of
New York (or, to the extent that subject matter or personal jurisdiction
does not exist in any such federal court, then in any New York state court
located in New York County), in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.
