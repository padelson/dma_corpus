Letter), in each case, that are not less than those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii)&nbsp;employee benefits (including retirement, health and welfare benefits, but excluding defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health and life insurance benefits
and equity compensation) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. This </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;7.07</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> shall not limit the
obligation of Parent to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing
Contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one (1)&nbsp;year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this

collective agreements and employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employee's service
with any Acquired Company, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Acquired Companies, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual or
eligibility purposes under any employee benefit plan of Parent that is a defined benefit pension plan or a post-retirement health and life insurance plan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent

Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have been
applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Acquired Companies, and (ii)&nbsp;give full credit under the welfare plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums,

construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent or any other Parent Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, (x)&nbsp;the amounts the Company
is entitled to collect, if due, are those specified in clause&nbsp;(A), clause&nbsp;(B), and clause&nbsp;(C), as applicable and are intended to serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate liability
of the Parent Parties under this Agreement in the event Parent fails to effect the Closing in accordance with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;2.01</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or otherwise breaches
this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder and under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect, if due, more than the amounts specified in such clauses, and (y)&nbsp;while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;9.03(d)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, as the case may be, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance to consummate the Transaction pursuant to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;9.02</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;9.03</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> are an integral part
of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor the Company would
enter into this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall (x)&nbsp;the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or any other
amounts due under Section&nbsp;9.03(g) on more than one occasion or (y)&nbsp;Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee or any of the reimbursement, interest or other amounts due under </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;7.13(c)

parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including, subject to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be, subject to </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (including the
limitations therein), entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any
party is entitled at law or in equity. Subject to the terms of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement),
the End Date shall automatically be extended to (i)&nbsp;the twentieth (20<SUP>th</SUP>) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii)&nbsp;such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding (it being understood that this </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.02</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is not intended and
