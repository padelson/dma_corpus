 Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time Parent shall select a nationally recognized financial institution (the identity and terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, other than the Cancelled Shares, restricted shares pursuant to a Company Restricted Stock Award and except for any Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited (i) with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (ii) with the Company, cash in an amount sufficient such that the Company has sufficient cash on hand to pay the aggregate Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Compensatory Award Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund or the Compensatory Award Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with the Merger contemplated by _Section 3.01_ or _Section 3.05_, respectively, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional cash with the Paying Agent or the Company, as 

        

applicable, in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required pay the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration or the RS/RSU
Consideration, as applicable. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued
pursuant to _Section 3.01_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Surviving
Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, shall pay through payroll
(subject to withholding and deductions required by Applicable Law) the Option
Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to
_Section 3.05_ out of the Compensatory Award Fund. The Exchange Fund and
the Compensatory Award Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree. 

   

 (c) Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two (2) Business Days), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment. 

  

 (e) _ Registered Holders._ If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of 

        

the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

   

 (f) _ No Transfers; No Further Ownership_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_. 

   

 (g) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock after the date which is one (1) year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not exchanged his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 3.02_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards for any Merger Consideration, Option Consideration or RS/RSU Consideration that is required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount required to ensure the Exchange Fund has sufficient cash to pay any remaining Merger Consideration required to be paid hereunder, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent. 

  

 (i) All Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration issued or paid upon conversion of the Company Common Stock, the Company Options, the Company Restricted Stock Awards or the Company RSU Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company Options, the Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSU Awards, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 3.03 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or 

        

destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a customary bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_. 

   

 Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Acquired Companies and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation consideration payable to any holder or former holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSU Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or otherwise under any Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and, if required by Applicable Law, paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, an Acquired Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 3.05 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards, Company ESPPs. 

  

 (a) _ Company Options._ Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "), subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld. Each holder of an outstanding Company Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the Option Consideration, if any, and Parent shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company Option through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, following the Closing Date). For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option, whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, the Company Option will automatically terminate and be canceled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof. 

  

 (b) _ Company RSU Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards._ Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding and each Company Restricted Stock Award that remains outstanding and unvested shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (A) underlying such Company RSU Award or (B) granted pursuant to such Restricted Stock Award, as applicable and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _RS/RSU Consideration_ "), subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld. Each holder of an outstanding Company RSU Award and/or Company Restricted Stock Award shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the RS/RSU Consideration 

        

and Parent shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company
RSU Award or Company Restricted Stock Award, as applicable, through the
payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as
applicable, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event
later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving
Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, following the Closing
Date).

  

 (c) _ Company ESPPs._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPPs that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPPs shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the termination of the Company ESPPs, any funds that remain within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant shall be returned to such participant. With respect to any offering period outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPPs, promptly following the date of this Agreement, each option granted pursuant to the Company ESPPs shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) Business Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which such offering period would otherwise end, and no additional offering period shall commence under the Company ESPPs after the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Effective Time does not occur prior to the End Date, the Company and Parent agree to negotiate in good faith to permit the commencement of new offering periods under the Company ESPPs. 

   

 (d) _ Certain Actions._ Not less than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send a written notice to each holder of an outstanding Company Option, Company Restricted Stock Award or Company RSU Award and to each participant in any Company ESPP that shall inform such holder or participant of the treatment of the Company Compensatory Awards provided in this _Section 3.05_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, as applicable, any committee thereof administering any of the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as it deems necessary or advisable to effectuate the treatment of Company Compensatory Awards set forth in this _Section 3.05_. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the Surviving Corporation will not be bound at the Effective Time by any options, stock appreciation rights, units or other right, awards or arrangements under any stock incentive plan of the Company that would entitle any Person after the Effective Time to beneficially own any Company Common Stock (or any derivative securities thereof) or to receive any payments in respect thereof, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company\'s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company\'s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 3.06 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (each such share, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to 

        

appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each
such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company will give Parent prompt
written notice (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) of all
written demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and Applicable Law and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting
Shares. Parent shall have the right to direct and control all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Shares. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
3.02(a)_ to pay for any shares that are Dissenting Shares shall be returned
to Parent upon demand.

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions.

   

 Section 5.06 No Brokers. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or other financial intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any of Parent or its Subsidiaries who will be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, in connection with the Transactions. 

  

 Section 5.07 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company. 

  

 (b) Other than as may be provided pursuant to the Voting Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (i) any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration, (ii) any stockholder of the Company (A) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (B) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any Third Party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity capital to Parent to finance in whole or in part the Merger other than the Equity Commitment Letter and the Preferred Equity Financing. 

  

 Section 5.08 Financial Capacity. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (a) an executed equity commitment letter dated the date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), to provide the Equity Financing in cash in an aggregate amount of at least $790,000,000, (b) an executed preferred equity commitment letter dated the date hereof (as amended, supplemented or replaced in compliance with this Agreement or as required by _Section 7.14_ following a Financing Failure Event, the " _Preferred Equity Commitment Letter_ "), to provide the Preferred Equity Financing in cash in an aggregate amount of at least $575,000,000, and (c) the executed Debt Commitment Letter. None of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or arrangement relating to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters and the fee letters and engagement letter related thereto, as applicable. The aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions related thereto), the Equity Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company RSU Awards will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, and to pay all fees and expenses required to be paid by Verscend Holding, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, the commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Verscend Holding and, to the Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Verscend Holding, each other party thereto (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions. Verscend Holding has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or 

        

prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the
part of Verscend Holding or, to the Knowledge of Parent or the knowledge of
Verscend Holding, any other party to the Commitment Letters, in each case
under any term of the Commitment Letters. Assuming (x) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ (subject to all
Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality and knowledge qualifications
contained therein), (y) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the covenants set forth in _Section 7.13_ and (z) the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations to
consummate the Merger, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Verscend
Holding have no reason to believe that Verscend Holding or any other party
thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of any of
the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date
that will be included in the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing
Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming (x) the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ (subject to
all materiality and knowledge qualifications contained therein), (y) the
performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth in
_Section 7.13_ and (z) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations to consummate the Merger, as of the
date of this Agreement, Parent and Verscend Holding have no reason to believe
that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the
Financing will not be made available to Verscend Holding on the Closing Date.
Parent and Merger Sub expressly agree and acknowledge that their obligations
hereunder, including Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations to
consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Verscend
Holding\'s, Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s receipt of financing.

  

 Section 5.09 Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any Acquired Company. Assuming (x) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ (without regard to any of the Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality and knowledge qualifications contained therein), (y) the performance in all material respects by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth in _Section 7.13_ and (z) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_, as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.09_, the term "solvent" means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business.

The information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, at the date mailed to the Company\'s stockholders and at the time of the meeting of the Company\'s stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, Parent and Merger Sub do not make any representations or warranties with respect to information in the Proxy Statement that is not supplied by or on behalf of 

        

Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or that is
inconsistent with information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

   

 Section 5.11 Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. All of the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its formation, this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective Time have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person. 

  

 Section 5.12 Company Arrangements. Other than this Agreement and as may be provided pursuant to the Voting Agreement, as of the date hereof, none of Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective executive officers, directors or Affiliates, has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the executive officers, directors or Affiliates of the Company relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company. 

  

 Section 5.13 Investment Intention. Parent is acquiring through the Transactions the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any "blue sky" Laws and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any applicable "blue sky" Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such registration. 

   

 Section 5.14 No Additional Representations and Warranties. Except as provided in this _Article V_ or in any certificate to be delivered by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub). Parent acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties explicitly set forth in _Article IV_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) (or any of their respective Representatives) makes or has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty at law or in equity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 Section 6.02 Competing Proposals 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this _Section 6.02_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their other Representatives: 

  

  

 (i) from and after the execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions, solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; 

  

 (ii) from and after the execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, not directly or indirectly (A) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request relating to, or that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information relating to the Acquired Companies to, or afford access to the properties, books or records or employees of the Acquired Companies to, any Third Party with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver of or terminate any "standstill" or similar agreement or obligation of any Third Party with respect to the Acquired Companies to allow such Third Party to submit an Acquisition Proposal, (C) other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)(iii)_, approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (D) agree, propose or resolve to take, or take, any of the actions prohibited by the foregoing clause (A) through clause (C); and

the prompt return or destruction of all confidential and non-public
information previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any
Acquired Company or any of its Representatives.

  

  

 Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any breach of the restrictions or obligations set forth in _Section 6.02_ by any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representatives of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries, shall be a breach of _Section 6.02_ by the Company. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.02(a)_, if at any time prior to adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement from a Third Party and that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_ (other than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional), (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that (y) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and (z) its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law, and (iii) the Company negotiates and receives from such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (and which shall not prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of this _Section 6.02_, it being understood and agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits the counterparty thereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from making an Acquisition Proposal), then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to this _Section 6.02_, (A) furnish non-public information, and afford access to the books or records or officers of the Acquired Companies, to such Third Party and its Affiliates and Representatives and (B) engage in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party and its Affiliates and representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that any such non-public information that is in writing concerning the Acquired Companies made available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously made available to Parent, be made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is made available to such Third Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 6.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives may, in any event (without the Company Board having to make the determination in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence), contact any such Third Party to (i) seek to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any such Third Party solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) inform any such Third Party of the provisions of this _Section 6.02_. 

  

 (c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.02(c)_, _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 6.02(e)_, until the earlier of the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval or the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall or shall propose publicly to (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, change, amend or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation; (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iii) fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four (4) Business Days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so (it being agreed that neither the delivery of a notice by the Company described in _Section 6.02(d)_ nor any public announcement thereof shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); (iv) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, fail to recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal within four (4) Business Days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so (it being agreed that neither the delivery of a notice by the Company described in _Section 6.02(d)_ nor any public announcement thereof shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); (v) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company\'s stockholders); (vi) approve, adopt, declare advisable or 

        

recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions described in clause
(i) through clause (vi) of this _Section 6.02(c)_, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or (vii) adopt or approve, or cause or permit the
Company to enter into or otherwise resolve or agree to any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.02(b)(iii_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, if at any time prior to the receipt of the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company Board may, subject to
first complying with _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 6.02(e)_, as
applicable, make an Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in response to an
Intervening Event or (ii) if the Company Board receives an unsolicited bona
fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.02_ (other than any breach that is
both immaterial and unintentional) and, in the case of each of clause (i)
and clause (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable
Law and (B) in the event the Company Board receives an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.02_ (other than any breach that is both
immaterial and unintentional) and the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall be
permitted, to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_
and enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection
with such Superior Proposal, if and only if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors,
that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
stockholders under Applicable Law, subject to the Company first complying with
_Section 6.02(d) _ and substantially concurrently with entering into any
such definitive agreement (1) the Company validly terminates this Agreement
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.01(h)_ and (2) the Company
pays the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 9.03(b) _.

  

 (d) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ unless (i) the Company has provided, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes, written notice of the material terms of the Superior Proposal which enabled the Company Board to make the determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following the time of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal such that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the director\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law; and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause (ii), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, after considering in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions offered by Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the director\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law. In the event of any amendment or modification to the amount or form of consideration payable in connection with the 

        

Superior Proposal or any material amendment or modification to any other term
of the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to issue a new Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.02(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
for purposes of this sentence, references to the three (3) Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period from the time of Parent\'s receipt of such new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  

 (e) Other than in connection with effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or causing the Company to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (which, in each case, shall be subject to _Section 6.02(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 6.02(e)_), the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, only if, prior to such action (i) the Company has provided, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change to Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes, a reasonably detailed summary of the facts, events and/or circumstances of and relating to the Intervening Event and the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following the time of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions such that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the director\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law; and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause (ii), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, after considering in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions offered by Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Intervening Event giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute an Intervening Event and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the director\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law. 

  

 (f) From and after the execution of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party or any request for non-public information or offer or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the identity of such Third Party and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request, offer or inquiry and, in the case of written materials (including any financing commitments received), provide Parent copies of all such materials, (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) make available to Parent copies of all materials provided by the Company to such Third Party but not previously made available to Parent and (iii) the Company shall provide Parent with reasonably prompt written notice setting forth such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed of material oral or written communications regarding, and the status and material details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of, any such Acquisition Proposal or other request, offer or inquiry. 

       

                                    

    

 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Company\'s stockholders) (provided that such disclosure does not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii) making any other legally required communication to the Company\'s stockholders with regard to the Transactions if (in the case of this clause (iii)) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall this _Section 6.02(g)_ affect the obligations specified in _Section 6.02(c)_ and (B) any such disclosure (other than making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to Company Board Recommendation without disclosing any Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 Section 6.03 Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, afford to Parent and its Representatives, and to the Financing Sources and their respective Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the Acquired Companies ( _provided_ , that the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall use its reasonable best efforts to make arrangements for such access in a manner that minimized the likelihood of unreasonable interference), to their respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records and appropriate Representatives of the Acquired Companies, and shall furnish such Representatives with existing financial and operating data and other information concerning the affairs, business, property and personnel of the Acquired Companies as such Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , that such investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall be at Parent\'s sole cost and expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall require the Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate Applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired Company is a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (it being agreed that, with respect to clause (i), the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not cause such violation or jeopardy; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of soil, groundwater or building materials, or other similar invasive techniques at any of the Acquired Companies\' properties. All information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder, or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure made by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates to the Financing Sources or rating agencies in connection with efforts or activities by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing.

 (b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section 7.01_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental Authority regarding the approval of the Merger or any of the other Transactions; (iv) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any additional requests for information received by any party from any Antitrust Authority or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions or filings contemplated by _Section 7.01(a)_; and (v) use reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act and such other approvals, consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or advisable under any Applicable Laws and (B) prevent the entry in any action or proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted pursuant to this _Section 7.01(b)_ to a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or any of the other Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by Applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto will permit Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted pursuant to this _Section 7.01_ to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any Applicable Law, Parent shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and shall undertake (and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to undertake) promptly any and all action to complete lawfully the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and all action 

        

necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or
threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any
Governmental Authority or the issuance of any Governmental Order that would
(or to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Authority to the
Transactions the absence of which would) delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or
otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including (i) proffering
and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement
providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding
separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, or limiting any freedom

business and (ii) promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding
separate of assets or lines of business, in each case, at such time as may be
necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior

a Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the Transactions but
requiring any assets or lines of business to be sold, licensed or otherwise
disposed or held separate thereafter (including with respect to the business
and assets of the Acquired Companies) shall not, individually, or in the
aggregate (together with one or more other changes, events, circumstances,
developments or facts) be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified
in _Article VIII_.

  

 (d) Each party hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with the other parties as to any Government Contract administration matters that may arise prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with the other (or its designee) in addressing inquiries from CMS regarding the Transaction and, in the event CMS requests an updated organizational conflict of interest disclosure, will reasonably consult with the other (or its designee) to prepare and submit such updated disclosure. 

  

 (e) Parent shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing costs associated with all required filings under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law. 

  

 Section 7.02 Proxy Statement 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but, assuming Parent\'s timely performance of its obligations under _Section 7.02(b)_, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form, as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to be made with the SEC within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement. Except as contemplated by _Section 6.02_, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in no event more than five Business Days after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or 

        

misleading;  _provided_ , _however_ that (i) notwithstanding the foregoing,
no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied
by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and (ii) updates
thereafter in responses to claims shall not _per se_ be deemed to be a breach
for purposes of this _Section 7.02(a)_. Prior to filing and prior to mailing
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments (whether written, oral or otherwise) of the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on
such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of
such document or response) to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, and
no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be filed without the
approval of the Company and Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that the Company may
amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the review or comment of
Parent in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance
with this Agreement.

  

 (b) Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (c) In accordance with the Company\'s organizational documents, Applicable Law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but subject to the timing contemplated in _Section 7.02(a)_), (x) establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") and (y) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders Meeting a Proxy Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on or around the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to Company stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) if the Company reasonably believes it is necessary to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under Applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Company\'s stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. In no event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent\'s prior written consent, unless required by Applicable Law. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company\'s stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Unless the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Required Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts 

        

and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement.
Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section 9.01_, the Company shall establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for
the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement, whether or not the
Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Company\'s or Parent\'s Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party shall promptly inform the others, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared by the Company and (subject to Parent\'s review and comment as described above) filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 (e) If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to Applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " _Other Required Company Filing_ "), then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Any and all Other Required Company Filings shall be subject to same right of review, comment and notice of Parent provided above with respect to the Proxy Statement. 

  

 Section 7.03 Confidentiality; Public Announcements. The parties shall issue a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and agree that such initial press release shall be in the form agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by _Section 6.02_ (and for the avoidance of doubt nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Company or the Company Board under _Section 6.02_), prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or public announcement prior to obtaining the other parties\' consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary (a) to the extent disclosure may be required by Applicable Law, Governmental Order or applicable national stock exchange rule, (b) for disclosures made in the ordinary course by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates to their existing or prospective investors and limited partners, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, or (c) in connection with any actions by the Company or the Company Board expressly permitted by _Section 6.02_. The Company may, without Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s consent, communicate to its employees, customers, suppliers and consultants in a manner consistent with prior communications of the Company or consistent with a communications plan previously agreed to by Parent and the Company in which case such communications may be made only to the extent such communications are substantially consistent with such prior communications or such plan, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth therein or herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure made by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates to the Financing Sources and rating agencies in connection with efforts or activities by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing. 

        

 Section 7.04 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, would have been required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or other organizational documents, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person. Parent also agrees to advance expenses as incurred by each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired Companies to the fullest extent required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or other organizational documents, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time: (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation (including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Acquired Companies\' former and current officers, directors and employees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the requirements under Applicable Law and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements, and other organizational documents of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect in any material respect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) The Company shall cause coverage to be extended under the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing Date a prepaid, non-cancelable six (6)-year "tail" insurance policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 7.04_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_. 

  

 (d) Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 7.04_. 

  

 Section 7.05 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company RSU Awards or other securities in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 7.06 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall reasonably promptly advise Parent of, and keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis regarding, any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, the Company shall give Parent the 

        

opportunity (at Parent\'s sole cost and expense) to participate in the
defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not settle or offer to settle any such
stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

 Section 7.07 Employee Matters 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for each employee who continues in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i) base salary, target cash incentive opportunity and severance benefits (with respect to severance benefits, to the extent set forth in an Employee Plan listed in _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), in each case, that are not less than those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (including retirement, health and welfare benefits, but excluding defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health and life insurance benefits and equity compensation) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. This _Section 7.07_ shall not limit the obligation of Parent to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing Contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one (1) year. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, _provided_ that any such termination is effected in accordance with Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee full credit for his or her years of service with the Company for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under any employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave entitlements, termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employee\'s service with any Acquired Company, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by the Acquired Companies, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual or eligibility purposes under any employee benefit plan of Parent that is a defined benefit pension plan or a post-retirement health and life insurance plan. 

  

 (c) Parent shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Acquired Companies, and (ii) give full credit under the welfare plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer. 

  

 (d) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and contingent upon the occurrence of the 

        

Closing, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall
become fully vested in any unvested portion of their Company 401(k) Plan
accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If such request to terminate
the Company 401(k) Plan is made, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no later
than immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent on the Closing)
pursuant to resolutions of the Company. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to prior review by Parent. If the Company
401(k) Plan is terminated, Parent shall designate a tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is
sponsored by the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k)
Plan_ ") that will cover Continuing Employees effective as of the Effective
Time. In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent
shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k) Plan the
"direct rollover" of the account balance (including the in-kind rollover of
promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) of each Continuing Employee
who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is
terminated and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of
the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code. The Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall cooperate in good faith to take any and all commercially reasonable
actions needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan
balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated
to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan after
the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the promissory
notes evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k)
Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the extent
reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to
such outstanding loans.

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) require Parent to continue any incentive or benefit plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time or (ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any incentive or benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 7.07_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or other Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.07_ shall create such rights in any such Persons. 

  

 Section 7.08 Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals required in order to consummate the Transactions pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent so requests and at the sole expense of Parent, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay any such fee or grant any such concession (subject in the case of concessions to being conditioned on Closing) in order to obtain any such consents (and Parent shall provide the Company with such amounts in order to make any such payment). 

  

 Section 7.09 Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall, after becoming aware, give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub in writing of: (i) (x) any representation or warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(a) _ would not be satisfied or (y) any failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_ would not be satisfied; and (ii) the occurrence or existence of any event, change, circumstance, condition, development, occurrence or state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of 

        

such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and (ii) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party\'s Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Parent shall give prompt notice, after becoming aware, to the
Company in writing of (i) (x) any representation or warranty made by the
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.03(a)_ would not be
satisfied or (y) any failure of the Parent or Merger Sub to comply with any
covenant or agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.03(b)_ would not be satisfied and
(ii) the occurrence or existence of any event, change, circumstance,
condition, development, occurrence or state of facts that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement on a
timely basis. No notification under this _Section 7.09_ shall affect
the representations or warranties of the notifying party or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder.

  

 Section 7.10 Stock Exchange Delisting. Each of the parties hereto agrees to reasonably cooperate with the other parties in taking or causing to be taken all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Company\'s securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act following the Effective Time in compliance with Applicable Law ( _provided_ , that such de-listing and de-registration shall not be effective until after the Effective Time).

Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make any investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise as required in connection with the Transactions.

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall in no event be required to provide (or cause its Subsidiaries or the respective Representatives and Affiliates of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide) such assistance that shall unreasonably interfere with its or its Subsidiaries\' business operations.

 _provided_ that (v) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will be required to make any filings with the SEC in connection with the Debt Financing (other than in any applicable proxy statement), except for any information with respect to the Acquired Companies included in documents with respect 

        

to the Debt Financing, after consultation between Parent and the Company,
which may be required to be furnished by the Company on Form 8-K to satisfy
the Company\'s Regulation FD disclosure obligations; provided that the
Acquired Companies consented to the inclusion of such information in such
documents with respect to the Debt Financing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), (w) nothing in this _Section 7.13_ shall require any
such action to the extent it would (1) unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Acquired Companies or require the Acquired
Companies to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or give any
indemnities, in any case prior to the Closing, for which Parent does not
promptly reimburse or indemnify it, as the case may be, under this Agreement
or (2) require the Company, any Company Party or their respective

governing body) of any Acquired Company shall be required to adopt resolutions

legal privilege or (3) violate any applicable confidentiality obligation of
any Acquired Company.

  

 (b) The Company shall not be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing and that does not terminate without liability to the Company and its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement (other than customary prepayment notices). The Company shall not be required to deliver or cause the delivery of any legal opinions or reliance letters in connection with the Debt Financing. 

   

 (c) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquired Companies, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, costs or expenses suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing or any information, assistance or activities provided in connection therewith (other than to the extent such losses arise from historical information provided by the Company or its Representatives or the gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this _Section 7.13_ by the Company or its Representatives). Parent shall promptly reimburse the Acquired Companies for any and all documented out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives in connection with the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing or such assistance. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (and without any waiver or modification of the requirement regarding completion of the Marketing Period contained in _Section 2.01_ hereof), it is understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in _Section 8.02(b)_, as applied to the Company\'s obligations under this _Section 7.13_, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless both (i) the Debt Financing has not been obtained and (ii) a condition precedent to the Debt Commitment Letter was not satisfied, in each case, as a direct result of the Company\'s material breach of its obligations under this _Section 7.13_. 

  

 (e) On or prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause the agent under the Amended and Restated First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2016 (the " _Existing Credit Agreement_ "), by and among Cotiviti Corporation, the subsidiaries of Cotiviti Corporation party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the issuing banks party thereto, to provide a copy of an executed payoff letter (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") containing customary provisions regarding repayment of obligations thereunder and release of related liens. 

        

 Section 7.14 Financing 

   

 (a) Verscend Holding and Parent shall take, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and do, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain and consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters until the Closing ( _provided_ that the Commitment Letters may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as permitted pursuant to _Section 7.14(b)_); (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions applicable to Verscend Holding and within the control of Verscend Holding or Parent to obtaining the Financing; (iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Preferred Equity Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on such other terms acceptable to Verscend Holding and its Financing Sources; (iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, causing the full amount of the Financing to be funded; and (v) enforcing Verscend Holding\'s rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter in the event of a Financing Failure Event. 

  

 (b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach, repudiation or threatened in writing breach or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter of which Parent or its Affiliates becomes aware. Without limiting Verscend Holding\'s or Parent\'s other obligations under this _Section 7.14_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Verscend Holding shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources (on terms containing no new or additional conditions to the consummation of such financing), in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing subject only to the Financing Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the foregoing require Verscend Holding to, and Verscend Holding shall not be required to, agree to any terms or conditions materially less favorable (taken as whole and taking into account any "market flex" provision) to Verscend Holding (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Verscend Holding), in each case relative to those in the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing, as applicable, being replaced. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement or replace any of the Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Document except (x) for substitutions and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and (y) any amendment, modification, supplement or replacement that does not (A) add new (or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent, or make less likely to occur, the funding of the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing) on the Closing Date, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing below the amount (together with the amount from the Equity Financing) required to consummate the Transactions and to pay related fees and expenses or (C) adversely impacts in any material respect the ability of Verscend Holding to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, the Preferred Equity Financing Documents, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Documents as so amended, replaced, supplemented, otherwise modified or waived, relative to the ability of Verscend Holding to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in the Preferred Equity Financing Documents and Debt Financing Documents prior to giving effect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing 

        

herein shall prevent Parent from amending and restating the Commitment
Letters in order to add lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents,
investors, co-investors or similar entities which had not executed the
applicable Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed in
reasonable detail of the status of Verscend Holding\'s efforts to arrange the
Financing upon request. Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree
that their obligations under this Agreement, including their obligations to
consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on,
Verscend Holding\'s, Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s receipt of financing.

  

 (c) Parent shall cause Verscend Holding to take the actions and comply with the obligation of Verscend Holding set forth in this Agreement and to comply with all of the obligations contemplated by the Debt Financing (and under the Debt Commitment Letter) and the Preferred Equity Financing (and under the Preferred Equity Financing Documents).

Nothing in this _Section 9.03(c)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which the Company or any other Company Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transactions (including the Debt Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent or Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 10.02_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)(i)_ or _Section 10.02_, as the case may be, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to consummate the Transaction pursuant to _Section 10.02_ and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to (x) the indemnification and reimbursement obligations set forth in _Section 7.13(c)_ and (y) an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 10.02_, the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this _Article IX_ and receive from Parent the Parent Termination Fee, if due pursuant to _Section 9.03(d)_, shall, in the event Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing or otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder (whether willful, intentional or otherwise), constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against (i) Parent, (ii) Merger Sub, (iii) any of Parent\'s and any of its Subsidiaries\' (including Merger Sub\'s) former, current and future Affiliates and (iv) any of their respective assignees, stockholders, general or limited partners, equityholders, members, managers, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources and other Representatives (the Persons described in clause (i), clause (ii), clause (iii) and clause (iv) collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") for any breach, loss, claim, liability, cost, fee, expense, judgment, inquiry, fine or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Commitment Letters, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement (solely subject to the terms therein, as may have been modified by this Agreement from time to time)), and upon payment of (A) the Parent Termination Fee (if payable), plus (B) the reimbursement obligations set forth in _Section 7.13(c)_, plus (C) such indemnification and reimbursement and interest amounts, if any, referenced in _Section 9.03(g)_, no Person shall have any rights or claims against the Parent Parties under this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise, and the Parent Parties shall not have any other liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction. Nothing in this _Section 9.03(e)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent or any other Parent Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the amounts the Company is entitled to collect, if due, are those specified in clause (A), clause (B), and clause (C), as applicable and are intended to serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties under this Agreement in the event Parent fails to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.01_ or otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder and under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect, if due, more than the amounts specified in such clauses, and (y) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 10.02_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.03(d)_, as the case may be, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to consummate the Transaction pursuant to _Section 10.02_ and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. 

  

 (f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in _Section 9.02_ and _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 Section 10.02 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. 

  

 (a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including, subject to _Section 10.02(b)_, failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be, subject to _Section 10.02(b)_ (including the limitations therein), entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Subject to the terms of _Section 10.02(b)_, each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding (it being understood that this _Section 10.02_ is not intended and shall not be construed to limit in any way the provisions of _Section 9.03(c)_ or _Section 9.03(e)_. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding  _Section 10.02(a)_ or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or specific performance, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, of Parent\'s obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and thereafter to cause the Closing to occur if, and only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such date and the date on 

        

which the Closing would occur if the remedy herein were granted), (ii) the
Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (including any alternative
financing that has been obtained in accordance with _Section 7.13_) has been
funded in accordance with the terms thereof, or are capable of being funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing upon delivery of a drawdown
notice by Parent or notice from Parent that the Equity Financing will be
funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub are required to consummate
the Transactions in accordance with _Section 2.01_ and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able
to consummate the Closing and if such specific performance is granted pursuant
to this _Section 10.02_ and if the Equity Financing, Preferred Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing would occur.

  

 Section 10.03 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires performance prior to the Closing) in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall terminate at the Effective Time, except that this _Section 10.03_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in part after the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers 

  

 (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment or waiver shall be made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval which requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the DGCL or the organizational documents of the Company without such further stockholder approval; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, this _Section 10.04_, and _Section 10.06_, _Section 10.07_, _Section 10.08_, _Section 10.09_ and  _Section 10.13_ (and any related definitions to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such definitions would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources party to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter. 

  

 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 10.05 Disclosure Letter References. The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) would be reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto. The listing of any information on a party\'s Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information or any similar information in such Disclosure Letter, by such party, or to otherwise imply, that such information or any similar information is material, is required to be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a 

        

party\'s Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by
such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a party\'s
Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such
party\'s representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this
Agreement.

  

 Section 10.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. 

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by each party hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the past, present and future officers, directors and employees of the Acquired Companies (and their successors and heirs) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section 7.04_ applicable to such Persons and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Compensatory Awards shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the rights of such Persons to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to and in accordance with _Article III_; (iii) the Company Parties and Parent Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 9.03_; and (iv) the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on this _Section 10.06_ and _Section 10.04_, _Section 10.07_, _Section 10.08_, _Section 10.09_ and _Section 10.13_. 

  

 (b) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) may assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof, and Parent shall have the right, without the prior written consent of the Company, to assign all or any portion of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Verscend Holding or one or more Subsidiaries of Verscend Holding, provided that such assignment would not materially delay, impair or prevent consummation of the Merger and shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section 10.06(b)_ shall be null and void. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without prior written consent to any Financing Source ( _provided_ that any such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder) pursuant to the terms of the Financing (or any credit agreements, loan documents or indentures of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates) for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning collateral in respect of the Financing. 

  

 Section 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the Transactions, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, shall be governed by, and construed in 

        

accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any conflict of laws provision thereof that would cause the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction.

  

 Section 10.08 Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly, irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party\'s rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 10.08_ in any such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 10.01_. However, nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process on the other party in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) that any Proceeding of any kind or nature, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Preferred Equity Financing or the Transactions, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action or proceeding in any other courts, (iii) that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, and (iv) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court.

EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO

 Section 10.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (which counterparts may be delivered in original, or by electronic transmission in .PDF or similar electronic format or by facsimile), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties here to. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

 Section 10.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 10.13 No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of its or their respective Affiliates or Representatives relating to this Agreement, any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including with respect to the Financing). The Company and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives hereby waive any and all rights or claims and causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter), and each of Company and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives agrees not to commence or support an action against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or 

        

thereby (including any action relating to the Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter). In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Financing Source
shall have any liability for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities,
damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or any of its
Affiliates and its or their respective Representatives in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions. This _Section 10.13_ is intended to
benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company.
