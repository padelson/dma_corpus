deliver to Sapphire a statement with its good faith estimate of the Cash

Amount") and Sapphire shall deliver to Athena a statement with its good faith
estimate of the Cash Consideration Increase Amount (the "Estimated Cash
Consideration Increase Amount"), and in each case, Athena and Sapphire shall
provide the other a reasonable level of supporting documentation for, in the
case of Athena, the Estimated Cash Consideration Decrease Amount and, in the
case of Sapphire, the Estimated Cash Consideration Increase Amount and the
calculation thereof and any related information as reasonably requested by the
other Party. If Athena or Sapphire, as applicable, objects to the Estimated
Cash Consideration Increase Amount or the Estimated Cash Consideration
Decrease Amount or the calculation thereof, Athena or Sapphire, as applicable,
shall deliver a notice of such objection to the other Party no later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and Athena and Sapphire shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in such objection
notice, and Athena or Sapphire, as applicable, shall revise the Estimated Cash
Consideration Decrease Amount or the Estimated Cash Consideration Increase
Amount, as applicable, and the calculation thereof to reflect any revisions
mutually agreed upon by Athena and Sapphire at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date. If Athena and Sapphire fail to resolve any of such
objections, the Estimated Cash Consideration Increase Amount or the Estimated
Cash Consideration Decrease Amount, as applicable, and the calculation thereof
as originally delivered by Athena and Sapphire shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties for the purposes of determining the amount of the Estimated
Adjusted Cash Consideration payable by Sapphire at the Closing.



(d)As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Sapphire shall prepare and cause to be delivered
to Athena a statement with its good faith determination of the Cash
Consideration Increase Amount and the Cash Consideration Decrease Amount,
which statement shall include, in reasonable detail, (i) Sapphire's
calculation of the amounts for each of the adjustments and (i) the calculation
of the Adjusted Cash Consideration (the "Closing Statement"). Sapphire shall
provide a reasonable level of supporting documentation for the Closing
Statement and the Adjusted Cash Consideration therein and the calculation
thereof and any additional information reasonably requested by Athena and
related thereto.



1.Upon receipt of the Closing Statement, Athena and its representatives shall
be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60) day period (the "Review Period")
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to (i) the books and records in the
possession of Sapphire or any of its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) which would reasonably be expected to be necessary for the
preparation of the Closing Statement and (ii) the personnel of Sapphire and
its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) involved in the preparation of
the Closing Statement and/or who would reasonably be expected to be necessary
for the preparation thereof.

2.If Athena disagrees with the Closing Statement or the calculation of the
Adjusted Cash Consideration in the Closing Statement, on or prior to the last
day of the Review Period, Athena shall notify Sapphire in writing of such
disagreement with the Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth any such
disagreement in reasonable detail, the specific item of the Closing Statement
and the calculation thereof to which such disagreement relates and the
specific basis for each such disagreement (the "Objection Notice"). If Athena
fails to deliver the Objection Notice within the Review Period, the Closing Statement and Sapphire's
calculation thereof shall be deemed to have been accepted by Athena and shall
be final and binding. If Athena delivers the Objection Notice within the
Review Period, subject to Section 2.2(g), Athena and Sapphire shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution agreed to
in writing by Athena and Sapphire shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

3.If Athena and Sapphire are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by Section 2.2(f) within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Objection Notice, then Athena and Sapphire shall submit the matter for
resolution to one of the Audit Firms listed in Exhibit 2.2(g) (or, if none of
them is willing or available to accept such engagement, a mutually agreeable
independent international accounting firm), that shall, acting as an expert
(and not as an arbitrator), resolve the dispute set forth in the Objection
Notice. In the event all of the Audit Firms listed in Exhibit 2.2(g) are
unwilling or unavailable to accept such engagement and Athena and Sapphire are
unable to agree on an accounting firm within fifteen (15) days after being
notified by the last one of such Audit Firms that it is unwilling or
unavailable to accept such engagement, at the request of either Party, Athena
and Sapphire shall jointly request that the ICC International Centre for
Expertise appoint an independent international accounting firm to resolve, as
an expert (and not as an arbitrator), the dispute set forth in the Objection
Notice (the accounting firm appointed pursuant to this Section 2.2(g), the
"Independent Auditor"). The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Auditor (and, if applicable, the ICC International Centre for Expertise) shall
be allocated between Athena and Sapphire in proportion to the extent either
Athena or Sapphire did not prevail on the disputed items submitted for the
Independent Auditor's review. For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an
illustration of the methodology set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, if (i) the Objection Notice delivered by Athena assigns values to
the disputed items such that the Adjusted Cash Consideration would be
increased by one million Brazilian Reais (R$ 1,000,000.00), (ii) Sapphire
maintains that the Adjusted Cash Consideration as calculated pursuant to the
Closing Statement is correct and (iii) the Independent Auditor's final
resolution of the disputed items in accordance with this Section 2.2 is that
the Adjusted Cash Consideration as calculated by Sapphire in the Closing
Statement is increased by six hundred thousand Brazilian Reais (R$ 600,000.00)
(i.e., sixty percent (60%) of the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of
Athena), then forty percent (40%) of such fees and expenses of the Independent
Auditor shall be paid by Athena and Sapphire shall be responsible for sixty
percent (60%) of such fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor. All other
costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Independent Auditor shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost and expense.

4.Athena and Sapphire shall instruct the Independent Auditor to consider only
those items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Notice as being
items which Athena and Sapphire are unable to resolve and to make a
determination as to whether such items and amounts were calculated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Further, the Independent
Auditor's determination shall be based solely on the relevant books and
records and the other written information provided by Athena and Sapphire
(i.e., not on the basis of an independent review), and the Independent Auditor
shall not conduct additional discovery in any form. 5.Athena and Sapphire shall jointly instruct the Independent Auditor to make a
determination as soon as practicable (but in any case within thirty (30) days
(or such other time as the Parties shall agree in writing) after its
engagement) with respect to the disputed items submitted to the Independent
Auditor; provided that the failure to adhere to such thirty (30) day time
limit shall not be a basis for challenging the Independent Auditor's
determination. The Independent Auditor shall provide the Parties with a
written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment,
including the basis therefor. Except as may be required by applicable Law or
court order, the Parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects
of any proceeding before the Independent Auditor, including its existence and
results, except that nothing herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing
information regarding such proceeding to a court of competent jurisdiction for
purposes of enforcing this Section 2.2 or the Independent Auditor's final
determination. The Independent Auditor shall be bound by a mutually agreeable
confidentiality agreement, which shall preserve the confidentiality of any
proceeding before the Independent Auditor. The procedures of this Section 2.2
are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the Parties. The decision
rendered pursuant to this Section 2.2(i) may be entered as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Either Athena and Sapphire may seek specific
enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under
this Section 2.2(i). The only defense of either Athena or Sapphire to such a
request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
upon the Independent Auditor or manifest error. Absent such fraud or manifest
error, Athena or Sapphire, as applicable, shall reimburse the Party seeking
enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

(j)If (i) the Estimated Adjusted Cash Consideration exceeds the Adjusted Cash
Consideration as finally determined pursuant to, and in accordance with,
Section 2.2 (the "Final Adjusted Cash Consideration"), Athena shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Sapphire the amount of such excess, and (ii) the Final
Adjusted Cash Consideration exceeds the Estimated Adjusted Cash Consideration,
Sapphire shall pay to Athena the amount of such excess (the excess amounts
referred to in each of clauses (i) and (ii), the "Post-Closing Adjustment
Amounts"). Any Post-Closing Adjustment Amounts shall be paid in cash in
Brazilian Reais by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three
(3) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amounts in accordance with this Section 2.2 to an account or accounts
designated by the Party receiving payment.



a.Merger; Stock Consideration

.

(1)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
immediately following the consummation of the Cash Transfer, on the Closing
Date, NewCo shall be merged with and into Sapphire in accordance with Articles
223, 224, 225 and 227 of the Corporations Law, Articles 1,116, 1,117 and 1,118
of the Brazilian Civil Code, CVM Rule 565 and other applicable Laws. Upon
approval of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of NewCo shall cease,
and all of its rights and obligations shall be transferred to Sapphire, as the
successor and surviving corporation of the Merger. (2)Upon approval of the Merger and subject to Section 2.3(c), (i) each NewCo
Equity Interest outstanding as of immediately prior to the Merger shall be
cancelled and (ii) Sapphire shall issue (in exchange for all cancelled NewCo
Equity Interests) one hundred and one million, one hundred thirty eight
thousand, three hundred and sixty nine (101,138,369) validly issued and
allotted, fully paid-up shares of Sapphire Common Stock (the "Stock
Consideration"). Subject to Section 3.7, the shares of Sapphire Common Stock
to be received as Stock Consideration in the Merger shall (A) have the same
rights as the other shares of Sapphire Common Stock issued and outstanding as
of the Closing Date and (B) be free and clear of any Liens (other than those
set forth in the Organizational Documents of Sapphire or this Agreement or
restrictions on transfer of securities imposed by applicable securities Laws).

(3)The number of shares of Sapphire Common Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration was determined assuming that the total number of outstanding
shares of Sapphire Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis) as of the date of
this Agreement is 128,721,560 (one hundred and twenty eight million, seven
hundred and twenty one thousand, five hundred and sixty), disregarding any
shares held in treasury. During the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing, if there is any change in the total number of outstanding
shares of Sapphire Common Stock resulting from any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, combination (grupamento), subdivision or other
similar transaction (including by means of the issuance of new shares or any
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period), then the Stock
Consideration shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to eliminate the
effect of such event and provide the holders of the Company Equity Interests
the same treatment as contemplated by this Agreement immediately prior to such
event; provided, however, that neither any issuance, sale or other disposition
of shares of Sapphire Common Stock or other Equity Securities of Sapphire
permitted under Section 6.2(b)(i) nor the declaration or payment of the
Excluded Sapphire Dividend shall require or result in any adjustment to the
Stock Consideration as contemplated in this Section 2.3(c) or otherwise.

(4)As a result of, and following the consummation of, the Cash Transfer and
the Merger, (i) Sapphire will become the direct holder of the Purchased
Company Equity Interests and the Remaining Company Equity Interests, which
shall jointly represent, on the Closing Date, one hundred percent (100%) of
the total and voting capital stock of the Company; and (ii) Athena will
receive the Cash Consideration in full and will become the direct holder of
the Stock Consideration, which shall represent, on the Closing Date, forty
four percent (44%) of the total and voting capital stock of Sapphire on a
fully diluted basis; provided that such percentage shall be adjusted downwards
in the event of any issuance, sale or other disposition by Sapphire of shares
of Sapphire Common Stock or other Equity Securities of Sapphire permitted
under Section 6.2(b)(i).

Article III.

and voting capital stock of Sapphire on a fully diluted basis (provided that

or other disposition of shares of Sapphire Common Stock or other Equity

e.Withholding Tax

.

(13)Sapphire shall pay to Athena all amounts due under this Agreement and, to
the extent withholding Taxes apply over such payments, be they in cash or in
kind, such Taxes shall be borne by the applicable responsible party, in
accordance with the applicable Tax Law. Athena shall bear any Brazilian income
tax on capital gain, if any, realized by it in connection with the Cash
Transfer and the Merger. Sapphire is hereby authorized to deduct the amount of
income tax (imposto de renda retido na fonte) from the Adjusted Cash
Consideration. Within thirty (30) days as of the Confirmation Date ("Capital
Gain Methodology Period"), the Parties shall hold good faith discussions to
reach consensus on the methodology applicable to the calculation of such capital gain tax, if any. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Parties will not be required to provide supporting
documentation; however, each Party will be required to provide supporting
documentation during the Capital Gain Methodology Period as reasonably
requested by the other Party. In case the Parties fail to reach consensus
within the Capital Gain Methodology Period, they shall jointly and immediately
engage one of the law firms listed in Exhibit 3.4 to assist in determining the
methodology to calculate the amount of the capital gain, and such law firm
shall deliver a legal opinion containing its view on such methodology, which
shall be binding on the Parties. Upon reaching consensus on the methodology
applicable to the calculation of such capital gain tax or the receipt of the
binding legal opinion, within fifteen (15) days from the definition of the
capital gains methodology, Athena shall inform Sapphire whether it believes
there will be a capital gain in connection with the Cash Transfer and the
Merger and, if so, the amount of such tax. In either case, together with such
communication, Athena shall provide all supporting documents and information
necessary to effectively calculate the capital gain tax to be assessed as a
result of the Cash Transfer and as a result of the Merger.

(14)Following the receipt of such communication and the related supporting
documents and for a period of forty-five (45) days ("Capital Gain Calculation
Period"), the Parties shall hold good faith discussions to reach consensus on
the amount of the capital gain tax to be withheld and Sapphire shall be
entitled to request any additional documents or information reasonably
required for such purpose. In case the Parties fail to reach such consensus
within the Capital Gain Calculation Period, they shall jointly and immediately
engage the same law firm engaged pursuant to Section 3.4(a) (or, if no law
firm was engaged pursuant to Section 3.4(a) or the law firm that was engaged
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) no longer exists, one of the law firms or one of
the other law firms, as applicable, listed in Exhibit 3.4) to calculate the
amount of the capital gain and corresponding tax due, and such law firm shall
deliver a legal opinion containing its view on whether any capital gain tax is
due and, if so, the calculation of such tax, which shall be binding on the
Parties. Once the exact amount of the capital gain and corresponding tax has
been agreed between the Parties, it shall be submitted to the local bank
selected by Sapphire, which bank shall be responsible for remitting the
Adjusted Cash Consideration abroad. In case such bank disagrees with the
calculation of the capital gain due under this Agreement, if any, the Parties
will jointly discuss in good faith and attempt to reach consensus with such
bank, taking all reasonable and necessary steps to resolve any issues with
such bank.

(15)In case there is no capital gain, Sapphire will not withhold any capital
gain Tax. However, in case there is a capital gain, Athena shall provide
Sapphire with all information necessary to collect such tax and complete the
collection document - federal revenue (DARF) corresponding to the deduction of
income tax by Sapphire. Sapphire shall timely remit such tax to the Tax
Authority and shall deliver to Athena proof of payment of the respective
income tax within two (2) Business Days after the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and for the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Tax on Financial
Transactions ("IOF"), if any, levied on an applicable Person with respect to
the Adjusted Cash Consideration shall be borne by the Party in respect of
which the liability for the IOF is imposed under applicable Tax Law, it being
acknowledged that Sapphire is such Party as of the date of this Agreement. f.Filing with the Board of Trade

. Sapphire shall request (or cause the Group Companies to request) the
submission of the relevant corporate acts set forth in Section 3.2 with the
competent Board of Trade within ten (10) days as of the Closing Date, and the
Parties shall cooperate during the registration process so as to provide all
the necessary information or documentation and take any further action that
may be required by such Board of Trade for the registration of said corporate
acts.

Persons are taken together) holding more than twenty percent (20%) of the
Sapphire Common Stock, including any shares of Sapphire Common Stock
underlying any ADSs; provided, however, that nothing in this clause shall

adverse to the Group Companies. If Athena or any of its Affiliates receives
any insurance proceeds after the Closing in respect of any Allowed Insurance
Claims, such proceeds shall be promptly turned over to Sapphire (net of any
reasonable out-of-pocket recovery costs incurred by Athena or any of its
Affiliates in connection therewith); provided, that (w) Sapphire shall

nor the Group Companies shall have any right to, nor shall any of the
foregoing, make claims or seek coverage under any claims-made insurance
policies of Athena or its Affiliates provided by third parties.

(157)From and after the Closing, Sapphire shall cause the Group Companies to
reasonably cooperate with Athena and share such information to the extent
related to Allowed Insurance Claims as is reasonably necessary in the
reasonable view of Athena in order to permit Athena and its Affiliates and
direct and indirect equityholders to manage and conduct their insurance
matters as such Persons deem reasonably appropriate.

adverse impact) on any of the Sapphire Group Companies or any of the Group
Companies, upon prior written notice to Sapphire, which notice will include a
revised Exhibit B setting forth any such change to such actions in reasonable
detail, Athena shall be permitted to consummate the Internal Reorganization in
accordance with the actions set forth in such revised Exhibit B, and the
provisions of this Agreement (and any Exhibit or Schedule hereto) shall apply
mutatis mutandis; (y) if as a result of any change in applicable Law after the
date of this Agreement, the consummation of the Internal Reorganization would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse impact to Athena or any
of its Subsidiaries, Athena shall not be required to consummate the Internal
Reorganization provided in Exhibit B and the provisions of this Agreement (and
any Exhibit or Schedule hereto) shall apply mutatis mutandis with the Company
replacing NewCo for all purposes hereunder and thereunder; and (z) with
respect to step 4 of the Internal Reorganization, Athena shall have absolute
discretion to transfer to Newco any number or percentage of the Company Equity
Interests, and Athena shall provide a revised Exhibit B reflecting this choice, and the provisions of this Agreement
(and any Exhibit or Schedule hereto) shall apply mutatis mutandis (with the
applicable number or percentage of Newco Equity Interests replacing Purchased
Company Equity Interests in respect of the Cash Transfer, and the applicable
number or percentage of NewCo Equity Interests to ultimately be exchanged for
Sapphire Equity Interests in the Merger to be adjusted accordingly) for all
purposes hereunder and thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event

lxxxiv.No Indemnified Party may be indemnified for any Loss under this

indemnifying Person (the "Indemnifying Party") by giving reasonably prompt
written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, the
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the indemnification claim
in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of

investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Indemnified Party's and its Affiliates' premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the

determines is competitively sensitive information restricted from disclosure
under applicable Law or Order, (B) is subject to the attorney-client privilege
or other similar privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, (C) is
subject to any obligations of confidentiality which prohibit the disclosure of
such information to the Indemnifying Party or its Representatives, or (D) the
disclosure of which would otherwise violate any Law or Order applicable to, or
Contract (in existence on the date hereof and set forth on the Athena
Disclosure Schedule or the Sapphire Disclosure Schedule, as applicable) of,
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond in writing to such indemnification claim accepting or rejecting
such indemnification claim within such thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue a claim pursuant to Section (184)Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such agreement or
final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Parties agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full
payment of any such obligations within such fifteen (15) Business Day period,
any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of such
agreement or such final, non-appealable adjudication to but excluding the date

by the Parties as an adjustment to the purchase price payable under this
Agreement for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto shall not be affected or
deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of
the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or
should have known that any such covenant or agreement is, was or might be
breached or non-fulfilled or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of
any condition set forth in Article VII.

(187)From and after the Closing, Athena and its Affiliates shall not have, and
shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, reimbursement, subrogation or indemnity against any of the Group
Companies in connection with any indemnification obligation to which Athena
may become subject pursuant to this Agreement. From and after the Closing
Date, Athena hereby irrevocably waives and releases (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates) each of the Group Companies from any such right of
contribution, reimbursement, subrogation or indemnity.

consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind or nature,
including damages determined as diminution in value or as multiple of earnings

under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable, which actions include (i) cooperating in determining which
filings, notices, statements, submissions of information or applications are
required or advisable to obtain the consent, authorization, order, license,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) furnishing all information
and documents required by applicable Law in connection with approvals of, or
filings with, any Governmental Antitrust Authority, (iii) filing or
submitting, or causing to be filed or submitted, as promptly as practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any documentation or
information that is required, proper or advisable to obtain the consent,
authorization, order, license, registration, permit, variance or approval of,
or any exemption, clearance, action, non-action, waiver or exemption by, any
Governmental Antitrust Authorities, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain as promptly as practicable the CADE Clearance under applicable Law, (v)
resolving, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any objections as may be
asserted by any Governmental Antitrust Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) taking such actions as are necessary to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as
reasonably practicable (provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to obligate any Party to waive any such conditions), and (vii)
cooperating to the extent reasonable with the other parties hereto in their
respective efforts to comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of Athena and Sapphire shall use reasonable best efforts to
file with CADE any required notification and report forms required to be filed
with CADE under the applicable Law as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, but in any event the pre-filing shall be made no later
than the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement.
Subject to Sapphire's compliance with its obligations under this Section 9.1,
Sapphire shall, on behalf of the Parties, control and lead all communications
and strategy relating to CADE, after consulting and cooperating with and
considering in good faith the views of Athena with respect thereto.

(190)In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in
Section 9.1(a), each of Athena and Sapphire shall furnish to the other, and
Athena shall cause the Group Companies to furnish to Sapphire, such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under applicable Law, including any
antitrust merger control Laws, and permit the other Party to review any filing
or submission prior to forwarding to the CADE and other Governmental Antitrust
Authorities and accept any reasonable comments made by that other Party (it
being acknowledged that certain such drafts or documents may be shared in
redacted form or on a confidential outside counsel-to-counsel only basis).
Athena and Sapphire shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Antitrust Authorities and shall comply as promptly as
practicable with any such inquiry or request. Each of Athena and Sapphire
agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Antitrust Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Antitrust Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate. Sapphire shall lead the filing process and be
responsible for the payment of the one-time filing fee to the applicable
Governmental Antitrust Authorities in connection with the submission.

(191)Each of Sapphire and Athena agrees to take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate any impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority so as to enable the Parties to expeditiously close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including proposing, negotiating
and consenting to any hold separate order, divestiture, licensing or other
disposition or other structural or conduct relief, in each case, with respect
to the Sapphire Group Companies or the Group Companies, in order to obtain
clearance from any Governmental Antitrust Authority; provided, that, the
effectiveness of any such hold separate order, divestiture, licensing or other
disposition or other structural or conduct relief shall be contingent on the
consummation of the Cash Transfer and the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations of this Section 9.1(c) shall not apply to Sapphire
or Athena to the extent compliance with this Section 9.1(c) would have a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Sapphire Group Companies and the Group Companies, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to the Cash Transfer and the Merger (such material
adverse effect, a "Substantial Detriment"). For purposes of this Section
9.1(c), Substantial Detriment shall mean any hold separate order, divestiture,
licensing or other disposition or other structural or conduct relief which
involves assets or rights representing, in the aggregate, more than twenty
percent (20%) of the combined aggregate gross revenues of the Sapphire Group
Companies and the Group Companies for the 12-month period ended December 31,
2019.

Sapphire MandA Transactions, each Party shall not, and each Party shall cause
its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire by
merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of any Person or
other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
increase the risk of conditions being imposed on (even if such conditions do
not amount to a Substantial Detriment) or of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Antitrust Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) cause any Governmental
Antitrust Authority to enter into an order prohibiting or imposing conditions
on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (even if such conditions do
not amount to a Substantial Detriment), or (iii) prevent it from being able to
remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.

any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any of the Equity Interests, assets

Members, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), for
any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, consents, approvals,
terminations, accelerations, cancellations, losses of benefits or Liens that

arrangement or understanding with respect to the Transfer of, any Shareholder

. This Agreement and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether contractual or
extracontractual, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of Brazil.

o.Arbitration

.

(199)All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be
finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce ("Rules") by three arbitrators. The claimant(s) shall nominate one
arbitrator in the request for arbitration. The respondent(s) shall nominate
one arbitrator in the answer to the request. The two party-nominated
arbitrators shall then have thirty (30) days to agree, in consultation with
the parties to the arbitration, upon the nomination of a third arbitrator to
act as president of the tribunal, barring which the International Court of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce shall select the third
arbitrator (or any arbitrator that claimant(s) or respondent(s) shall fail to
nominate in accordance with the foregoing). The place of arbitration shall be
the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The arbitration award shall be issued in Sao
Paulo, Brazil. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The law
governing this arbitration agreement shall be the Laws of Brazil.

(200)The tribunal shall be empowered to resolve any and all controversies
relating to any dispute, including ancillary matters, and shall be empowered
to issue any necessary orders to the Parties, including injunctions and
intermediate orders prior to a final decision. The arbitrators shall not make
decisions on the basis of equity. (201)The arbitration award may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction over the Parties, their assets or to the courts of the city of
Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, at the parties' sole discretion. The
arbitral award shall be final and binding to the parties of the arbitration
proceeding and to their successors and assigns, and the Parties waive any
right to appeal. The arbitral award, partial or final, shall, in addition to
the requirements provided in the Rules, fully comply with the requirements of
Article 489 and its paragraphs, of the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure. The
appointed arbitrators shall expressly confirm, in their independence and
impartiality questionnaires, that they will adhere to this procedural
provision and the absence of such confirmation will constitute cause for
refusal, by any of the parties, to the appointment of the arbitrator.

(202)Each Party retains the right to seek judicial assistance: (a) to compel
arbitration; (b) to obtain interim measures for protection of rights prior to
the institution of arbitration, which may be upheld, overturned or modified by
the arbitration tribunal, after its constitution; (c) to enforce any decision
of the arbitration tribunal, including the arbitral award and any enforceable
obligation; and (d) to seek annulment of the arbitration award when permitted
by Law; which the Parties, at their own discretion, may request to any court
having jurisdiction over the Parties or their assets or to the court of the
city of Sao Paulo, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. No judicial measure shall be
construed as a waiver of arbitration as the exclusive means of dispute
resolution selected by the Parties or to the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.

(203)If the Rules are silent on any procedural aspect, they shall be
supplemented by the relevant provisions of Brazil's Law No. 9,307 of September
23, 1996, as amended, supplemented or substituted from time to time.

(204)Arbitration Costs. During the course of the arbitration, the Parties
shall bear their own expenses, costs and fees of their attorneys,
Representatives and technical assistants. At the end of the arbitration, the
arbitration panel shall establish in the arbitration award the criteria for
the reimbursement of such expenses, costs and legal fees in favor of the Party
that prevails, always in the proportion that such Party prevailed.

(205)Confidentiality. The Parties agree that the existence, contents and
result of the arbitration shall be always kept confidential during its entire
course and also after it is concluded. All elements of the arbitration
(including the arguments of the parties, evidence, reports, decisions, third
party statements and any documents submitted or exchanged within the
proceeding) may only be disclosed to the arbitration panel, to the parties,
their attorneys, technical assistants and to persons necessarily bound to the
arbitration proceeding, except if the disclosure is required for the
compliance of the obligations imposed by applicable Law. However, a violation
of this covenant shall not affect the enforceability of this Agreement to
arbitration or the arbitrators' award. Violation of confidentiality shall be
subject to an expedited judicial collection proceeding pursuant to Brazilian
Law (Execuçao Judicial).

(206)The Parties' obligations under this arbitration provision shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this section shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the Parties' obligation to submit their claims to binding arbitration or the
other provisions of this section. p.Notices

. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally by hand or by
overnight courier or other delivery method or when sent by electronic mail
transmission (provided that, in the case of electronic mail transmission,

indirectly, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party, and any purported assignment or delegation in contravention of this
Section 12.8 shall be null and void and of no force and effect; provided,
however, that Athena shall be permitted to assign, without the prior written

without the consent of any Person other than the Parties.

t.Severability

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to

EXHIBIT 6.34



SELECT TERMS FOR REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT1



| | | | | 
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
Parties:|

Sapphire agrees to enter into a registration rights agreement substantially
consistent with the terms set forth in this Exhibit 6.34 on the Closing Date
with (i) Athena and (ii) Wengen Alberta, Limited Partnership ("Wengen").


 

Registrable Securities:|

"Registrable Securities" shall mean any shares of Sapphire Common Stock and
Sapphire ADSs held by the parties to the Registration Rights Agreement
received pursuant to (i) the Closing, (ii) any dividend, distribution or
otherwise from Athena (including through the Exchange Offer) or (iii) a
distribution or otherwise from Wengen, including any other securities issued
or issuable with respect to any of the shares of Sapphire Common Stock or
Sapphire ADSs described in clauses (i) through (iii) above in connection with
a stock dividend, stock split or distribution, combination of shares, or in
connection with a merger, consolidation, reclassification, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar transaction; provided, that any such
securities will cease to constitute "Registrable Securities" upon the earlier
to occur of: (A) the date on which such securities are disposed of by such
holder; and (B) the date on which such securities cease to be outstanding.


 

Initial F-3 Registration:|

So long as Registrable Securities remain outstanding, once Sapphire is
eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-3, which shall be an
automatically effective registration statement if available (the "Initial F-3
Registration"), Sapphire will use commercially reasonable efforts to
effectuate such Initial F-3 Registration on behalf of any holders of
Registrable Securities which elect to have their securities included therein
in accordance with customary terms to be mutually agreed.


 

Demand Registrations:|

Subject to the breathing period referred to below and the termination of
registration rights described below, (i) prior to the first distribution of
any Registrable Securities by Athena to its stockholders, whether through the
Exchange Offer or otherwise (the "First Distribution"), Athena shall be
entitled to demand that Sapphire put up a shelf registration statement (if the
Initial F-3 Registration has not occurred or is no longer effective) and
thereafter effectuate one or more takedowns off of such shelf (which may be
"block trades"), or, if a shelf is not available, effectuate one or more
stand-alone registered offerings (which, in each case, may be underwritten);
and (ii) after the First Distribution, any holder or group of holders
collectively holding 5% or more of the then outstanding Registrable Securities
shall be entitled to make such demands; provided, that such stand-alone non-
shelf registrations or shelf take-downs may not be requested more than (A) (1)
three times by Athena prior to the First Distribution and (2) two times by
Athena after the First Distribution and (B) two times by Wengen after the
First Distribution, and, in each case, such stand-alone non-shelf
registrations or shelf take-downs shall include shares of Sapphire Common
Stock or Sapphire ADSs having an aggregate market value of at least US$75
million (or the full amount of such party's holdings of Registrable Securities
if less than US$75 million). In the event that Wengen has dissolved or
otherwise distributed Registrable Securities to its equityholders prior to its
exercise of all of its demand registration rights pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, Wengen's equityholders will be permitted to appoint a
representative to exercise any unused demands for registration that could have
been exercised by Wengen, so long as such representative executes and delivers
a written joinder agreement to Sapphire pursuant to which representative
agrees to become party to the Registration Rights Agreement and agrees to be
bound thereby. The filing of a shelf registration statement absent an
accompanying offering by a holder of Registrable Securities will not count
toward the permitted number of demands for any holder of Registrable
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sapphire will not be obligated to
effectuate more than: (X) two shelf takedowns or stand-alone offerings of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement in any 12
month period; and (Y) three shelf takedowns or stand-alone offerings of
Registrable Securities prior to the First Distribution. Under no circumstances
shall Sapphire be obligated to effectuate more than an aggregate of four
offerings of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement (such offerings to be allocated between Athena and Wengen (or
Wengen's equityholders, as the case may be) as shall be mutually agreed
between them).



Subject to customary blackouts referred to below, Sapphire shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any shelf
registration statement continuously until the earliest of (i) 150 days, (ii)
the day after the date on which all of the Registrable Securities covered by
such shelf registration statement have been sold pursuant thereto and (iii)
the first date on which there shall cease to be any Registrable Securities
covered by such shelf registration statement outstanding.



Regarding cutbacks, all holders of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to
participate in any such demand registration/takedown on a pro rata basis and
shall have priority over any shares sought to be sold by Sapphire or any other
person not party to the Registration Rights Agreement in any such
registration/takedown.



There shall be at least a 180-day "breathing period" between the completion of
any of the shelf and/or other demand registrations referred to above and any
request for any such subsequent registration hereunder.


 

Piggyback Rights:|

Holders of Registrable Securities shall be entitled to piggyback onto any
registration/shelf takedown by Sapphire of the Sapphire Common Stock or
Sapphire ADSs for its own account or for the account of any other holders
(including holders of any Registrable Securities). Sapphire shall have
priority in any registration it has initiated for its own account, and the
holders of Registrable Securities collectively shall have parity with any
other holder participating in such registration and with any other holders
participating in any other registration (other than pursuant to a demand made
hereunder) initiated for the account of any holder pursuant to contractual
registration rights. Any cutback required with respect to the holders of
Registrable Securities, together with any other holders having parity, shall
be done on a pro rata basis based upon the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration/takedown (and any such other
holder's securities).


 

Selection of Underwriters:|

In the event the offering is to be underwritten, (i) if a majority of the
securities to be sold in such offering is being sold by Sapphire for its own
account, Sapphire shall have the right to select the underwriter(s) and (ii)
otherwise, the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such offering shall have the right to select the
underwriters with the consent of Sapphire, not to be unreasonably withheld,
provided that Sapphire shall have the right to veto any such underwriter
selected by the majority of Registrable Securities (other than an underwriter
selected in connection with a block trade) if Sapphire concludes, in its sole
discretion, that such underwriter has any conflicts of interest with regard to
Sapphire.


 

Blackouts:|

Sapphire shall have a customary right (such right to be mutually agreed) to
suspend, at any time (but not more than once in any twelve-month period) the
registration process and/or suspend a holder's ability to use a prospectus if
Sapphire believes, in the good faith judgment of the Sapphire Board, that (i)
the continuation of the registration process thereof at the time requested
would adversely affect a pending or proposed significant corporate event, or
negotiations, discussions or pending proposals with respect thereto; or (ii)
would require the disclosure of material non-public information.



The filing of a registration statement (or amendment or supplement thereto) by
Sapphire cannot be deferred, and the holder's rights to make sales cannot be
suspended, pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph
(x) in the case of clause (i) above, for more than thirty days after the
abandonment or consummation of any of the proposals or transactions set forth
in such clause (i); (y) in the case of clause (ii), until the date upon which
such information otherwise has been disclosed by Sapphire; or (z) in any
event, in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii) above, for more than 90
days after the date of the Board's determination; provided that Sapphire may
not suspend any holder's ability to use a prospectus for more than an
aggregate of 90 days in any 365-day period. In addition, Sapphire shall have
the right to suspend the registration process and/or any holder's ability to
use a prospectus during each of its regular quarterly blackout periods
applicable to directors and officers under Sapphire's policies in existence
from time to time.


 

Lock-Ups:|

In connection with an underwritten offering, Sapphire (including its officers
and directors) and any holder of Registrable Securities participating in such
offering (or given an opportunity to participate in such offering) shall be
subject to customary lock-up arrangements as may be reasonably requested by
the lead underwriter selected for the offering.


 

Expenses:|

Prior to the First Distribution, in connection with any offering pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement, (i) Athena shall pay all fees and expenses
of its outside counsel, (ii) Athena and Sapphire shall share equally SEC
registration fees and (iii) Sapphire shall pay any other transaction-related
costs (e.g., fees relating to Sapphire's counsel, auditor comfort letters,
printer fees, etc.). After the First Distribution, Sapphire and Athena shall
share equally all costs and expenses associated with each SEC registration and
offering, including the reasonable fees and expenses of one firm of attorneys
selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities covered by
such registration with the consent of Sapphire, not to be unreasonably
withheld. Holders of Registrable Securities will pay underwriting discounts
and commissions (and any applicable taxes) on any Registrable Securities sold
by them pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities sold by them.


 

Termination of Registration Rights:|

Sapphire's obligation to register Registrable Securities for each party to the
Registration Rights Agreement will terminate on the earliest to occur of: (A)
the third anniversary of the Closing, (B) the date on which such party has
disposed of all of its Registrable Securities and (C) the date on which all
demand rights permitted by the Registration Rights Agreement have been
exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of the registration
rights of one holder of Registrable Securities pursuant to clause (B) above
will not affect the registration rights of any other party to the Registration
Rights Agreement, and the provisions described under "Expenses" above and
"Indemnification" below shall survive any such termination. A holder of
Registrable Securities may irrevocably waive its registration rights and be
released from its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement.


 

Indemnification:| The Registration Rights Agreement shall include customary
indemnification provisions for U.S. securities offerings.
