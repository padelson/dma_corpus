Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a)&nbsp;each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response
to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in the Purchaser SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); and (b)&nbsp;a
Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such

Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser, dated July 2, 2020 (the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-weight: normal"><U>Prospectus</U></FONT>&rdquo;).
The Company acknowledges that it has been advised by the Purchaser that, as described in the Prospectus, the Purchaser has established
the Trust Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of the Purchaser and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the
Trust Agreement and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Purchaser
may disburse monies from the Trust Account only (i)&nbsp;if the Purchaser completes the transactions which constitute a Business
Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in the Prospectus; (ii)&nbsp;if the Purchaser fails to complete
a Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Purchaser&rsquo;s
public stockholders; and (iii)&nbsp;if the Purchaser holds a shareholder vote to amend the Purchaser&rsquo;s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to redeem one-hundred percent (100%) of the Purchaser
Common Stock if the Purchaser fails to complete a Business Combination within the allotted time period, then for the redemption
of any Purchaser Common Stock properly tendered in connection with such vote. For and in consideration of the Purchaser agreeing
to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind
in or to any monies in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim
it may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the Purchaser. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company&rsquo;s right to pursue a claim against the Purchaser
for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.16</U> hereof (including a claim for the
Purchaser to specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining
in the Trust Account after giving effect to the redemption of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Redemptions in
connection with the Closing) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, or for fraud and (y) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company may have in the future against the Purchaser&rsquo;s assets
or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account to the Purchaser
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds). This <U>Section&nbsp;11.13</U> shall survive termination
of this Agreement for any reason.</P>

of meeting of stockholders; (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof; or (iii)
by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different,
on whose behalf such business is proposed or such nomination or nominations are made, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial
owner of shares of the corporation) at the time of giving the stockholder&rsquo;s notice provided for in Section 5(b) below, who
is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5. For the avoidance

an independent director of the corporation (as such term is used in any applicable stock exchange listing requirements or applicable
law) or on any committee or sub-committee of the Board of Directors under any applicable stock exchange listing requirements or
applicable law, or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder&rsquo;s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof,

of a stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election
at the annual meeting on behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of directors to be elected at such annual

</B>Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive
officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual rights, shall vest when the person becomes a director or executive
officer of the corporation, shall continue as vested contract rights even if such person ceases to be a director or executive
officer of the corporation, and shall be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation
and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or executive
officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i)&nbsp;the
claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii)&nbsp;no disposition of such claim is made within
90 days of request therefor. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful
in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for
indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the
claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel
or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other
applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create
a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or executive
officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 46 or otherwise shall be on
the corporation.</FONT></P>

of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action
which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and
