Article III _ 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  



  

3.1 _Conversion of Securities; Assumption of Company Options_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities:

  



  

(i) each share of Company Class A Common Stock and each share of Company
Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
number of shares of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio;

  



    

24

 



    



  

(ii) each share of Company Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the number of shares of the Purchaser Class B Common
Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio;

  



  

(iii) any shares of Company Capital Stock held in the treasury of the Company
or owned by the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an " _Excluded Share_ ") shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto;

  



  

(iv) each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence; and

  



  

(v) each option to purchase Company Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Company
Option_ ") that is outstanding under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan
immediately prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, shall
be assumed by the Purchaser and converted into an option to purchase shares
of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock (each, a " _Converted Option_ ") equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (a) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of the Purchaser Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the Converted Options shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Converted Option to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of the Purchaser Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments in a
manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1, such that the
Converted Option will not constitute a modification of such Company
Option for purposes of Section 409A or Section 424 of the Code. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Converted
Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions
(including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the
corresponding former Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options pursuant to
this subsection.

  



  

(b) For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of shares of the
Purchaser Class A Common Stock or the Purchaser Class B Common Stock, as the
case may be, issuable to each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.1_ , all shares of Company Class A
Common Stock, Company Class B Company Stock and all shares of Company Series A
Preferred Stock held by such holder shall be aggregated amongst themselves,
and the aggregate number of shares of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock or
the Purchaser Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, to be issued in
respect of such aggregate number of shares held by such holder shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

  



    

25

Company under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan in respect of Company Options,
and shall, subject to and in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(v)_ , assume such

awards. The Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of the Purchaser
Class A Common Stock for delivery upon settlement of the assumed Company
Options in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)(v)_. Once permitted by applicable
Law, the Purchaser shall file or otherwise have available a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of the Purchaser Class A
Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Options to the extent available
for registration on Form S-8.

  



  

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be

Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ of
this Agreement and (ii) for the benefit of the holders of Company Class B
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , the number
of shares of the Purchaser Class B Common Stock sufficient to deliver the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto

Purchaser Class A Common Stock and the Purchaser Class B Common Stock, in
each case referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Purchaser

Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All shares deposited hereunder
shall not be certificated.

  



    

26

 



    



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of Company Capital Stock evidenced by certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ : a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and shall specify (a) that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or
confirmation of cancellation of such Certificates from the Company's
transfer agent, eShares, Inc. (DBA Carta, Inc.) (each, a " _Transfer Agent
Cancellation_ "); and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal. Within two (2)
Business Days (but in no event prior to the Effective Time) after the
surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates held by such holder for
cancellation (or a Transfer Agent Cancellation), together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore, and the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.1_
, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate entitled
to receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.1_ shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.1_.

  



  

(ii) Within two (2) Business Days following receipt of a completed Letter of
Transmittal (but in no event prior to the Effective Time), the Purchaser
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of Company Capital
Stock, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented by book-
entry the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 3.1_ , and such Company Capital Stock shall forthwith be cancelled.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of the Purchaser
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of the Purchaser Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_. Subject to the effect
of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pay
or cause to be paid to the holder of shares of the Purchaser Common Stock
issued in exchange therefore, without interest, (i) promptly, but in any
event within five (5) Business Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of the Purchaser Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such shares of the Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Series A
Preferred Stock_. The Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon conversion
of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Capital Stock.

  



    

27

 



    



  

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Merger Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock or the Purchaser
Preferred Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time (but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be adjusted to
reflect any change in the capitalization of the Company, except to the extent
expressly set forth in the definition of "Exchange Ratio" and its
components).

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock for one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Purchaser, upon
demand, and any holders of Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 3.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Purchaser
for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Capital Stock as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Purchaser free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Capital Stock
for any such Company Capital Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with this _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Capital Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. Each of the Surviving Corporation and the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any
holder of Company Capital Stock to reduce or eliminate such deduction and
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Purchaser, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Capital Stock (or intended recipients of compensatory
payments) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser, as the case may be.

  



  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and related indemnity
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (such
affidavit and indemnity to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation but in any case to not require
the delivery of a bond), the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration that such holder is otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the provisions of _Section 3.1_.

  



    

28

 



    



  

3.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Capital Stock,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Purchaser for any reason shall be converted into the applicable Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Section
3.1_.

  



  

3.4 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Series A Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by Stockholders who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common
Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL
relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights shall not
be converted into, and such stockholders shall have no right to receive, the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who
fails to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or
its rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Series A Preferred Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in this _Article III_ , of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A
Preferred Stock (as the case may be).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give the Purchaser (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any
withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

Law and, to the knowledge of the Company, there does not exist any basis
therefor. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Transactions will
not result in the violation of any (i) Data Protection Law or (ii) the

in that jurisdiction.

of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Purchaser under any material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement
and, as of the date hereof, the Purchaser has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any term
or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription

stockholders required by and in compliance with all applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The Purchaser shall not adjourn or

of Company; _provided_ that the Purchaser may adjourn or postpone the
Purchaser Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any

reasonably determines (following consultation with Company, except with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal) is necessary to comply with applicable
Laws, is provided to the Purchaser's stockholders in advance of a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement, (ii) if, as of the time that the
Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of the Purchaser Common Stock represented at such meeting (either in

of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting or (iii) if, as of the time that the
Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled, adjournment or
postponement of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is necessary to enable the

Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that the Purchaser may postpone or adjourn
on one (1) occasion so long as the date of the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15 consecutive

that the Purchaser Board has unanimously recommended that the Purchaser's

(including this _Section 8.3_ ) shall require the Company to use efforts to
cause, or attempt to cause, any purchase of any Purchaser Class A Common Stock
pursuant to the terms of any Subscription Agreement.

  



  

8.4 _Company Stockholder Approval_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with _Article 9.3(g)_ , upon the terms set forth in this
Agreement, the Company shall seek the irrevocable written consent, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, of Stockholders sufficient
to approve the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other

cause their respective representatives to hold in strict confidence, unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other

the Transactions (except to the extent that such information can be shown to
have been (a) previously known by the Party to which it was furnished, (b) in
the public domain through no fault of such Party or (c) later lawfully
acquired from other sources on a non-confidential basis, which source is not
the agent of the other Party, by the Party to which it was furnished,
without any breach by such source of any obligation of confidentiality to the
other Party), and each Party shall not release or disclose such information
to any other person, except its representatives in connection with this
Agreement. In the event that any Party believes that it is required to
disclose any such confidential information pursuant to applicable Laws, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, such Party shall give timely written
notice to the other Party (which, for clarity, shall in the case of
the Company be to the Purchaser and in the case of the Purchaser be to the
Company) so that such Party may have an opportunity to obtain a protective
order or other appropriate relief, and such Party shall only disclose the
minimum amount of such confidential information so required to be disclosed.
The Parties acknowledge that some previously confidential information will be
required by applicable Law to be disclosed in the Registration Statement. The

Date, the Company shall enter into a directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy covering the current and former directors, officers and
employees, as the case may be, of the Company (the "Company _Insured Parties_

maintained by the Company covering the Insured Parties as of the date of this
Agreement (such policy, a " _Company D andO Policy_"), for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date. All costs and expenses related to the

and officers' liability insurance policy covering the current and former
directors, officers and employees, as the case may be, of the Purchaser (the

to the Purchaser Insured Parties than those of any directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Purchaser covering the
Purchaser Insured Parties as of the date of this Agreement (such policy, a "
_Purchaser D andO Policy_"), for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date. All costs and expenses related to the Purchaser DandO Policy, including

or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, the Purchaser shall cause proper provisions to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.7_.

  



  

(d) The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this _Section
8.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any indemnitee and/or Insured Party to whom this _Section 8.7_

Company Charter Documents or the comparable charter or organizational
documents of any member of the Company Group, or any other indemnification
arrangement or otherwise.

  



  

(f) On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Company with the
directors and officers of the Purchaser individuals set forth on _Schedule
8.7(f)_ (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "), which indemnification
agreements shall continue to be effective following the Closing.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

8.8 _PIPE Investment_. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company,
the Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made
to, any waiver (in whole or in part) or provide consent to (including consent
to termination), of any provision or remedy under, or any replacements of,
any of the Subscription Agreements (which consent or approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Purchaser shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Subscription Agreements on the terms and conditions described therein,
including maintaining in effect the Subscription Agreements and to: (a)
satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions and
covenants applicable to the Purchaser in the Subscription Agreements and
otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder; (b) in the event that all
conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than conditions that the

Agreements at or prior to Closing; (c) confer with the Company regarding

Subscription Agreements (other than conditions that the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates control the satisfaction of and other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied,
to cause the applicable PIPE Investors to pay to (or as directed by) the
Purchaser the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount, as applicable,
set forth in the Subscription Agreements in accordance with their terms.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give the
Company, prompt written notice: (a) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Subscription Agreement
known to the Purchaser; (b) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any party to any Subscription Agreement with
respect to any actual, potential, threatened or claimed expiration, lapse,
withdrawal, breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of any Subscription Agreement;
and (c) if the Purchaser does not expect to receive all or any portion of the
PIPE Investment Amount on the terms, in the manner or from the PIPE Investors
as contemplated by the Subscription Agreements. The Purchaser shall deliver
all notices it is required to deliver under the Subscription Agreements on a
timely basis in order to cause the PIPE Investors to consummate the PIPE
Investment concurrently with the Closing and shall take all actions required
under any Subscription Agreements with respect to the timely issuance and
delivery of any physical certificates evidencing the shares of the Purchaser
Class A Common Stock as and when required under any such Subscription
Agreements.

  



  

8.9 _Additional Purchase Right_. In the event that at Closing the Available
Closing Purchaser Cash would not be sufficient to satisfy the condition in

not the obligation) to purchase immediately prior to the Closing additional
shares of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock, valued at $10.00 per share for
such purpose up to the amount of such deficiency subject to, substantially
the same terms and conditions set forth in the Subscription Agreements.

plan that provides for grant of awards to employees and other service
providers of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, with a total pool
of awards of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock not exceeding eighteen and
one half percent (18.5)% of the Fully-Diluted Purchaser Common Stock
immediately following the Closing (inclusive of the shares available for
issuance under such plan), with an annual "evergreen" increase of not more
than four percent (4%) of the Fully-Diluted Purchaser Common Stock outstanding
as of the day prior to such increase (inclusive of the shares available for
issuance under such plan) in a form otherwise mutually agreed by Purchaser and
the Company (the " _Equity Incentive Plan_ ") and (b) an employee stock
purchase plan, that provides for grant of purchase rights with respect to the
Purchaser Class A Common Stock to employees of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, with a total pool of shares of the Purchaser Class A Common
Stock not exceeding two percent (2%) of the Fully-Diluted Purchaser
Common Stock immediately following the Closing (inclusive of the shares
available for issuance under the plan), with an annual "evergreen" increase
of one percent (1%) of the Fully-Diluted Purchaser Common Stok outstanding as
of the day prior to such increase (inclusive of the shares available for
issuance under the plan), in a form otherwise mutually agreed by Purchaser and
the Company (the " _Purchase Plan_ "). " _Fully-Diluted Purchaser Common
Stock_ " means the aggregate number of (i) shares of Purchaser Class A Common
Stock, (ii) shares of Purchaser Class B Common Stock, and (iii) securities
convertible into or exercisable for Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

8.11 _Continuing Employees_.

  



  

(a) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under any Plan of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, solely to the extent such Plan provides benefits
to any Continuing Employee after the Closing Date (including the Company
Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each such Continuing Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ that the foregoing service credit shall not be
required to apply (i) to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (ii) for
purposes of any defined benefit pension accrual under any New Plan and (iii)
for purposes of any subsidy provided for any post-employment welfare benefits
under any New Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall,
or shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions
were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) any eligible expenses incurred
by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

undertaking to amend, any Company Plan or any other Plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. The provisions of this _Section 8.11_ are solely for the
benefit of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 8.11_ , express or

any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind

(a) In the event that the Closing of the Transactions has not occurred by
April 18, 2021 (the " _Outside Closing Date_ "), the Purchaser or the Company
shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Agreement;
provided, however, that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(a)_ if the failure of the Closing
to occur prior to the Outside Closing Date is attributable to the failure on
the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such Party. Such
right may be exercised by the Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be,
giving written notice to the other at any time after the Outside Closing Date;

Stockholder Approval at the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting (subject to any

the Purchaser or the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to
terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Party; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

Approval within five (5) Business Days after the Registration Statement has
been declared effective by the SEC and delivered or otherwise made available

be satisfied and cannot be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date
and thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company of a written notice
describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach; provided that

Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.2(a)_ until
the earlier of: (i) thirty (30) days after delivery of such written notice to
the Company and (ii) the Outside Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.2(a)_ if the Purchaser is then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant that would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ or _Section

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date
by giving written notice to the Purchaser, without prejudice to any rights or
obligations the Company may have, if the Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have

scheduled to occur on such date or if such breach by the Purchaser or Merger
Sub is cured during such thirty (30) day period.

11.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies._

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
Party; _provided_ _,_ _however_ that after any such adoption of this Agreement
by Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which Law
requires further approval of the Stockholders without the further approval of
such Stockholders, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No
provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the Party
against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply
only in the particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of dealing
shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any Party from enforcing any right or
remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to or
demand on a Party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that Party or
impairs any right of the Party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise
required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with respect
to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other right or
remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved Party whole with respect to such
breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to any
other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any Party
seek, nor shall any Party be liable for, diminution in value, punitive,
consequential, special, indirect, or exemplary damages, under any tort,
contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach (or
alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

11.3 _Arm 's Length Bargaining; No Presumption Against Drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by Parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the Parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any Party in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made
based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

11.4 _Publicity_. The Parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall
issue any press release or make any other public disclosure concerning the
Transactions without the prior approval of the other Party (which, for
clarity, shall in the case of the Company be from the Purchaser and in the
case of the Purchaser and Merger Sub be from the Company). If a Party is
required to make such a disclosure as required by law, the Parties will use
their best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or public disclosure
to be issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in the
Purchaser SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); and (b)
a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party but subject to
giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement or statement as may be required by any Law.

  



  

11.5 _Expenses_. The costs and expenses incurred by the Company and the
Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions,
including any Transaction Expenses and the Deferred Underwriting Amount,
shall be paid by the Purchaser at the Closing; provided, for the avoidance of
doubt, that if the Closing does not take place, each Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

  



  

11.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No Party may assign any right or delegate
any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation, operation of
law, or otherwise, without the written consent of the other Party (which, for
clarity, shall in the case of the Company be from the Purchaser and in the
case of the Purchaser and Merger Sub be from the Company). Any purported
assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in addition to
constituting a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof.

  



  

11.8 _Counterparts; Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one (1) agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
upon delivery to each Party of an executed counterpart or the earlier
delivery to each Party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted
signature pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures
of all other Parties.

  



  

11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Additional
Agreements, including the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto, sets
forth the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related to the subject matter
hereof and thereto (whether written or oral), all of which are merged herein.
Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there
is no condition precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof or
thereof. No Party has relied on any representation from, or warranty or
agreement of, any person in entering into this Agreement, prior hereto or
contemporaneous herewith or any Additional Agreement, except those expressly
stated herein or therein.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

11.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid

11.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 8.7 _and

11.13 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser,
dated July 2, 2020 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company acknowledges that it
has been advised by the Purchaser that, as described in the Prospectus, the
Purchaser has established the Trust Account for the benefit of the public
stockholders of the Purchaser and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to
the Trust Agreement and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Purchaser may disburse monies from
the Trust Account only (i) if the Purchaser completes the transactions which
constitute a Business Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts
as described in the Prospectus; (ii) if the Purchaser fails to complete a
Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject
to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Purchaser's public stockholders; and
(iii) if the Purchaser holds a shareholder vote to amend the Purchaser's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of the obligation to redeem one-hundred percent (100%) of the
Purchaser Common Stock if the Purchaser fails to complete a Business
Combination within the allotted time period, then for the redemption of any
Purchaser Common Stock properly tendered in connection with such vote. For and
in consideration of the Purchaser agreeing to enter into this Agreement, the
Company hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and hereby agrees
that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may
have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's right to
pursue a claim against the Purchaser for legal relief against monies or other
assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
pursuant to _Section 11.16_ hereof (including a claim for the Purchaser to
specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the
disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account after
giving effect to the redemption of the Purchaser Class A Common Stock pursuant
to the Redemptions in connection with the Closing) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, or for fraud and (y)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company
may have in the future against the Purchaser's assets or funds that are not
held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from
the Trust Account to the Purchaser and any assets that have been purchased or
acquired with any such funds). This _Section 11.13_ shall survive
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

  



  

11.14 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any action for breach of this Agreement may
only be made against, the Parties to this Agreement, and no Non-Recourse Party
of a Party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, except with respect to Fraud against the
person who committed such Fraud.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

11.15 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. Any Action based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the Transactions may be brought in
federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware, and each of the
Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court
in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
personal jurisdiction, manner of service of process, venue or to convenience
of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any other court.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any Party to
serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings
or otherwise proceed against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in
each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to
this _Section 11.15_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH
CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

  



  

11.16 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights of each
Party to consummate the Transactions are unique, recognizes and affirms that
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any Party, money damages would
be inadequate and the non-breaching Parties would not have adequate remedy at
law, and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by an applicable Party in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or restraining order to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other security
or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to
any other right or remedy to which such Party may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity.

A-4

 



    



  

2. Rights Relating To Dividends, Subdivisions and Combinations.

  



  

(a) Subject to the rights of holders of any Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding having prior rights as to dividends, the holders of the Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as
and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of any assets of the Company
legally available therefor, such dividends as may be declared from time to
time by the Board of Directors. Except as permitted in Section 2(b), any
dividends paid to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock shall be paid pro rata, on an equal priority, pari passu
basis, unless different treatment of the shares of each such class is
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and a majority of the outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

  



  

(b) The Company shall not declare or pay any dividend to the holders of Class
A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock payable in securities of the Company
unless the same dividend with the same record date and payment date shall be
declared and paid on all shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that (i)
dividends payable in shares of Class A Common Stock or rights to acquire
shares of Class A Common Stock may be declared and paid to the holders of
Class A Common Stock without the same dividend or distribution being declared
and paid to the holders of the Class B Common Stock if, and only if, a
dividend payable in shares of Class B Common Stock, or rights to acquire
shares of Class B Common Stock, as applicable, are declared and paid to the
holders of Class B Common Stock at the same rate and with the same record
date and payment date; and (ii) dividends payable in shares of Class B Common
Stock or rights to acquire shares of Class B Common Stock may be declared and
paid to the holders of Class B Common Stock without the same dividend being
declared and paid to the holders of the Class A Common Stock if, and only if,
a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or rights to acquire
shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, are declared and paid to the
holders of Class A Common Stock at the same rate and with the same record
date and payment date.

  



  

(c) If the Company in any manner subdivides or combines (including by
reclassification) the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock, then the outstanding shares of all Common Stock will be
subdivided or combined in the same proportion and manner.

  



  

3. Liquidation Rights. In the event of a Liquidation Event, upon the completion of the distributions required with respect to any Preferred Stock that may then be outstanding, the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution to stockholders, or consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company, in the case of an Acquisition constituting a Liquidation Event, shall be distributed on an equal priority, pro rata basis to the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (and the holders of any Preferred Stock that may then be outstanding, to the extent required by the Certificate of Incorporation including any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock), unless different treatment of the shares of each such class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a class; _provided, however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that compensation pursuant to any employment, consulting, severance or other compensatory arrangement to be paid to or received by a person who is also a holder of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock does not constitute consideration or a "distribution to stockholders" in respect of the Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock.

  



    

A-5

 



    



  

4. Voting Rights.

  



  

(a) Class A Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Class A Common Stock shall
be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held.

  



  

(b) Class B Common Stock. Each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock shall
be entitled to one vote for each share thereof held.

  



  

(c) Voting Generally. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Preferred Stock, Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate series
or classes. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, holders of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to
vote on any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely
to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the
holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together
with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant
to the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law.

  



  

(d) Liquidation Event. So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are
outstanding, the Company shall not effect or approve any Liquidation Event
without, in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

5. Optional Conversion.

  



  

(a) Optional Conversion of the Class B Common Stock.

  



  

(i) At the option of the holder thereof, each share of Class B Common Stock
shall be convertible, at any time or from time to time, into one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock as provided herein.

  



  

(ii) Each holder of Class B Common Stock who elects to convert the same into
shares of Class A Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor (if any), duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Class B Common Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the
same and shall state therein the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock
to be converted, or, if the shares are uncertificated, immediately prior to
the close of business on the date that the holder delivers notice of such
conversion to the Company's transfer agent and the person entitled to receive
the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Class A
Common Stock at such time.

  



  

6. Automatic Conversion.

  



  

(a) Automatic Conversion of the Class B Common Stock. Each share of Class B
Common Stock shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon a Transfer, other than a
Permitted Transfer, of such share of Class B Common Stock. Such conversion
shall occur automatically without the need for any further action by the
holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such
shares (if any) are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue
certificates evidencing the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Class B Common
Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided
below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement
satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by
it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such
automatic conversion of the Class B Common Stock, the holders of Class B
Common Stock so converted shall surrender the certificates representing such
shares (if any) at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
Class A Common Stock.

  



    

A-6

 



    



  

(b) Final Conversion. On the Final Conversion Date, each issued share of
Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without any further action, convert
into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock. Following
the Final Conversion Date, the Company shall not issue any additional shares
of Class B Common Stock. Such conversion shall occur automatically without the
need for any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not
the certificates representing such shares (if any) are surrendered to the
Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Class A Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such
shares of Class B Common Stock are either delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and
executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company
from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the
occurrence of such automatic conversion of the Class B Common Stock, the
holders of Class B Common Stock so converted shall surrender the certificates
representing such shares (if any) at the office of the Company or any
transfer agent for the Class A Common Stock.

  



  

(c) Procedures. The Company may, from time to time, establish such policies
and procedures relating to the conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A
Common Stock and the general administration of this dual class stock
structure, including the issuance of stock certificates (or the establishment
of book-entry positions) with respect thereto, as it may deem reasonably
necessary or advisable, and may from time to time request that holders of
shares of Class B Common Stock furnish certifications, affidavits or other
proof to the Company as it deems necessary to verify the ownership of Class B
Common Stock and to confirm that a conversion to Class A Common Stock has not
occurred. A determination by the Secretary of the Company as to whether a
Transfer results in a conversion to Class A Common Stock shall be conclusive
and binding.

  



  

(d)  Immediate Effect. In the event of a conversion of shares of Class B
Common Stock to shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6,
such conversion(s) shall be deemed to have been made at the time that the
Transfer of shares occurred or immediately upon the Final Conversion Date, as
applicable. Upon any conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common
Stock, all rights of the holder of shares of Class B Common Stock shall cease
and the person or persons in whose names or names the certificate
or certificates (or book-entry position(s)) representing the shares of Class
A Common Stock are to be issued shall be treated for all purposes as having
become the record holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common Stock.

  



  

7. Redemption. The Common Stock is not redeemable.

  



  

8. Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Class B Common Stock, as applicable, such number of its shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, as applicable, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such numbers of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

  



  

9. Prohibition on Reissuance of Shares. Shares of Class B Common Stock that are acquired by the Company for any reason (whether by repurchase, upon conversion, or otherwise) shall be retired in the manner required by law and shall not be reissued as shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



    

A-7

 



    



  

V.

  



  

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Company, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of
the Company, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof,
as the case may be, it is further provided that:

  



  

A. Board of Directors.

  



  

1. Generally. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The number of directors that shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.

  



  

2. Election.

  



  

(a) So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the
holders of record of the shares of Class B Common Stock, exclusively, shall
be entitled to elect three (3) directors of the Company or, if applicable,
such greater number of directors as may be provided by Subsection 2(b). If
the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock fail to elect a sufficient
number of directors to fill all directorships for which they are entitled to
elect directors, voting exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to the
first sentence of this Subsection 2(a), then any directorship not so filled
shall remain vacant until such time as such directorship is filled in
accordance with Subsection 4(a); no such directorship may be filled by
stockholders of the Company other than by the holders of record of the shares
of Class B Common Stock, voting exclusively and as a separate class.

  



  

(b) At any time when any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding and
the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors is
greater than seven (7), the number of directors that may be elected by the
holders of record of the shares of Class B Common Stock, exclusively (the "
_Class B Directors_ "), shall be increased to the sum of three (3) and the
smallest whole number that is at least 50% of the authorized number of
directors in excess of seven (7). By way of example, the number of Class B
Directors shall be four if the authorized number of directors is eight (8) or
nine (9) and shall be five (5) if the authorized number of directors is ten
(10) or eleven (11).

  



  

(c) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the holders of
record of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and of
any other class or series of stock entitled to vote in the election of
directors, exclusively and voting together as a single class on an as-
converted to Class A Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect all
directors other than Class B Directors.

  



  

(d) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall
be divided into three classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III,
respectively. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third
of the total number of such directors. The Board of Directors is authorized to
assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to such classes at
the time the classification becomes effective. At the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the time at which such initial classification of the
Board of Directors becomes effective, the initial term of office of the Class
I directors shall expire. At the second annual meeting of stockholders
following the time at which such initial classification of the Board of
Directors becomes effective, the initial term of office of the Class II
directors shall expire. At the third annual meeting of stockholders following
the time at which such initial classification of the Board of Directors
becomes effective, the initial term of office of the Class III directors shall
expire. At each annual meeting of stockholders following the time at which
such initial classification of the Board of Directors becomes effective, the
successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall
be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in
the third year following the year of their election.

  



    

A-8

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each director
shall serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until
his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
incumbent director.

  



  

(f) No stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate
votes.

  



  

(g) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence
in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in Voting Power of the
outstanding shares of the class(es) or series entitled to elect such director
shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director.

  



  

(h) Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of
the Company so provide.

  



  

3. Removal of Directors.

  



  

(a) So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, any or all
of the Class B Directors may be removed, without cause, by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the shares Class B
Common Stock.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in Subsection 3(a) and subject to any limitations
imposed by applicable law and the rights of any series of Preferred Stock to
remove directors elected by such series of Preferred Stock, any individual
director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from office, but
only for cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of
the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors.

  



  

4. Vacancies.

  



  

(a)  So long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, a vacancy
in the office of any Class B Director resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the number of Class B Directors shall be
filled by, and only by, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock or by any remaining Class B Director or Class B
Directors, although less than a quorum. Any director elected or appointed to
fill a vacancy or newly created directorship in accordance with the preceding
sentence shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders to
elect the class of directors to which such director is elected or appointed
and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or
until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

(b) Except as provided in Subsection 4(a) and subject to any limitations
imposed by applicable law and the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall,
unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such
vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders
and except as otherwise provided by applicable law, be filled only by the
Board of Directors by a majority of the directors then in office, although
less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and not by the
stockholders. Any director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy or newly
created directorship in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold
office until the next annual meeting of stockholders to elect the class of
directors to which such director is elected or appointed and until such
director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or until such
director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



    

A-9

 



    



  

5. Preferred Directors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or more series, have the right to elect additional directors, then upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right continues: (a) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Company shall automatically be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions; and (b) each such additional director shall serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock), the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized number of directors of the Company shall be reduced accordingly.

  



  

B. Stockholder Actions. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the
Company except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Company and no action shall be taken by the
stockholders by consent. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the
election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company shall be given in the manner
provided in the Bylaws of the Company.

  



  

C. Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or
repeal the Bylaws of the Company. The stockholders shall also have power to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Company; _provided, however,_ that,
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Company required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by
stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class.

  



  

VI.

  



  

A. The liability of the directors of the Company for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director shall be eliminated to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law.

  



  

B. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may provide
indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) directors, officers,
employees and agents of the Company (and any other persons to which applicable
law permits the Company to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions,
agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



    

A-10

 



    



  

C. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall only be prospective
and shall not affect the rights under this Article VI in effect at the time
of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act giving rise to
liability.

  



  

VII.

  



  

A. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all
such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court
for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom shall be the
sole and exclusive forum for the following claims or causes of action under
Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative claim or cause of action
brought on behalf of the Company; (B) any claim or cause of action for
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or
other employee of the Company, to the Company or the Company's stockholders;
(C) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former
director, officer or other employee of the Company, arising out of or pursuant
to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws
of the Company (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any claim
or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the
validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company (as
each may be amended from time to time, including any right, obligation, or
remedy thereunder); (E) any claim or cause of action as to which the DGCL
confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and
(F) any claim or cause of action against the Company or any current or former
director, officer or other employee of the Company, governed by the internal
affairs doctrine or otherwise related to the Company's internal affairs, in
all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's
having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
defendants. This Article VII shall not apply to claims or causes of action
brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other
claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

  



  

B. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be
the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

VIII.

  



  

A. Any person or Entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest
in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of
and to have consented to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

B. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph C. of this
Article VIII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are
granted subject to this reservation.

  



  

C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote,
but in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the Certificate
of Incorporation, (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3%
of the Voting Power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as
a single class, shall be required to alter, amend or repeal, or adopt any
provision inconsistent with, Articles V, VI, VII and VIII and (ii) so long as
any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock shall be required to adopt, amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision
of the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that adversely affects the
powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock or the holders
thereof in respect of such shares.

(i) For nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of
Section 5(a), the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the corporation on a timely basis as set
forth in Section 5(b)(iii) and must update and supplement such written
notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder's
notice shall set forth: (A) as to each nominee such stockholder proposes to
nominate at the meeting: (1) the name, age, business address and residence
address of such nominee, (2) the principal occupation or employment of such
nominee, (3) the class or series and number of shares of each class or series
of capital stock of the corporation that are owned of record and beneficially
by such nominee, (4) the date or dates on which such shares were acquired and
the investment intent of such acquisition, and (5) all other information
concerning such nominee as would be required to be disclosed in a proxy
statement soliciting proxies for the election of such nominee as a director in
an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved and whether
or not proxies are being or will be solicited), or that is otherwise required
to be disclosed pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act (including such
person's written consent to being named in the corporation's proxy statement
and associated proxy card as a nominee of the stockholder and to serving as a
director if elected); and (B) all of the information required by Section
5(b)(iv). The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such
other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of
such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation
(as such term is used in any applicable stock exchange listing requirements or
applicable law) or on any committee or sub-committee of the Board of
Directors under any applicable stock exchange listing requirements
or applicable law, or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee.
The number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the annual
meeting (or in the case of a stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a
beneficial owner, the number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for
election at the annual meeting on behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not
exceed the number of directors to be elected at such annual meeting.

  



  

(ii) Other than proposals sought to be included in the corporation's proxy
materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act, for business other than
nominations for the election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section
5(a), the stockholder must deliver written notice to the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the corporation on a timely basis as set
forth in Section 5(b)(iii), and must update and supplement such written
notice on a timely basis as set forth in Section 5(c). Such stockholder's
notice shall set forth: (A) as to each matter such stockholder proposes to
bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including
the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that
such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the
proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting,
and any material interest (including any anticipated benefit of such business
to any Proponent (as defined below) other than solely as a result of its
ownership of the corporation's capital stock, that is material to
any Proponent individually, or to the Proponents in the aggregate) in such
business of any Proponent; and (B) the information required by Section
5(b)(iv).

of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first
anniversary of the immediately preceding year's annual meeting;
_provided, however,_ that, subject to the last sentence of this Section
5(b)(iii), in the event that (A) the date of the annual meeting is advanced
more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder
to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the
120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the
tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made by the corporation or (B) the corporation did not have
an annual meeting in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be
timely must be so received not later than the tenth day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no
event shall an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting for which
notice has been given, or the public announcement thereof has been made,
commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
stockholder's notice as described above.

  



  

(iv) The written notice required by Sections 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii) shall also
set forth, as of the date of the notice and as to the stockholder giving the
notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made (each, a "Proponent" and collectively, the "Proponents"):
(A) the name and address of each Proponent, including, if applicable, such
name and address as they appear on the corporation's books and records; (B)
the class, series and number of shares of each class or series of the capital
stock of the corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned of record or
beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act) by each
Proponent (provided, that for purposes of this Section 5(b)(iv), such
Proponent shall in all events be deemed to beneficially own all shares of any
class or series of capital stock of the corporation as to which such
Proponent has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time in the
future); (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(whether oral or in writing) with respect to such nomination or proposal
(and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of capital stock of the
corporation) between or among any Proponent and any of its affiliates or
associates, and any others (including their names) acting in concert, or
otherwise under the agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any of the
foregoing; (D) a representation that the Proponents are holders of record or
beneficial owners, as the case may be, of shares of the corporation at the
time of giving notice, will be entitled to vote at the meeting, and intend to
appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons
specified in the notice (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or
to propose the business that is specified in the notice (with respect to a
notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (E) a representation as to whether the
Proponents intend to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of
a sufficient number of the corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee
or nominees (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(i)) or to carry such
proposal (with respect to a notice under Section 5(b)(ii)); (F) to the extent
known by any Proponent, the name and address of any other
stockholder supporting the proposal on the date of such stockholder's notice;
and (G) a description of all Derivative Transactions (as defined below) by
each Proponent during the previous 12 month period, including the date of the
transactions and the class, series and number of securities involved in, and
the material economic terms of, such Derivative Transactions.

(c) A stockholder providing the written notice required by Section 5(b)(i) or
(ii) shall update and supplement such notice in writing, if necessary, so
that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice is
true and correct in all material respects as of (i) the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and (ii) the
date that is five Business Days (as defined below) prior to the meeting and,
in the event of any adjournment or postponement thereof, five Business Days
prior to such adjourned or postponed meeting. In the case of an update and
supplement pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5(c), such update and
supplement shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not later than five Business Days after the later
of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of
the meeting or the public announcement of such record date. In the case of an
update and supplement pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5(c), such
update and supplement shall be received by the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the corporation not later than two Business Days prior
to the date for the meeting, and, in the event of any adjournment or
postponement thereof, two Business Days prior to such adjourned or postponed
meeting.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5(b)(iii) to the contrary, in the
event that the number of directors in an Expiring Class (as defined below) to
be elected to the Board of Directors at the annual meeting is increased
effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due
under Section 5(b)(iii) and there is no public announcement by the corporation
naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days before
the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a
stockholder's notice required by this Section 5 and that complies with the
requirements in Section 5(b)(i), other than the timing requirements in
Section 5(b)(iii), shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for the additional directorships in such Expiring Class, if it shall
be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following
the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
For purposes of this section, an "Expiring Class" shall mean a class of
directors whose term shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director
at an annual meeting, unless the person is nominated in accordance with
either clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 5(a) and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 5(b), Section 5(c), and Section 5(d), as
applicable. Only such business shall be conducted at any annual meeting of the
stockholders of the corporation as shall have been brought before the meeting
in accordance with clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) of Section 5(a) and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5(b) and Section 5(c),
as applicable. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the
chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made, or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in
compliance with these Bylaws, or the Proponent does not act in
accordance with the representations in Sections 5(b)(iv)(D) and 5(b)(iv)(E),
to declare that such proposal or nomination shall not be presented for
stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded, or that such
business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of
such nomination or such business may have been solicited or received.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, unless otherwise
required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the
stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the
corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such
nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be
transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 5, to be
considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a
duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be
authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such
writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing
or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in order to
include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy
statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, a stockholder must
also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect
any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act;
_provided, however,_ that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or
the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit
the requirements applicable to proposals and/or nominations to be considered
pursuant to Section 5(a)(iii). Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to
affect any rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock to
nominate and elect directors pursuant to and to the extent provided in any
applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation.

class or series of shares or other securities of the corporation;

  



  

(B) that otherwise provides any direct or indirect opportunity to gain or
share in any gain derived from a change in the value of securities of the
corporation;

  



  

(C) the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit
from changes in value or price with respect to any securities of the
corporation; or

  



  

(D) that provides the right to vote or increase or decrease the voting power
of, such Proponent, or any of its affiliates or associates, directly or
indirectly, with respect to any securities of the corporation,

  



  

which agreement, arrangement, interest or understanding may include, without

any proportionate interest of such Proponent in the securities of the
corporation held by any general or limited partnership, or any limited
liability company, of which such Proponent is, directly or indirectly, a
general partner or managing member; and

  



  

   

B-6

 



    



  

(v) "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported
by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news

or by such other means reasonably designed to inform the public or security
holders in general of such information, including, without limitation,
posting on the corporation's investor relations website.

  



  

Section 6. Special Meetings.

  



  

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called,
for any purpose as is a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware
law, by (i) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chief
Executive Officer, or (iii) the Board of Directors. The corporation may
postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously
scheduled by the Board of Directors.

  



  

(b) The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place, if any, of
such special meeting. Upon determination of the time and place, if any, of
the meeting, the Secretary shall cause a notice of meeting to be given to the
stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section
7\. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than
specified in the notice of meeting.

  



  

(c) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the
Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which
directors are to be elected (i) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof or (ii) provided that the
Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such
meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record
(and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf
such nomination or nominations are made, only if such beneficial owner was the
beneficial owner of shares of the corporation) at the time of giving notice
provided for in this paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who
delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting forth the
information required by Sections 5(b)(i) and 5(b)(iv). The number of nominees
a stockholder may nominate for election at the special meeting (or in the case
of a stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the
number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the special
meeting on behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of
directors to be elected at such special meeting. In the event the corporation
calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or
more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record may
nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such
position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if written
notice setting forth the information required by Sections 5(b)(i)
and 5(b)(iv) shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not earlier than 120 days prior to such special
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day
prior to such meeting or the tenth day following the day on which the
corporation first makes a public announcement of the date of the special
meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected
at such meeting. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such
information as required under Section 5(c). In no event shall an adjournment
or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, or
the public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described
above.

  



  

   

B-7

 



    



  

A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at
the special meeting unless the person is nominated either in accordance with
clause (i) or clause (ii) of this Section 6(c). Except as otherwise required
by applicable law, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and
duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or
business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, or if the Proponent does not
act in accordance with the representations in Sections 5(b)(iv)(D) and
5(b)(iv)(E), to declare that such nomination shall not be presented for
stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded, notwithstanding
that proxies in respect of such nomination may have been solicited or
received. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, unless
otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative
of the stockholder (as defined in Section 5(e))) does not appear at the
special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination,
such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect
of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a stockholder
must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this
Section 6. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act; _provided, however,_
that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act or the rules
and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the
requirements applicable to nominations for the election to the Board of
Directors to be considered pursuant to Section 6 (c).

  



  

Section 7. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by applicable
law, notice, given in writing or by electronic transmission, of each meeting
of stockholders shall be given not less than ten nor more than 60 days before
the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
Such notice shall specify the place, if any, date, hour and in the case of
special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such record date
is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at any such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the corporation. If
delivered by courier service, the notice is given on the earlier of when the
notice is received or left at the stockholder's address. If given via
electronic mail, notice is given when directed to such stockholder's
electronic mail address in accordance with applicable law unless (a) the
stockholder has notified the corporation in writing or by electronic
transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail or (b)
electronic transmission of such notice is prohibited by applicable law. Notice
of the time, place, if any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders (to
the extent required) may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled
to notice thereof, or by electronic transmission by such person, either
before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by his or
her attendance thereat in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any
stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the
proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had
been given.

  



  

Section 8. Quorum and Vote Required. At all meetings of stockholders, except
where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation,
or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the
meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the
absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from
time to time, either by the chairperson of the meeting or by vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares represented thereat
and entitled to vote thereon, but no other business shall be transacted at
such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting,
at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum.

  



  

   

B-8

 



    



  

Except as otherwise provided by statute or by applicable stock exchange
rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters
other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the
meeting and voting affirmatively or negatively (excluding abstentions and
broker non-votes) on such matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Except
as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares
present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by
proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election of
directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is
required, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws or any applicable stock exchange rules, the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such
class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum
entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except
where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws or any applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority (plurality, in the case of the election of
directors) of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or
series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
represented by proxy at the meeting and voting affirmatively or negatively
(excluding abstention and broker non-votes) on such matter shall be the act
of such class or classes or series.

  



  

Section 9. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time
either by the chairperson of the meeting or by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the
meeting and entitled to vote thereon. When a meeting is adjourned to another
time or place, if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communication, if
any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed present in person
and may vote at such meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact
any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If
the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of
Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting,
and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record
as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or adjournment thereof,
except as otherwise provided by applicable law, only persons in whose names
shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date shall
be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to
vote shall have the right to do so either in person, by remote communication,
if applicable, or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in
accordance with Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder.
No proxy shall be voted after three years from its date of creation unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it
states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder
may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and
voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the corporation a
revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at
meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

  



  

   

B-9

 



    



  

Section 11. Joint Owners of Stock. If shares or other securities having
voting power stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common,
tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the
same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary
is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the
instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it
is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following
effect: (a) if only one votes, his or her act binds all; (b) if more than one
votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one
votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction
may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the
Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in Section 217(b) of the
DGCL. If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy
is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of
subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

  



  

Section 12. List of Stockholders. The corporation shall prepare, at least ten
days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
showing the address of each stockholder and the number and class of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder; provided, however, if the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days
before the meeting date, the list shall reflect all of the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event
that the corporation determines to make the list available on an
electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. The
list shall be open to examination of any stockholder during the time of the
meeting as provided by applicable law.

  



  

Section 13. Action without Meeting. No action shall be taken by the
stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders duly called in accordance with these Bylaws, and no action shall
be taken by the stockholders by consent.

  



  

Section 14. Remote Communication. For the purposes of these Bylaws, if
authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to
such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
stockholders and proxyholders may, by means of remote communication:

  



  

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether
such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication, provided that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder,
(ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such
stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or
proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote

such committee of the time and place, if any, of such special meeting given in

committee, a majority of the authorized number of members of any such
committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the

which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60
days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of

Agents.

  



  

(a) Directors and Executive Officers. The corporation shall indemnify to the
full extent permitted under and in any manner permitted under the DGCL or any
other applicable law, any person who is made or threatened to be made a party
to or is otherwise involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any threatened,
pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (hereinafter, a "Proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that such person is or was a director or executive officer (for the
purposes of this Article XI, "executive officers" shall be those persons
designated by the corporation as (a) executive officers for purposes of the
disclosures required in the corporation's proxy and periodic reports or (b)
officers for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act) of the corporation, or
while serving as a director or executive officer of the corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee,
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(collectively, "Another Enterprise"), against expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines (including ERISA excise taxes or penalties) and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in
connection with such Proceeding; _provided, however,_ that the corporation
shall not be required to indemnify any director or executive officer in
connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person
unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by applicable
law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized in the specific case by the Board of
Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the
corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv)
such indemnification is required to be made under subsection (d) of this
Section 46.

  



  

(b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents. The corporation shall have
power to indemnify (including the power to advance expenses in a manner
consistent with subsection (c) of this Section 46) its other officers,
employees and agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law.
The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of
whether indemnification shall be given to any such person to such officers or
other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.

  



  

(c) Expenses. The corporation shall, to the full extent permitted under and
in any manner permitted under the DGCL or any other applicable law, pay the
expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or executive
officer in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses
incurred by a director or executive officer in his or her capacity as a
director or executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf
of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right
to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 46 or
otherwise.

  



  

   

B-21

 



    



  

(d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express contract,
all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
executive officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual
rights, shall vest when the person becomes a director or executive officer of
the corporation, shall continue as vested contract rights even if such person
ceases to be a director or executive officer of the corporation, and shall be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or
executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding
such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for
indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no
disposition of such claim is made within 90 days of request therefor. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the claimant in such enforcement
action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim
for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense
to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct
that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the
corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the
burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Section 46 or
otherwise shall be on the corporation.

  



  

(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this
Section 46 shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may
have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

  



  

(f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

(g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other
applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may
purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted
to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 46.

  



  

(h) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this Section 46 shall only be
prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Section 46 as in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any Proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

  



  

(i) Saving Clause. If this Article XI or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer
to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article
XI that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If
this Article XI shall be invalid due to the application of the
indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation
shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent
permitted under any other applicable law.

corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such

(b) Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may
be given by the method stated in subsection (a), as otherwise provided in
these Bylaws (including by any of the means specified in Section 22(d)), or by

whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person
shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental
authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such
person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to
any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force
and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the
action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if
such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all
persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom

of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation
entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class.

Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of
shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to
deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation
at common law or under any statute.

constitute a defense to the enforcement of any of such covenants or
obligations against Securityholder. Nothing in this Support Agreement shall
limit any of the rights or remedies of Purchaser under the Merger Agreement,
or any of the rights or remedies of Purchaser or any of the obligations of
Securityholder under any agreement between such Person and Purchaser or any
certificate or instrument executed by such Person in favor of Purchaser; and

the Company under the Merger Agreement, or any of the rights or remedies of
Purchaser or the Company or any of the obligations of any Supporting Party

not to the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family"
shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child (including by adoption), father,
mother, brother or sister of the undersigned, and lineal
descendant (including by adoption) of the undersigned or of any of the
foregoing persons; and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule

3. In the event that the Company releases or waives, in full or in part, any party from a lock-up agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger, then the same percentage of Lock-up Shares held by the undersigned as the percentage of Lock-up Shares (or such equivalent term as defined in such lock-up agreement) held by such released party to such party's aggregate number of Lock-up Shares that are the subject of such waiver or release shall be immediately and fully released on the same terms from the applicable prohibition(s) set forth herein. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph will not apply if the release or waiver is granted to a holder of Common Stock in connection with a follow-on public offering of Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC, whether or not such offering or sale is wholly or partially a secondary offering of the Common Stock, and the undersigned, only to the extent the undersigned has a contractual right to demand or require the registration of the undersigned's Common Stock or "piggyback" on a registration statement filed by the Company for the offer and sale of its Common Stock, has been given an opportunity to participate on a basis consistent with such contractual rights in such follow-on offering. In the event that the Company changes, amends, modifies or waives (other than to correct a typographical error) any particular provision of any other lock-up agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger, then the undersigned shall be offered the option (but not the requirement) to make a corresponding change, amendment, modification or waiver to this Letter Agreement.

5. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company, and any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described therein, are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Letter Agreement.

  



  

6. This Letter Agreement replaces Section 7(a) of that certain Letter Agreement, dated June 30, 2020, among the Company, the Sponsor, Cowen Investments and the Company's officers and directors, which Section 7(a) shall be terminated and of no further effect with respect to Securityholder upon the Closing of the Merger, and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the undersigned (i) Securityholder and (ii) the Company.

  



  

7. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Letter Agreement shall be binding on the Securityholder and each of its respective successors, heirs and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

8. This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) all agree that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Delaware Chancery Court, and irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

9. This Letter Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Lock-up Period and (ii) the liquidation of the Company.

transfer of shares of Common Stock to the Company in connection therewith (x)
deemed to occur upon the "cashless" or "net" exercise of such options or

Agreement during the Lock-Up Period;

effective time of the Merger, of any trading plan providing for the sale of
shares of Common Stock by the Securityholder, which trading plan meets the
requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_

amended (the " _Code_ "), or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Regulations_ ") after the date on which the MA was
executed by the parties, and such change prevents the Merger from qualifying
as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368 of the Code (and the Merger
does not qualify for similar tax-free treatment pursuant to any successor or
other provision of the Code or Regulations taking into account such changes),
in each case solely and to the extent necessary to cover any tax liability as
a direct result of the transaction. 
---|---|---

 _provided, however_ , that (A) in the case of clauses (i) through (vii),
these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in
substantially the form of this Letter Agreement (it being understood that any
references to "immediate family" in the agreement executed by such transferee
shall expressly refer only to the immediate family of the Securityholder and
not to the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family"
shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child (including by adoption), father,
mother, brother or sister of the undersigned, and lineal
descendant (including by adoption) of the undersigned or of any of the
foregoing persons; and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

3. In the event that the Company releases or waives, in full or in part, any party from a lock-up agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger, then the same percentage of Lock-up Shares held by the undersigned as the percentage of Lock-up Shares (or such equivalent term as defined in such lock-up agreement) held by such released party to such party's aggregate number of Lock-up Shares that are the subject of such waiver or release shall be immediately and fully released on the same terms from the applicable prohibition(s) set forth herein. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph will not apply if the release or waiver is granted to a holder of Common Stock in connection with a follow-on public offering of Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC, whether or not such offering or sale is wholly or partially a secondary offering of the Common Stock, and the undersigned, only to the extent the undersigned has a contractual right to demand or require the registration of the undersigned's Common Stock or "piggyback" on a registration statement filed by the Company for the offer and sale of its Common Stock, has been given an opportunity to participate on a basis consistent with such contractual rights in such follow-on offering. In the event that the Company changes, amends, modifies or waives (other than to correct a typographical error) any particular provision of any other lock-up agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger, then the undersigned shall be offered the option (but not the requirement) to make a corresponding change, amendment, modification or waiver to this Letter Agreement.

  



  

   

G-3

 



    



  

4. The Lock-Up Period shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) 180 days after the closing date of the Merger, (ii) the closing of a merger, liquidation, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction after the closing date of the Merger that results in all of the public stockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash securities or other property, or (iii) the day after the date on which the closing price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the closing date of the Merger.

  



  

5. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company, and any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described therein, are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Letter Agreement.

  



  

6. This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the undersigned (i) Securityholder and (ii) the Company.

  



  

7. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Letter Agreement shall be binding on the Securityholder and each of its respective successors, heirs and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

8. This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) all agree that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Delaware Chancery Court, and irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

9. This Letter Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Lock-up Period and (ii) the liquidation of the Company.

Immediately upon the filing and effectiveness of this Amended and Restated

1.11 " _Voting Control_ " means, with respect to a share of Class B Common

shares of Class A Common Stock shall surrender the certificate or
certificates therefor (if any), duly endorsed, at the office of the Company
or any transfer agent for the Class B Common Stock, and shall give written
notice to the Company at such office that such holder elects to convert the
same and shall state therein the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
being converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock
to be converted, or, if the shares are uncertificated, immediately prior to
the close of business on the date that the holder delivers notice of such
conversion to the Company's transfer agent and the person entitled to receive
the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Class A Common
Stock at such time.

  



  

   

I-5

 



    



  

5.  _Automatic Conversion_.

  



  

5.1 _Automatic Conversion of the Class B Common Stock_. Each share of Class B
Common Stock shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock upon a Transfer, other than a
Permitted Transfer, of such share of Class B Common Stock. Such
conversion shall occur automatically without the need for any further action
by the holders of such shares and whether or not the
certificates representing such shares (if any) are surrendered to the Company
or its transfer agent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares
of Class B Common Stock are either delivered to the Company or its transfer
agent as provided below, or the holder notifies the Company or its transfer
agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes
an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any
loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. Upon the occurrence
of such automatic conversion of the Class B Common Stock, the holders of Class
B Common Stock so converted shall surrender the certificates representing
such shares (if any) at the office of the Company or any transfer agent for
the Class A Common Stock.

  



  

5.2 _Final Conversion_. On the Final Conversion Date, each issued share of
Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without any further action,
convert into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock.
Following the Final Conversion Date, the Company shall not issue any
additional shares of Class B Common Stock. Such conversion shall occur
automatically without the need for any further action by the holders of such
shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares (if any)
are surrendered to the Company or its transfer agent; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing
the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless the
certificates evidencing such shares of Class B Common Stock are either
delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as provided below, or the
holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates have
been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the
Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection
with such certificates. Upon the occurrence of such automatic conversion of
the Class B Common Stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock so converted
shall surrender the certificates representing such shares (if any) at the
office of the Company or any transfer agent for the Class A Common Stock.

  



  

5.3 _Procedures_. The Company may, from time to time, establish such policies
and procedures relating to the conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A
Common Stock and the general administration of this dual class stock
structure, including the issuance of stock certificates (or the establishment
of book-entry positions) with respect thereto, as it may deem reasonably
necessary or advisable, and may from time to time request that holders of
shares of Class B Common Stock furnish certifications, affidavits or other
proof to the Corporation as it deems necessary to verify the ownership of
Class B Common Stock and to confirm that a conversion to Class A Common Stock
has not occurred. A determination by the Secretary of the Company as to
whether a Transfer results in a conversion to Class A Common Stock shall be
conclusive and binding.

  



  

   

I-6

 



    



  

5.4 _Immediate Effect_. In the event of a conversion of shares of Class B
Common Stock to shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 5_
, such conversion(s) shall be deemed to have been made at the time that the
Transfer of shares occurred or immediately upon the Final Conversion Date, as
applicable. Upon any conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common
Stock, all rights of the holder of shares of Class B Common Stock shall cease
and the person or persons in whose names or names the certificate or
certificates (or book-entry position(s)) representing the shares of Class A
Common Stock are to be issued shall be treated for all purposes as
having become the record holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common
Stock.

  



  

6.  _Redemption_. The Common Stock is not redeemable.

  



  

7. _Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion_. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Class B Common Stock, as applicable, such number of its shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, as applicable, the Company will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such numbers of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

8. _Prohibition on Reissuance of Shares_. Shares of Class B Common Stock that are acquired by the Company for any reason (whether by repurchase, upon conversion, or otherwise) shall be retired in the manner required by law and shall not be reissued as shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

B. PREFERRED STOCK

  



  

360,500,000 shares of the authorized and unissued Preferred Stock of the
Corporation are hereby designated "Series A Preferred Stock" with the
following rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions,
qualifications and limitations. Unless otherwise indicated, references to
"sections" or "subsections" in this _Part B_ of this _Article Fourth_  refer
to sections and subsections of _Part B_ of this _Article Fourth_.

  



  

   

I-7

 



    



  

1.  _Dividends_.

  



  

The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares
of any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation (other
than dividends on shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock)
unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents required elsewhere in
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall simultaneously receive, a
dividend on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount at
least equal to (i) in the case of a dividend on Common Stock or any class or
series that is convertible into Common Stock, that dividend per share of
Series A Preferred Stock as would equal the product of (A) the dividend
payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as
if all shares of such class or series had been converted into Common Stock and
(B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share
of Series A Preferred Stock, without giving effect to the limitations set
forth in _Subsection 4.2.3_ , in each case calculated on the record date for
determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (ii) in the
case of a dividend on any class or series that is not convertible into Common
Stock, at a rate per share of Series A Preferred Stock determined by (A)
dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or
series of capital stock by the original issuance price of such class or
series of capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization
with respect to such class or series) and (B) multiplying such fraction by an
amount equal to the Series A Original Issue Price (as defined below);
_provided_ that, if the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside, on the same
date, a dividend on shares of more than one class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation, the dividend payable to the holders of Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to this _Section 1_ shall be calculated based upon the
dividend on the class or series of capital stock that would result in the
highest Series A Preferred Stock dividend. The "Series A Original Issue
Price" shall mean $0.77138 per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar
recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

2.  _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up; Certain Mergers, Consolidations
and Asset Sales_.

  



  

2.1 _Preferential Payments to Holders of Series A Preferred Stock_. In the
event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders, and in the event of a Deemed
Liquidation Event (as defined below), the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the
consideration payable to stockholders in such Deemed Liquidation Event or out
of the Available Proceeds (as defined below), as applicable, before any
payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their
ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Series
A Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or
(ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock pursuant to _Section
4_  immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed
Liquidation Event (the amount payable pursuant to this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as the "Series A Liquidation Amount"). If upon any
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed
Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this
_Subsection 2.1_ , the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
share ratably in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in
proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in
respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by them upon such
distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were
paid in full.

  



  

   

I-8

 



    



  

2.2 _Payments to Holders of Common Stock_. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after
the payment in full of all Series A Liquidation Amounts required to be paid to
the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders or, in the case
of a Deemed Liquidation Event, the consideration not payable to the holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to _Subsection 2.1_ or the
remaining Available Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be distributed among
the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, pro
rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder; _provided_ that
shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may receive, or have
the right to elect to receive, different or disproportionate consideration in
connection with a Deemed Liquidation Event if the only differences in the per
share consideration to the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock are that any securities distributed to the holders of, or
issuable upon the conversion of, a share of Class B Common Stock (i) have ten
times the voting power of any securities distributed to the holders of, or
issuable upon the conversion of, a share of Class A Common Stock with respect
to any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets,
or similar transaction of the surviving or resulting corporation of such
Deemed Liquidation Event and (ii) have the right to elect, exclusively and as
a separate class, directors of the surviving or resulting corporation of such
Deemed Liquidation Event.

  



  

2.3 _Deemed Liquidation Events_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Definition_. Each of the following events shall be considered a
"Deemed Liquidation Event" unless the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which majority must include
the Lead Investor (as defined in the Investors' Rights Agreement, dated June
17, 2019, by and among the Corporation and the other parties thereto, as such
agreement may be amended from time to time (the "Investors' Rights
Agreement")) so long as neither the Lead Investor nor any of its Affiliates
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) is a Defaulting
Holder (as defined below) (the "Requisite Holders"), and the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock, voting together as a single class, elect otherwise by written notice
sent to the Corporation at least five (5) days prior to the effective date of
any such event:

  



   | (a)| a merger or consolidation in which 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the Corporation is a constituent party or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party and the
Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or
consolidation, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

I-9

 



    



  

except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a
subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to represent, or
are converted into or exchanged for shares of capital stock that
represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, a majority, by
voting power, of the capital stock, with substantially the
same properties/rights, of (1) the surviving or resulting corporation; or (2)
if the surviving or resulting corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of
another corporation immediately following such merger or consolidation, the
parent corporation of such surviving or resulting corporation; or

  



  

(b) (1) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in
a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or
any subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (2) the sale or
disposition (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, and whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions) of one or more
subsidiaries of the Corporation if substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary
or subsidiaries, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license
or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

  



  

2.3.2 _Effecting a Deemed Liquidation Event_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Deemed Liquidation
Event referred to in _Subsection 2.3.1(a)(i)_ unless the agreement or plan of
merger or consolidation for such transaction (the "Merger Agreement") provides
that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation in such
Deemed Liquidation Event shall be paid to the holders of capital stock of the
Corporation in accordance with _Subsections 2.1_ and _2.2_.

  



  

(b) In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event referred to in _Subsection
2.3.1(a)(ii)_ or _2.3.1(b)_ , if the Corporation does not effect a
dissolution of the Corporation under the General Corporation Law within ninety
(90) days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, then (i) the Corporation shall
send a written notice to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock no later than
the ninetieth (90th) day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such
holders of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right)
pursuant to the terms of the following clause (ii) to request the non-
redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) unless the
Requisite Holders request otherwise in a written instrument delivered to the
Corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after such Deemed
Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the
Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained
liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation),
together with any other assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, all to the extent permitted by Delaware law
governing distributions to stockholders (the "Available Proceeds"), on the
one hundred fiftieth (150th) day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to
redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price per
share equal to the Series A Liquidation Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event of a redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the
Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of
each holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of
such Available Proceeds, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise
be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the Available Proceeds
were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the
remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under Delaware law
governing distributions to stockholders. Prior to the distribution
or redemption provided for in this _Subsection 2.3.2(b)_ , the Corporation
shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed
Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with
such Deemed Liquidation Event.

  



  

   

I-10

 



    



  

2.3.3 _Amount Deemed Paid or Distributed_. The amount deemed paid or
distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any
such merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, exclusive license, other
disposition or redemption shall be the cash or the value of the property,
rights or securities to be paid or distributed to such holders pursuant to
such Deemed Liquidation Event. The value of such property, rights or
securities shall be mutually agreed by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, including the approval of Lead Series A Director (as defined in
the Voting Agreement, dated June 17, 2019, by and among the Corporation and
the other parties thereto, as such agreement may be amended from time to
time) (the "Lead Series A Director"), and the Requisite Holders. If the
Requisite Holders and the Board of Directors are not able to agree on the
valuation amount within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed twenty
(20) days), the valuation amount shall be determined by an investment banking
firm of national recognition, which firm shall be unaffiliated with each of
the Corporation and the Requisite Holders and shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Board of Directors and the Requisite Holders. If the Board
of Directors and the Requisite Holders are unable to agree upon an acceptable
investment banking firm within ten (10) days after the date either party
proposed that one be selected, the investment banking firm will be selected
by an arbitrator located in New York, New York, selected by the American
Arbitration Association (or if such organization ceases to exist, the
arbitrator shall be chosen by a court of competent jurisdiction). The
arbitrator shall select the investment banking firm (within ten (10) days of
his appointment) from a list, jointly prepared by the Requisite Holders and
the Board of Directors, of not more than six (6) investment banking firms of
national standing in the United States, of which no more than three (3) may
be named by the Board of Directors and no more than three (3) may be named by
the Requisite Holders. The arbitrator may consider, within the ten (10) day
period allotted, arguments from the parties regarding which
investment banking firm to choose, but the selection by the arbitrator shall
be made in its sole discretion from the list of six (6). The Board of
Directors and the Requisite Holders shall submit their respective valuations
and other relevant data to the investment banking firm, and the investment
banking firm shall as soon as practicable thereafter make its own
determination of the valuation amount. The final valuation amount for
purposes hereof shall be the average of the two valuation amounts closest
together, as determined by the investment banking firm, from among the
valuation amounts submitted by the Corporation and the Requisite Holders and
the valuation amount calculated by the investment banking firm. The
determination of the final valuation amount by such investment banking firm
shall be final and binding upon the parties. The Corporation shall pay the
fees and expenses of the investment banking firm and arbitrator (if any) used
to determine the valuation amount. If required by any such investment banking
firm or arbitrator, the Corporation shall execute a retainer and engagement
letter containing reasonable terms and conditions, including, without
limitation, customary provisions concerning the rights of indemnification and
contribution by the Corporation in favor of such investment banking firm or
arbitrator and its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents and
affiliates. If the valuation amount is for Common Stock of the Corporation,
the valuation amount shall not include a discount for minority ownership or
illiquidity or a control premium.

2.3.4 _Allocation of Escrow and Contingent Consideration_. In the event of a
Deemed Liquidation Event pursuant to _Subsection 2.3.1(a)(i)_ , if any
portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is
payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies (the "Additional
Consideration"), the Merger Agreement shall provide that (a) the portion of
such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such portion, the
"Initial Consideration") shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with _Subsections 2.1_ and _2.2_ as if
the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection
with such Deemed Liquidation Event; and (b) any Additional Consideration
which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon
satisfaction of such contingencies shall be allocated among the holders of
capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with _Subsections 2.1_ and
_2.2_ after taking into account the previous payment of the Initial
Consideration as part of the same transaction. For the purposes of this
_Subsection 2.3.4_ , consideration placed into escrow or retained as a
holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar
obligations in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed
to be Additional Consideration.

  



  

3.  _Voting_.

  



  

3.1 _General_. On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation
for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each
holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Class A Common
Stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder
are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to vote on such matter, without giving effect to the limitations set
forth in _Subsection 4.2.3_. Except as provided by law or by the other
provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders
of Series A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as a single class and on an as-converted
to Class A Common Stock basis, without giving effect to the limitations set
forth in _Subsection 4.2.3_.

  



  

3.2 _Election of Directors_.

  



  

3.2.1 The holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to elect three (3)
directors of the Corporation and the holders of record of the shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, exclusively and voting together as a
single class, shall be entitled to elect three (3) directors of the
Corporation or, if applicable, such greater number of directors as may be
provided by _Subsection 3.2.2_. Any director elected as provided in the
preceding sentence may be removed without cause by, and only by, the
affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of
capital stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a
special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or
pursuant to a written consent of stockholders. If the holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as
the case may be, fail to elect a sufficient number of directors to fill all
directorships for which they are entitled to elect directors, voting
exclusively and as a separate class, pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Subsection 3.2.1_ , then any directorship not so filled shall remain vacant
until such time as the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Class A
Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, elect a person to
fill such directorship by vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting; and
no such directorship may be filled by stockholders of the Corporation other
than by the stockholders of the Corporation that are entitled to elect a
person to fill such directorship, voting exclusively and as a separate class.
The holders of record of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common Stock and of any other class or series of voting stock (including the
Series A Preferred Stock), exclusively and voting together as a single class
on an as-converted to Class A Common Stock basis, shall be entitled to elect
the balance of the total number of directors.

  



  

   

I-12

 



    



  

3.2.2 At any time when the authorized number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors is greater than seven (7), the number of directors
that may be elected by the holders of record of the shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock, exclusively and voting together as a single
class (the "Common Directors"), shall be increased to the sum of three (3) and
the smallest whole number that is at least 50% of the authorized number of
directors in excess of seven (7). By way of example, the number of Common
Directors shall be four if the authorized number of directors is eight (8) or
nine (9) and shall be five (5) if the authorized number of directors is ten
(10) or eleven (11).

  



  

3.2.3 At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such
director shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing such director.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Subsection 3.2_ , a vacancy in any
directorship filled by the holders of any class or series shall be filled
only by vote or consent in lieu of a meeting of the holders of such class or
series or by any remaining director or directors elected by the holders of
such class or series pursuant to this _Subsection 3.2_.

  



  

3.3 _Series A Preferred Stock Protective Provisions_. At any time when shares
of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall
not, either directly or indirectly by amendment, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, do any of the following without (in addition to any other vote
required by law or this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) the
written consent or affirmative vote of the Requisite Holders given in writing
or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voting (as the case may be) separately
as a class, and any such act or transaction entered into without such consent
or vote shall be null and void _ab initio_ , and of no force or effect.

  



  

3.3.1 liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the business and affairs of the
Corporation, effect any merger or consolidation or any other Deemed
Liquidation Event, or consent to any of the foregoing;

  



  

3.3.2 amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation in a manner
that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Series A
Preferred Stock or the holders thereof in respect of such shares, or effect a
reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the outstanding equity
interests in the Company;

  



  

   

I-13

 



    



  

3.3.3 create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or obligate itself to
issue shares of, any additional class or series of capital stock, or increase
the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or increase the
authorized number of shares of any additional class or series of capital
stock of the Corporation;

  



  

3.3.4 (i) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security of the Corporation
that is pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of
the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, the payment of dividends or rights of redemption, if such
reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other security
senior to the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of any such right,
preference, or privilege or (ii) reclassify, alter or amend any existing
security of the Corporation that is junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in
respect of the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, the payment of dividends or rights of
redemption, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render
such other security senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock
in respect of any such right, preference or privilege;

  



  

3.3.5 purchase or redeem (or permit any subsidiary to purchase or redeem) or
pay or declare any dividend, or make any distribution on, any shares of
capital stock of the Corporation other than (i) redemptions of or dividends
or distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock as expressly authorized
herein, (ii) dividends or other distributions payable on the Common Stock
solely in the form of additional shares of Common Stock and (iii) repurchases
of stock from former employees, officers, directors, consultants or other
persons who performed services for the Corporation or any subsidiary in
connection with the cessation of such employment or service at the lower of
the original purchase price or the then-current fair market value thereof as
approved by the Board of Directors, including the approval of at least one
Series A Director;

  



  

3.3.6 create, or hold capital stock in, any subsidiary that is not wholly
owned (either directly or through one or more other subsidiaries) by the
Corporation, or permit any subsidiary to create, or authorize the creation
of, or issue or obligate itself to issue, any shares of any class or series
of capital stock, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any capital stock
of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or permit any direct
or indirect subsidiary to sell, lease, transfer, exclusively license or
otherwise dispose (in a single transaction or series of related transactions)
of all or substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary;

  



  

3.3.7 increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting
the Board of Directors of the Corporation; or

  



  

3.3.8 permit any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation to take any
of the above actions under _Subsections 3.3.1_ through _3.3.7_.

  



  

   

I-14

 



    



  

4.  _Optional Conversion_.

  



  

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as
follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

  



  

4.1 _Right to Convert_. Other than as indicated in _Subsection 4.2_ herein,
each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment
of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock as is determined by
dividing the Series A Original Issue Price by the Series A Conversion Price
(as defined below) in effect at the time of conversion. The "Series A
Conversion Price" shall initially be equal to $0.77138. Such initial Series A
Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Series A Preferred Stock
may be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, shall be subject to
adjustment as provided below.

  



  

4.2 _Special Mandatory Conversion_.

  



  

4.2.1 If, at any time after June 17, 2019, a Second Tranche Closing (as
defined in that certain Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated
June 17, 2019, by and among the Company and the purchasers of Series A
Preferred Stock named therein, as such agreement is amended from time to time
(the "Purchase Agreement")), occurs pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Purchase
Agreement, then each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by a holder who
(together with such holder's Affiliates (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement)) is required under the Purchase Agreement to purchase
Second Tranche Closing Shares (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) at the
Second Tranche Closing and does not purchase at the Second Tranche Closing, or
within five (5) business days thereafter, at least the number of Second
Tranche Closing Shares set forth opposite such holder's name on _Schedule A_
attached to the Purchase Agreement under the heading "Second Tranche
Closing," taking into account any Second Tranche Elective Closing Shares
previously acquired by such Purchaser (a "Defaulting Holder") or by any
transferee, assignee or pledgee of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
originally purchased by such Defaulting Holder shall be automatically
and without further action on the part of such holder converted into shares
of Class A Common Stock at a ratio of 10 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
for 1 share of Class A Common Stock (such conversion, a "Mandatory Conversion
Upon Default"), effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Second
Tranche Closing (the "Second Tranche Offering Date").

  



  

4.2.2 Without limiting or delaying any Mandatory Conversion Upon Default, the
Defaulting Holders holding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
converted pursuant to _Subsection 4.2.1_ shall, if the Series A Preferred
Stock is certificated, deliver to the Company at the office of the Company or
any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or at such other place as
may be designated by the Company, the certificate or certificates for the
shares so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Company. As
promptly as practicable thereafter, if the Series A Preferred Stock is
certificated, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder, at the
place designated by such holder, a certificate or certificates for the full
number of shares of Class A Common Stock to which such holder is entitled.
The person in whose name such shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued
shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record of such shares of
Class A Common Stock on the Second Tranche Offering Date unless the
transfer books of the Company are closed on that date, in which event such
person shall be deemed to have become a stockholder of record on the next
succeeding date on which the transfer books are open. Failure by a Defaulting
Holder to deliver its certificate(s) for shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall not affect the Mandatory Conversion Upon Default, and any such
certificate(s) shall only represent the right to receive shares of Class A
Common Stock at a ratio of 1 share of Class A Common Stock for each 10
shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted.

  



  

   

I-15

 



    



  

4.2.3 Notwithstanding anything contained in _Subsection 4.1_ above to the
contrary, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible
into shares of Class A Common Stock at the election of any holder pursuant to
_Subsection 4.1_ during the period beginning on June 17, 2019 and ending
immediately following the earlier to occur of the sixth (6th) business day
following the Second Tranche Closing and the Second Tranche Closing
Termination Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a firmly underwritten initial
public offering of the Company's securities pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (an "IPO"), or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Company shall
provide each holder of Series A Preferred Stock written notice at least
twenty (20) days' prior to the consummation of such IPO or Deemed Liquidation
Event and, upon delivery of such notice, each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to convert such holder's shares of Series A Preferred
Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Subsection 4.1_
 hereof. Any conversion effected or attempted to be effected in contravention
of this _Subsection 4.2.3_ shall be null and void; _provided_ that any such
conversion or attempted conversion shall be effective if, in a resolution duly
approved by the disinterested members of the Company's Board of Directors,
such conversion is approved and is designated by the disinterested members of
the Company's Board of Directors as being exempt from a Second Tranche
Closing.

  



  

4.3 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Class A Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair
market value of a share of Class A Common Stock as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled
pursuant to _Subsection 4.2_ above, the Company shall pay the Original Issue
Price of such fractional share. Whether or not fractional shares would be
issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock the holder is at the time
converting into Class A Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of
Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

4.4 _Mechanics of Conversion_.

  



  

4.4.1 _Notice of Conversion_. In order for a holder of Series A Preferred
Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of
Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Subsection 4.1_ , such holder shall (a)
provide written notice to the Corporation's transfer agent at the office of
the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at the principal
office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer
agent) that such holder elects to convert all or any number of such holder's
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and, if applicable, any event on which
such conversion is contingent and (b), if such holder's shares are
certificated, surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that such
certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit
and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at
the office of the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock (or at the
principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own
transfer agent). Such notice shall state such holder's name or the names of
the nominees in which such holder wishes the shares of Class A Common Stock to
be issued. If required by the Corporation, any certificates surrendered for
conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or his, her or its attorney duly authorized
in writing. The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent
(or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent)
of such notice and, if applicable, certificates (or lost certificate
affidavit and agreement) shall be the time of conversion (the "Conversion
Time"), and the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the specified shares shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such
date. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time
(i) issue and deliver to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to his,
her or its nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance
with the provisions hereof and a certificate for the number (if any) of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate
that were not converted into Class A Common Stock, (ii) pay in cash such
amount as provided in _Subsection 4.2_ in lieu of any fraction of a share of
Class A Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (iii) pay all
declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
converted.

  



  

4.4.2 _Reservation of Shares_. The Corporation shall at all times when the
Series A Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, reserve and keep available out
of its authorized but unissued capital stock, for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, such number of its duly
authorized shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Series A Preferred
Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase
its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without
limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder
approval of any necessary amendment to this Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Series A Conversion Price below the then par value of the
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action which may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may
validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A
Common Stock at such adjusted Series A Conversion Price.

  



  

4.4.3 _Effect of Conversion_. All shares of Series A Preferred Stock which
shall have been surrendered for conversion as herein provided shall no longer
be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall
immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right
of the holders thereof to receive shares of Class A Common Stock in exchange
therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise
issuable upon such conversion as provided in _Subsection 4.2_ and to receive
payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be
reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take
such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be
necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock accordingly.

  



  

   

I-17

 



    



  

4.4.4 _No Further Adjustment_. Upon any such conversion, no adjustment to the
Series A Conversion Price shall be made for any declared but unpaid dividends
on the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on the Class A
Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

  



  

4.4.5 _Taxes_. The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other similar
taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of
Class A Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
pursuant to this _Section 4_. The Corporation shall not, however, be required
to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issuance and delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock in a name other than
that in which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted were
registered, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until
the person or entity requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the
amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Corporation, that such tax has been paid.

or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock if the
Corporation receives written notice from the Requisite Holders agreeing that
no such adjustment shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed
issuance of such Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock.

  



  

4.5.3 _Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A
Original Issue Date shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities
(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted
Securities) or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of
any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible
Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock (as set
forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any
conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such
number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of
Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of
such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Class
A Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record
date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.

  



  

   

I-20

 



    



  

(b) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance of which
resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the
terms of _Subsection 4.5.4_ , are revised as a result of an amendment to such
terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or
Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms
pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible
Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or
decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease
becoming effective, the Series A Conversion Price computed upon the
original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A
Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised terms been in effect
upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no readjustment pursuant to this clause (b)
shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price to an
amount which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a result of the issuance
of such Option or Convertible Security, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price
that would have resulted from any issuances of Additional Shares of Class A
Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Class A
Common Stock as a result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible
Security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.

  



  

(c) If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding Options or
Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities), the
issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of _Subsection 4.5.4_  (either because the
consideration per share (determined pursuant to _Subsection 4.5.5_ ) of the
Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock subject thereto was equal to or
greater than the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, or because such
Option or Convertible Security was issued before the Series A Original Issue
Date), are revised after the Series A Original Issue Date as a result of an
amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of
such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to
such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or
Convertible Security) to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the
consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or
exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended or adjusted,
and the Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock subject thereto (determined
in the manner provided in _Subsection 4.5.3(a)_ shall be deemed to have been
issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective.

  



  

(d) Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or
unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) which
resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms)
in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
_Subsection 4.5.4_ , the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such
Series A Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or
Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued.

  



  

   

I-21

 



    



  

(e) If the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security,
or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion
and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such Option or Convertible
Security is issued or amended but is subject to adjustment based upon
subsequent events, any adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price provided
for in this _Subsection 4.5.3_ shall be effected at the time of such issuance
or amendment based on such number of shares or amount of consideration
without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any
subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of
this _Subsection 4.5.3_ ). If the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or
Convertible Security, or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon
such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the
time such Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended, any adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Price that would result under the terms of this
_Subsection 4.5.3_ at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be
effected at the time such number of shares and/or amount of consideration is
first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for
purposes of calculating such adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price that
such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first
be made.

  



  

4.5.4 _Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional
Shares of Class A Common Stock_. In the event the Corporation shall at any
time after the Series A Original Issue Date issue Additional Shares of Class A
Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock deemed to
be issued pursuant to _Subsection 4.5.3_ ), without consideration or for a
consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, then the Series A
Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to a price
(calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance
with the following formula:

  



  

CP2 = CP1* (A + B) ÷ (A + C).

  



  

For purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply:

  



  

(a) "CP2" shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately
after such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Class A Common
Stock

  



  

(b) "CP1" shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Class A
Common Stock;

  



  

(c) "A" shall mean the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of
Class A Common Stock (treating for this purpose as outstanding all shares of
Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options outstanding
immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance or upon conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities (including the Series A Preferred Stock)
outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor)
immediately prior to such issue);

  



  

   

I-22

 



    



  

(d) "B" shall mean the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that would
have been issued if such Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock had been
issued or deemed issued at a price per share equal to CP1 (determined by
dividing the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation in respect
of such issue by CP1); and

  



  

(e) "C" shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Class A Common
Stock issued in such transaction.

  



  

4.5.5 _Determination of Consideration_. For purposes of this _Subsection 4.5_
, the consideration received by the Corporation for the issuance or deemed
issuance of any Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock shall be computed as
follows:

  



   | (a)| _Cash and Property_ : Such consideration shall: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate
amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding amounts paid or payable
for accrued interest; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed
at the fair market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| in the event Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock are
issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such
consideration so received, computed as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

I-23

 



    



  

(b) _Options and Convertible Securities_. The consideration per share
received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock
deemed to have been issued pursuant to _Subsection 4.5.3_ , relating to
Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by dividing:

  



   | (i)| The total amount, if any, received or receivable by the
Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as
set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any
provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration)
payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of
Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for
Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in
the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained
therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise
of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities,
or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such
Convertible Securities. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

4.5.6 _Multiple Closing Dates_. In the event the Corporation shall issue on
more than one date Additional Shares of Class A Common Stock that are a part
of one transaction or a series of related transactions and that would result
in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
_Subsection 4.5.4_ , then, upon the final such issuance, the Series A
Conversion Price shall be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as
if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving
effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent
issuances within such period).

  



  

4.6 _Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations_. If the Corporation shall
at any time or from time to time after the Series A Original Issue Date
effect a subdivision of the outstanding Class A Common Stock, the Series A
Conversion Price in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be
proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in
proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Class A
Common Stock outstanding. If the Corporation shall at any time or from time
to time after the Series A Original Issue Date combine the outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately
before the combination shall be proportionately increased so that the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such
series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate
number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. Any adjustment under
this subsection shall become effective at the close of business on the date
the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

  



  

   

I-24

 



    



  

4.7 _Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions_. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A
Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable on the Class A Common Stock in Additional Shares of
Class A Common Stock, then and in each such event the Series A Conversion
Price in effect immediately before such event shall be decreased as of the
time of such issuance or, in the event such a record date shall have been
fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the
Series A Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

  



  

(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Class A
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

  



  

(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Class A
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such
issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or
distribution.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing (a) if such record date shall have been fixed
and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made
on the date fixed therefor, the Series A Conversion Price shall be recomputed
accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and
thereafter the Series A Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
subsection as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions; and (b) that no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other
distribution of shares of Class A Common Stock in a number equal to the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock as they would have received if all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into Class A
Common Stock on the date of such event.

  



  

4.8 _Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions_. In the event the
Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Series A
Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or
other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a
distribution of shares of Class A Common Stock in respect of outstanding
shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the provisions of _Section 1_
do not apply to such dividend or distribution, then and in each such event
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously
with the distribution to the holders of Class A Common Stock, a dividend or
other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to
the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if
all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into
Class A Common Stock on the date of such event.

  



  

   

I-25

 



    



  

4.9 _Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc_. Subject to the provisions
of _Subsection 2.3_ , if there shall occur any
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger
involving the Corporation in which the Class A Common Stock (but not the
Series A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash
or other property (other than a transaction covered by _Subsections 4.4_ ,
_4.6_ or _4.7_ ), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of Series A Preferred
Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Class A Common
Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and
amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of
one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in
such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the
provisions in this _Section 4_ with respect to the rights and interests
thereafter of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the
provisions set forth in this _Section 4_ (including provisions with respect
to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price) shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any
securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock.

  



  

4.10 _Certificate as to Adjustments_. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to this  _Section
4_ , the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable but in any event not later than ten (10) days thereafter, compute
such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a certificate setting
forth such adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property into which the Series A Preferred Stock is
convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than ten (10) days thereafter),
furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth
(i) the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, and (ii) the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities,
cash or property which then would be received upon the conversion of Series A
Preferred Stock.

  



  

4.11 _Notice of Record Date_. In the event:

  



  

(a) the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Class A Common
Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) for the purpose of entitling or
enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive
any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any
class or any other securities, or to receive any other security; or

  



  

(b) of any capital reorganization of the Corporation, any reclassification of
the Class A Common Stock of the Corporation, or any Deemed Liquidation Event;
or

  



  

(c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of
the Corporation,

  



  

   

I-26

 



    



  

then, and in each such case, the Corporation will send or cause to be sent to
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock a notice specifying, as the case
may be, (i) the record date for such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii)
the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is
proposed to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the
holders of record of Class A Common Stock (or such other capital stock or
securities at the time issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Class A Common Stock (or
such other capital stock or securities) for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation,
merger, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per
share and character of such exchange applicable to the Series A Preferred
Stock and the Class A Common Stock. Such notice shall be sent at least ten
(10) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified
in such notice.

  



  

5.  _Mandatory Conversion_.

  



  

5.1 _Trigger Events_. Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public
offering at a price per share of at least $1.15707 (subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or
other similar recapitalization with respect to the Common Stock), or such
lesser price as may be approved by the Requisite Holders, pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
resulting in at least $100,000,000 of proceeds, net of the underwriting
discount and commissions to the Corporation and in connection with such
offering the Common Stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market\'s
National Market, the New York Stock Exchange or another exchange or
marketplace approved the Board of Directors, including the approval of the
Lead Series A Director or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an
event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders (the time
of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event
specified in such vote or written consent is referred to herein as the
"Mandatory Conversion Time"), then (i) all outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Class A
Common Stock, at the then effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to
_Subsection 4.1.1_ and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the
Corporation.

  



  

5.2 _Procedural Requirements_. All holders of record of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be sent written notice of the Mandatory Conversion Time
and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of
Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 5_. Such notice need not
be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time. Upon
receipt of such notice, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in
certificated form shall surrender his, her or its certificate or certificates
for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against
any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged
loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the
place designated in such notice. If so required by the Corporation, any
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its
attorney duly authorized in writing. All rights with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock converted pursuant to _Subsection 5.1_ , including the
rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Class A
Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time
(notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender
any certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the
holders thereof, upon surrender of any certificate or certificates of such
holders (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the
items provided for in the next sentence of this _Subsection 5.2_. As soon as
practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and, if applicable, the
surrender of any certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit
and agreement) for Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall (a) issue
and deliver to such holder, or to his, her or its nominees, a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Class A Common Stock issuable
on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and (b) pay cash
as provided in _Subsection 4.2_ in lieu of any fraction of a share of Class A
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of
any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
converted. Such converted Series A Preferred Stock shall be retired and
cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the
Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for
stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock accordingly.

6.  _Redemption_.

  



  

6.1 _General_. Unless prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to
stockholders, shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation at a price equal to the greater of (A) the Series A Original Issue
Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon and (B) the
Fair Market Value (determined in the manner set forth below) of a single share
of Series A Preferred Stock as of the date of the Corporation's receipt of
the Redemption Request (the "Redemption Price"), in three (3) annual
installments commencing not more than sixty (60) days after receipt by the
Corporation at any time on or after the Third-Party Transfer Rights
Expiration Date (as defined in the Investors' Rights Agreement) from the
holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, which holders must include the Lead Investor so long as
neither the Lead Investor nor any of its Affiliates is a Defaulting Holder, of
written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock (the "Redemption Request"). Upon receipt of a Redemption Request, the
Corporation shall apply all of its assets to any such redemption, and to no
other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law
governing distributions to stockholders. For purposes of this _Subsection 6.1_
, the Fair Market Value of a single share of Series A Preferred Stock shall
be the value of a single share of Series A Preferred Stock as mutually
determined by (x) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (which holders must include the Lead Investor so
long as neither the Lead Investor nor any of its Affiliates is a Defaulting
Holder) and (y) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class,
and, in the event that they are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party
appraiser selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including the
approval of Lead Series A Director. The date of each such installment
provided in the Redemption Notice (as defined below) shall be referred to as
a "Redemption Date." On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on
a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates
(including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in
_Subsection 6.2_ ) shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the
calculations set forth in this sentence. If on any Redemption Date, Delaware
law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the Corporation from
redeeming all shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the
Corporation shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may
redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as
soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.

  



  

   

I-28

 



    



  

6.2 _Redemption Notice_. The Corporation shall send written notice of the
mandatory redemption (the "Redemption Notice") to each holder of record of
Series A Preferred Stock not less than forty (40) days prior to each
Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

  



  

(a) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the holder that
the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the
Redemption Notice;

  



  

(b) the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

  



  

(c) the date upon which the holder's right to convert such shares terminates
(as determined in accordance with _Subsection 4.1_ ); and

  



  

(d) for holders of shares in certificated form, which the holder is to
surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his,
her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

  



  

If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the twentieth (20th ) day after
the date of delivery of the Redemption Notice to a holder of Series A
Preferred Stock, written notice from such holder that such holder elects to
be excluded from the redemption provided in this _Section 6_ , then the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock registered on the books of the Corporation
in the name of such holder at the time of the Corporation's receipt of such
notice shall thereafter be "Excluded Shares." Excluded Shares shall not be
redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this _Section 6_ , whether on such
Redemption Date or thereafter.

  



  

6.3 _Surrender of Certificates; Payment_. On or before the applicable
Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to
be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his,
her or its right to convert such shares as provided in  _Section 4_ , shall,
if a holder of shares in certificated form, surrender the certificate or
certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate
affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption
Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to
the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or
certificates as the owner thereof. In the event less than all of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed,
a new certificate, instrument, or book entry representing the unredeemed
shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

  



  

   

I-29

 



    



  

6.4 _Interest_. If any shares of Preferred Stock are not redeemed for any
reason on any Redemption Date, all such unredeemed shares shall
remain outstanding and entitled to all the rights and preferences provided
herein, and the Corporation shall pay interest on the Redemption Price
applicable to such unredeemed shares at an aggregate per annum rate equal to
the prime rate, from time to time in effect, as published in The Wall Street
Journal, with such interest to accrue daily in arrears and be compounded
annually; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall such interest
exceed the maximum permitted rate of interest under applicable law (the
"Maximum Permitted Rate"), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation
shall take all such actions as may be necessary, including without
limitation, making any applicable governmental filings, to cause the Maximum
Permitted Rate to be the highest possible rate. In the event any provision
hereof would result in the rate of interest payable hereunder being in excess
of the Maximum Permitted Rate, the amount of interest required to be paid
hereunder shall automatically be reduced to eliminate such excess; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any subsequent increase in the Maximum Permitted
Rate shall be retroactively effective to the applicable Redemption Date to
the extent permitted by law.

  



  

6.5 _Rights Subsequent to Redemption_. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the
Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment
or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor
in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any
of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not
have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all
rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date
terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption
Price without interest upon surrender of any such certificate or certificates
therefor.

  



  

7. _Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares_. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock following redemption.

  



  

8. _Waiver_. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of Series A Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the Requisite Holders.

  



  

9. _Notices_. Any notice required or permitted by the provisions of this Article Fourth to be given to a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law, and shall be deemed sent upon such mailing or electronic transmission.

FIFTH: Subject to any additional vote required by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, in furtherance and not in limitation
of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly
authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind any or all of the Bylaws
of the Corporation.

  



  

SIXTH: Subject to any additional vote required by this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the number of directors of the
Corporation shall be determined in the manner set forth in the Bylaws of the
Corporation. Each director shall be entitled to one vote on each matter
presented to the Board of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that, so long as
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to elect a Series A
Director, the affirmative vote of the Lead Series A Director shall be required
for the authorization by the Board of Directors of any of the matters set
forth in Section 5.4 of the Investors' Rights Agreement.

  



  

SEVENTH: Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

  



  

EIGHTH: Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide. The books of the
Corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or places
as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the
Bylaws of the Corporation.

  



  

NINTH: To the fullest extent permitted by law, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the General
Corporation Law or any other law of the State of Delaware is amended after
approval by the stockholders of this Article Ninth to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law as so
amended.

  



  

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Ninth
by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or
increase the liability of any director of the Corporation with respect to any
acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to, such repeal or
modification.

  



  

TENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is
authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers and agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to
which General Corporation Law permits the Corporation to provide
indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or
other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise,
in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by
Section 145 of the General Corporation Law.

  



  

Any amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this
Article Tenth shall not (a) adversely affect any right or protection of
any director, officer or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time
of such amendment, repeal or modification or (b) increase the liability of
any director of the Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such
director, officer or agent occurring prior to, such amendment, repeal or
modification.

  



  

   

I-31

 



    



  

ELEVENTH: The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity. An "Excluded
Opportunity" is any matter, transaction or interest that is presented to, or
acquired, created or developed by, or which otherwise comes into the
possession of (i) any director of the Corporation who is not an employee of
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) any holder of Series A
Preferred Stock or any partner, member, director, stockholder, employee,
affiliate or agent of any such holder, other than someone who is an employee
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the persons
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are "Covered Persons"), unless such
matter, transaction or interest is presented to, or acquired, created or
developed by, or otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person
expressly and solely in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the
Corporation while such Covered Person is performing services in such capacity.
Any repeal or modification of this Article Eleventh will only be prospective
and will not affect the rights under this Article Eleventh in effect at the
time of the occurrence of any actions or omissions to act giving rise to
liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote
of the Requisite Holders, will be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt
any provisions inconsistent with this Article Eleventh.

     

3. That the foregoing amendment and restatement was approved by the holders of the requisite number of shares of this corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the General Corporation Law.

  



  

4. That this Certificate of Incorporation, which restates and integrates and further amends the provisions of this Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law.

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
has been executed by a duly authorized officer of this corporation on this
[●] day of [●], 2020.
