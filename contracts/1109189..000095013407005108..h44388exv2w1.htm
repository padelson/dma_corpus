necessary to provide immediate coverage to the extent such preexisting condition restrictions have
been satisfied or waived, or would have been satisfied or waived, under such JetStar Plan or as

reimburse Basic for all expenses incurred by Basic in connection with this Agreement up to the
Reimbursement Maximum Amount (as defined below) prior to or upon termination of this Agreement.
All payments under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.5</U> shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an account

results in a judgment against JetStar for the payment set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.5</U>,

Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses under this Article&nbsp;8 shall be asserted and resolved by either
a Basic Indemnified Person or a JetStar Indemnified Person (each, an &#147;<U>Indemnified Person</U>&#148;)
as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;An Indemnified Person shall promptly give Basic or the JetStar Stockholders&#146;
Representative, as applicable (each an &#147;<U>Indemnifying Person</U>,&#148; as applicable) notice of any
matter that such Indemnified Person has determined has given or could give rise to a claim for
indemnification (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) under this Article&nbsp;8, stating the amount of the
Indemnified Buyer Loss or Indemnified JetStar Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof,
all with reasonable particularity, and stating with particularity the nature of such matter.
Failure to provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification rights of such
Indemnified Person hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have resulted in Indemnified
Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses that could have been actually avoided had such Claim
Notice been provided within such required time period or to the extent such Claim Notice shall not
have been sent within the time limitations set forth in this Article&nbsp;8. The Indemnifying Person
shall, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Person
in writing as to whether the Indemnifying Person admits or disputes the claim described in the
Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Person gives written notice that it admits the indemnification
claim described in such Claim Notice, then the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;8, and subject to the limitations
hereof, with respect to the estimated amount of Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar
Losses stated in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person in
writing that it disputes such claim for indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of the
Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article&nbsp;8 with respect thereto but disputes the
amount of the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses in connection therewith, or if the
Indemnifying Person fails to notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period that
it either admits or disputes such claim for indemnification, then in either of such cases the
indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be a disputed indemnification claim that
must be resolved by settlement between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, or by
proceedings commenced in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying
Person or the Indemnified Person, or by any other mutually agreeable method.

Person to indemnification hereunder (any such claim, a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), the
Indemnified Person against whom the Third Party Claim is asserted shall give written notice (a
&#147;<U>Third Party Claim Notice</U>&#148;) to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of such Third Party
Claim, describing in such notice in reasonable detail to the extent then known the nature of the
Third Party Claim and the factual basis and circumstances surrounding same and estimating the
amount of Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses attributable to such Third Party
Claim to the extent feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of or binding as to the final
amount of such indemnification claim). A copy of all papers served on or received by the
Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, shall be attached to the Third
Party Claim Notice. The failure of an Indemnified Person to properly deliver a Third Party Claim
Notice to the Indemnifying Person shall not defeat or prejudice the indemnification rights under
this Article&nbsp;8 of such Indemnified Person with respect to the related Third Party Claim

a Third Party Claim (the &#147;<U>Election Period</U>&#148;), the Indemnifying Person shall notify the

shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Person in such defense and will attempt to make
available on a reasonable basis to the Indemnifying Person all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof; provided that the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying
Person or the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there is one or more
legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Person. In any such case, the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses
shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related
action in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances,
include the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local
counsel) for the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not elect to conduct
the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar
Losses shall include all reasonable costs and expenses of such defense as incurred by the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party (and be

(or reimbursed) from amounts due to the Former JetStar Holders from the Escrow Deposit or, in the
event no amounts remaining in the Escrow Deposit are to be distributed to the former holders of
JetStar Shares, from amounts (not to exceed $100,000 in the aggregate) due to Basic from the Escrow
Deposit. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any such amounts due to the
JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative shall be withheld from amounts otherwise due to the Former
JetStar Holders prior to distribution to such Former JetStar Holders. Basic shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay (through advancement, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor) such fees
and expenses, upon the reasonable request of the JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative from time to
time; provided that the aggregate amount of advances shall not exceed $100,000 at any time
outstanding. The JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative shall have the right to refrain from taking
any action if such person believes such funds may not be sufficient pending its request for
agreements and funds from Former JetStar Holders for the provision of additional funds for such purpose and a response
thereto acceptable to the JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative. The provisions of this <U>Section
9.16(c)</U> shall not reduce the right of the JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative to recover costs
and expenses incurred by the JetStar Stockholders&#146; Representative in connection with the defense of
any Third Party Claim as contemplated by <U>Section&nbsp;8.5(c)(i)</U>.
