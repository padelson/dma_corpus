 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of JetStar common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (each a " _JetStar Common Share_ " and collectively the " _JetStar Common Shares_ "), and each share of JetStar Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (each, a " _JetStar Preferred Share_ ", collectively, the " _JetStar Preferred Shares_ " and, together with the JetStar Common Shares, the " _JetStar Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as provided in _Section 2.6_ (with respect to Dissenting JetStar Shares), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Basic, Merger Sub, JetStar or any holder thereof, be converted into (i) the right to receive the cash and Basic Common Shares specified in _Section 2.2(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.2(c)(ii)_ and (ii) certain other rights and benefits provided to former holders of JetStar Shares under this Agreement (including under Article 8). 

  

 (b) _JetStar Options; Cashed-Out Options_. Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, as provided in this Section and in _Section 5.12_, all warrants, options and other rights to acquire JetStar Shares, other than conversion rights under outstanding JetStar Preferred Shares, shall either be exercised or cancelled, or, in the case of unexercised options under the JetStar Option Plan, other property shall be substituted for the JetStar Common Shares issuable upon the 

   ##### 

  

    

exercise thereof as set forth in the following sentence. Prior to the Closing,
JetStar will take appropriate action to elect to substitute the right to
receive cash payment provided under  _Section 5.12_ instead of the right to
purchase JetStar Common Shares with respect to all Cashed-Out Options. Each
Cashed-Out Option will be cashed out rather than exercised, and the holder
thereof (a " _Remaining Option Holder_ ") will be entitled to receive the cash
payment provided under _Section 5.12_ as to that number of shares
potentially acquirable under the Cashed-Out Option and less any applicable
tax withholdings. Additionally, JetStar will take appropriate action to
terminate the JetStar Option Plan as of the Effective Time. In
addition, certain holders of JetStar Options have agreed, prior to or
contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, to exercise their
JetStar Options prior to the Effective Time. Each such holder (an "
_Exercising Holder_ ") may pay the exercise price for his JetStar Options by
delivering a promissory note to JetStar, in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate exercise price for the JetStar Options being exercise (such amount,
an " _Option Loan_ "), which amount shall be due and payable no later than
the Effective Time and which promissory note shall otherwise be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Basic. As a result, as of the Effective Time
no JetStar Options will be outstanding and no such JetStar Options will be
assumed by Basic. 

  

 (c) Conversion of JetStar Common and Preferred Shares. 

  

 (i) _JetStar Common Shares_. Each JetStar Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded JetStar Common Shares (as defined in _Section 2.2(e)(i)_) or any Dissenting JetStar Shares (as defined in _Section 2.6_) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive (in addition to the other rights under this Agreement (including under Article 8)): 

    

(A) at the Effective Time (x) as consideration (together with any
Basic Common Shares specified in _Section 2.2(c)(i)(B)_) for one-half
of each such JetStar Common Share, a number of Basic Common Shares equal to
(1) the Preliminary Total Stock Portion divided by the Basic Share
Price, divided by (2) the Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares, and (y)
as consideration (together with any cash specified in _Section 2.2(c)(i)(B)_
) for the other one-half of each such JetStar Common Share, cash in an amount
equal to (1) the Reallocated Total Cash Portion minus the Escrow Deposit,
divided by (2) the Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares (which cash amount, in
the case of an Exercising Optionholder, may be offset and used to repay any
amounts outstanding and unpaid under the Exercising Optionholders Option
Loan); and 

   

(B) after the Effective Time, any amounts (x) distributable to a
former holder of JetStar Common Shares as provided in _Section 2.4(b)(i)_, 
_Section 2.4(b)(ii)_, _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ and the Escrow Agreement and
(y) payable to a former holder of JetStar Common Shares by Basic after the
Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.5(c)(iii)_. 

  

 (ii) _JetStar Preferred Shares_. Each JetStar Preferred Share issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time, other than any Excluded JetStar Preferred Shares (as defined in _Section 2.2(e)(ii)_ ) or any Dissenting JetStar Shares, shall be converted at the Effective

   ##### 

  

  

  

Time into the right to receive (in addition to the other rights under this
Agreement (including under Article 8)): 

    

(A) at the Effective Time, (x) as consideration (together with any
Basic Common Shares specified in _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(B)_) for one-half
of each such JetStar Preferred Share, a number of Basic Common Shares equal
to (1) the Preliminary Total Stock Portion divided by the Basic Share
Price divided by (2) the Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares, multiplied by (3)
the number of JetStar Common Shares into which such JetStar Preferred
Share could have been converted as of the Effective Time, and (y) as
consideration (together with any cash specified in _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(B)_)
for the other one-half of each such JetStar Preferred Share, cash in an
amount equal to (1) the Reallocated Total Cash Portion minus the Escrow
Deposit, divided by (2) the Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares, multiplied by
(3) the number of JetStar Common Shares into which such JetStar Preferred
Share could have been converted as of the Effective Time; and 

   

(B) after the Effective Time, any amounts (x) distributable to a
former holder of JetStar Preferred Shares as provided in _Section
2.4(b)(i)_,  _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_, _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ and the
Escrow Agreement and (y) payable to a former holder of JetStar Preferred
Shares by Basic after the Effective Time as provided in _Section
2.5(c)(iii)_. 

  

 (d) _Rights of Holders_. Upon the Effective Time, the holders of certificates that represented JetStar Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the cash and Basic Common Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and the other rights under this Agreement (including under Article 8). Until surrendered as contemplated by _Section 2.3(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive such cash and Basic Common Shares and to have such other rights upon such surrender and such holder shall not be entitled to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Basic until after such surrender. 

  

 (e) _Cancellation of Excluded JetStar Shares_. 

  

 (i) Each JetStar Common Share that is owned by JetStar or any Subsidiary of JetStar (the " _Excluded JetStar Common Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (ii) Each JetStar Preferred Share that is owned by JetStar or any Subsidiary of JetStar (the " _Excluded JetStar Preferred Shares_ " and, together with the Excluded JetStar Common Shares, the " _Excluded JetStar Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefore and shall cease to exist.   ##### 

  

     

 (f) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall be the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 SECTION 2.3 _EXCHANGE AGENT; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; PAYMENTS TO REMAINING OPTION HOLDERS_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, Basic shall deposit, in trust for the benefit of the former holders of JetStar Shares, the cash and Basic Common Shares required to make the payments required to be made under _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ and _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(A)_ with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (or another bank or trust company that is organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof that shall be appointed to act as exchange agent hereunder and approved in advance by JetStar in writing) (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Basic and JetStar. Such cash and Basic Common Shares will not be used by the Exchange Agent for any other purpose. For purposes of determining the amount of cash and the number of Basic Common Shares to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, Basic shall assume that the only Dissenting JetStar Shares will be those held by holders of JetStar Shares who have perfected appraisal rights prior to the time the deposit is made. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter, Basic shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of JetStar Shares as of the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded JetStar Shares or Dissenting JetStar Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as Basic and JetStar reasonably agree (including representations from the former holders of the JetStar Shares acknowledging the restrictions applicable to the Basic Common Shares issuable in connection with the Merger), and (ii) instructions for exchanging the Certificates and receiving the cash and Basic Common Shares which such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ or _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(A)_, as applicable and (iii) a signature page for the Registration Rights Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of Basic Common Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ or _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(A)_, as applicable and (y) a check in the aggregate amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ or _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(A)_, as applicable. Basic and the Company shall also use their commercially reasonable efforts to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent so that any holder of JetStar Shares who delivers such materials, duly executed, on or prior to the Closing Date, may receive payment no later than the Business Day immediately succeeding the day on which the Effective Time occurs. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of JetStar Shares (other than Excluded JetStar Shares or Dissenting JetStar Shares) that occurred prior to the Effective Time, but that is not registered in the transfer records of JetStar, the cash and Basic Common Shares that the transferee would have been entitled to receive under _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ or _Section 2.2(c)(ii)(A)_ , as applicable, if such transferee had been the record holder of such JetStar Shares as of the Effective Time, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such JetStar Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. 

   

 (iii) If any certificate for Basic Common Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for Basic Common Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Basic and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Basic in respect of Basic Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Basic Common Shares payable to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions so declared in respect of such Basic Common Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, Basic shall issue or pay to the holder of the certificates representing whole Basic Common Shares issued in exchange for such Certificate (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date that is at or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of surrender of such Certificate and not previously paid to such holder and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Basic Common Shares with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Basic Common Shares, all Basic Common Shares issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _Transfers after the Effective Time_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of JetStar of JetStar Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no certificates or scrip for fractional Basic Common Shares shall be issued in the Merger and no Basic Common Shares dividend, stock split, subdivision or interest shall relate to any fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Basic. In lieu of any such fractional share (after aggregating all fractional Basic Common Shares to be received by such holder), each holder of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a 

   ##### 

  

    

fraction of a Basic Common Share upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange
shall be entitled to receive a cash payment from Basic equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Basic Share Price. No interest shall be payable with
respect to any amounts to be paid under this _Section 2.3(e)_. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Property_. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Basic shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion of the cash and Basic Common Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent, and holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Basic (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the cash or Basic Common Shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_ or _Section 2.2(c)(ii)_ upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Basic, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate with regard to Basic Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if Basic believes that the Person providing the indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, the making of a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Basic or JetStar, or, if Basic does not so believe, the posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Basic to indemnify against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will distribute such cash, Basic Common Shares, dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable or payable in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_, _Section 2.2(c)(ii)_,  _Section 2.3(c)_ or _Section 2.3(e)_, as applicable, in each case without interest. 

  

 (h) _Payments to Remaining Option Holders_. At the Effective Time, Basic or Merger Sub will pay the amounts required under _Section 5.12_ to the Remaining Option Holders, by check or wire transfer, pursuant to a schedule of Remaining Option Holders to be delivered to Basic by JetStar no later than 3 Business Days before the Closing and to be updated by JetStar at the Closing and at the Effective Time. 

  

 (i) _Withholding_. Basic or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of JetStar Shares or Cashed-Out Options pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Basic or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the Treasury Regulations or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Basic or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the JetStar Shares or Cashed-Out Options in respect of when such deduction and withholding was made by Basic or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _ESCROW_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Basic or Merger Sub will deliver Eight Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($8,250,000) (the " _Escrow Deposit_ ") to be received, held 

   ##### 

  

    

and disbursed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and according to
the provisions of  _Section 2.4(b)_. The Escrow Deposit will serve as the
sole source of payment and remedy for Basic to the extent Basic is owed any
amounts in respect of the Final Net Debt and Final Net Working Capital as
provided in _Section 2.5(c)(iii)_. In addition, up to $7,500,000 of
the Escrow Deposit (plus any Escrow Earnings on such amount as described
below) will serve as the sole source of payment and remedy for Basic to the
extent Basic is owed any amounts in respect of Indemnified Buyer Losses as
provided in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_. Any fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall be paid one half by Basic and
one half from the Escrow Deposit. During the period in which the Escrow
Deposit is retained in the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, all interest or other income earned from the investment (and
reinvestment) of such deposit (the " _Escrow Earnings_ ") shall be retained
in such escrow account and added to the Escrow Deposit. 

  

 (b) _Release of Escrow Deposit_. 

  

 (i) On the first Business Day of each calendar quarter after the Effective Time and until the final distribution of the remainder of the Escrow Deposit is made pursuant to paragraph (iii) below, and immediately prior to the final distribution of the remainder of the Escrow Deposit pursuant to paragraph (iii) below, Basic and the JetStar Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute an amount equal to 40% of the Escrow Earnings accruing during the immediately preceding calendar quarter (or, in the case of the final distribution, any period since the last such tax distribution) to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented thereby, in order to provide funds for such former holders of JetStar Shares to pay income taxes in connection with such Escrow Earnings. 

   

 (ii) Promptly following the delivery of the Final Closing Statement, but no later than two Business Days thereafter, Basic and the JetStar Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented thereby, any amounts of the Escrow Deposit in excess of the sum of (A) $7,500,000 plus (B) any amount payable to Basic pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)(iii)_ (to the extent not already paid to Basic from the Escrow Deposit) plus (C) any expenses of the JetStar Stockholders Representative incurred in connection with any matters regarding the Final Closing Statement (whether under _Section 9.7_ or otherwise) (to the extent not already paid from the Escrow Deposit) plus (D) any amounts distributable by the Escrow Agent to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) in accordance with paragraph (i) above, plus (E) Escrow Earnings applicable to the amount described in clause (A). 

   

 (iii) The remainder of the Escrow Deposit after the distributions described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be maintained in the escrow account established under the Escrow Agreement and distributed from time to time to Basic in satisfaction of Indemnified Buyer Losses to the extent permitted under _Section 8.5(d)_; provided that (A) on the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented thereby, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) 50% of (x) the remaining Escrow Deposit _plus_ (y) any Escrow Earnings over (2) the amount of 

     ##### 

 

  

bona fide pending claims for Indemnified Buyer Losses, (B) on the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the
former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro
rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented
thereby, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the remaining Escrow
Deposit _plus_ any Escrow Earnings not paid pursuant to clause (A) of this
proviso over (2) the amount of bona fide pending claims for Indemnified Buyer
Losses, and (C) upon resolution and payment to Basic, if applicable, of
pending claims for Indemnified Buyer Losses outstanding as of the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time that are resolved after the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the
former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro
rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented
thereby, any remaining portion of the Escrow Deposit  _plus_ any Escrow
Earnings not previously distributed pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) of
this proviso. 

   

 SECTION 2.5 _POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS_. 

   

 (a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, JetStar will deliver to Basic a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, JetStars good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (as defined below) and Net Debt (as defined below), in each case as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing occurs or such more recent practicable date prior to the Closing. Such estimates are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ " and the " _Estimated Net Debt_ ", respectively. For illustrative purposes only, attached hereto as Schedule I is a format to be used in determining the Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Net Debt. JetStar will make available to Basic all work papers and other books and records utilized in calculating Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Net Debt. The amount, if any, by which Estimated Net Working Capital is less than $5,000,000 (the " _Target Net Working Capital_ ") is the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit_ ", and the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital is the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Excess_." The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Debt exceeds $38,000,000 (the " _Target Net Debt_ ") is the " _Estimated Net Debt Deficit_ ", and the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Debt is less than the Target Net Debt is the " _Estimated Net Debt Excess_." At the Effective Time the Base Price shall be adjusted by the Estimated Closing Adjustment (as defined in _Section 2.5(d)_). 

  

 (b) _Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable but in any event within 90 days after the Closing, Basic will prepare a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, Basics calculation of the actual Net Working Capital as of the Closing and the actual Net Debt as of the Closing. The methodology used to calculate Net Working Capital and Net Debt on the Post-Closing Statement shall be the same as those on the Estimated Closing Statement. Basic shall deliver the Post-Closing Statement to the JetStar Stockholders Representative, and will also make available to the JetStar Stockholders Representative copies of all work papers and other books and records utilized in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement. The JetStar Stockholders Representative will have 20 days after receipt of the Post-Closing Statement to review such calculations and to reasonably object to same. Basic and the JetStar Stockholders Representative will resolve any dispute regarding such calculations as provided in _Section 9.7_. The Post-Closing Statement, either as prepared by 

   ##### 

  

    

Basic or as determined pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of
_Section 9.7_ , is the " _Final Closing Statement_." 

  

 (c) _Final Adjustments_. The consideration paid by Basic in connection with this Agreement will be adjusted based on the Final Closing Statement as follows: 

  

 (i) _Net Debt Adjustment_. If the Net Debt shown on the Final Closing Statement (the " _Final Net Debt_ ") is greater than the Estimated Net Debt the consideration payable by Basic in connection with this Agreement shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Final Net Debt minus the Estimated Net Debt. If the Final Net Debt is less than the Estimated Net Debt the consideration payable by Basic in connection with this Agreement shall be increased by an amount equal to the Estimated Net Debt minus the Final Net Debt. 

  

 (ii) _Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Statement (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ") is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the consideration payable by Basic in connection with this Agreement shall be increased by an amount equal to the Final Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Net Working Capital. If the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the consideration payable by Basic under this Agreement shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital minus the Final Net Working Capital. 

  

 (iii) _Netting_. The increases or decreases in the consideration payable by Basic determined under clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be netted against each other. Any net reduction in the consideration payable by Basic in connection with this Agreement after application of  _Section 2.5(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.5(c)(ii)_ shall be deducted from the Escrow Account and paid to Basic by the Escrow Agent at the time of delivery of the Final Closing Statement. Any net increase in the consideration payable by Basic in connection with this Agreement after application of _Section 2.5(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.5(c)(ii)_ will be paid to the former holders of JetStar Shares (excluding Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented thereby. Any such payments will be made to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) in cash and Basic Common Shares. The cash and Basic Common Shares payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated among the recipients thereof in the same manner as the right to receive payments of cash and Basic Common Shares was allocated among the holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) as of the Effective Time. Any payments made to Basic out of the Escrow Deposit shall be treated as a reduction in the consideration paid by Basic in connection with the Merger. Any payments made by Basic pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)(iii)_ shall be treated as an increase in the consideration paid by Basic in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (d) _Certain Defined Terms_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

 (i) " _Estimated Closing Adjustment_ " equals the Estimated Net Debt Excess, if any, plus the Estimated Net Working Capital Excess, if any, minus the Estimated Net Debt Deficit, if any, minus the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficit, if any. 

  

 (ii) " _GAAP_ " means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, consistently applied. In preparing the Post-Closing Statement, Basic shall not change the 

   ##### 

  

    

accounting principles used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement unless
a change is required to make the accounting principles in accordance with
GAAP. 

  

 (iii) " _Net Debt_ " means (A) the consolidated non-current liabilities of JetStar and its Subsidiaries as defined by GAAP and set forth on JetStars consolidated balance sheet, and including both the current and non-current portion of indebtedness for borrowed money (including any prepayment fees associated with the prepayment of the indebtedness described in Section 1.2(b)(i)(D) as of the Effective Time) and capitalized equipment lease obligations but excluding (1) up to $1,500,000 of deferred tax liabilities (net of deferred tax assets), (2) any sales, use or transfer Taxes accrued, or required to be accrued, by JetStar in connection with the Merger, and (3) any liabilities related to the obligations to make payments to Remaining Option Holders), minus (B) the consolidated cash of Jet Star and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (iv) " _Net Working Capital_ " means the consolidated total current assets (as defined by GAAP but excluding cash) of JetStar and its Subsidiaries _plus_ the HSR Fees paid by JetStar,  _plus_ amounts expended by JetStar or its Subsidiaries between the date hereof and the Closing for capital expenditures in accordance with the budget and capital expenditure schedule set forth on Schedule 5.1(b)(xii) of the JetStar Disclosure Letter or otherwise with the written consent of Basic, _plus_ any cash amounts to be withheld from the merger consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)_ as an offset for the satisfaction of the Option Loans  _minus_ total current liabilities (as defined by GAAP but (x) including (1) fees, expenses and disbursements of JetStar and its representatives incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are not paid prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, (2) the effect of the Merger on any liabilities of JetStar, including severance costs and change of control payments associated with employment or other contracts that are not paid prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time and (3) JetStars federal, state, local and other income, franchise, margin and other tax obligations due for tax periods ending on or before the Effective Date, and (y) excluding (1) the current portion of any indebtedness for borrowed money and capitalized lease obligations, (2) any sales, use or transfer Taxes accrued, or required to be accrued, by JetStar in connection with the Merger, and (3) any liabilities related to the obligations to make payments to Remaining Option Holders) of JetStar and its Subsidiaries. 

  

 SECTION 2.6 _APPRAISAL RIGHTS_. JetStar Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and has not consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL are referred to herein as " _Dissenting JetStar Shares_ ". Dissenting JetStar Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive the cash or Basic Common Shares under this Agreement, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the cash and Basic Common Shares such holder would have received in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Basic shall promptly provide to the Exchange Agent the cash and Basic Common Shares to which such former holder of Dissenting JetStar Shares shall be entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. JetStar shall give Basic prompt notice of any demands received by JetStar for appraisal of JetStar Shares. Except as required by applicable law or with the prior written consent of Basic, JetStar shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to 

   ##### 

  

    

settle, any such demands. Basic and Merger Sub agree that payments to any
holder of Dissenting JetStar Shares as a result of such holders exercise of
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be made from the
assets of the Surviving Entity and not from the assets of Basic or assets

JetStar is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in exposure to JetStar or its Subsidiaries of losses, damages or liabilities in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate. JetStar has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of JetStars certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Basic are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.

Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by JetStars stockholders. This
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of JetStar,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,

 SECTION 5.2 _NO SOLICITATION_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) JetStar agrees that, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Termination Date or the Effective Time, it (i) will not (and will not permit its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it, to) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a third party tender offer, merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving any assets or class of capital stock of JetStar, or any acquisition of the capital stock of JetStar or a business or assets (other than sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) of JetStar in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or any combination of the foregoing (any such proposal, offer or transaction being hereinafter referred to as a " _JetStar Acquisition Proposal_ ") or participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a JetStar Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any JetStar Acquisition Proposal; provided that, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent JetStar or its Board of Directors from (A) making any disclosure to the holders of JetStar Shares if in the good faith judgment of JetStars Board of Directors failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or (B) providing information (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that prevent JetStar from complying with its obligations under this _Section 5.2(a)_) to or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or group who has made an unsolicited bona fide JetStar Acquisition Proposal with respect to all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of JetStar or all or substantially all of the assets of JetStar if, with respect to the actions set forth in clause (B), (x) in the good faith judgment of JetStars Board of Directors, taking into account, among other things, the likelihood of consummation and after consultation with its financial advisors, such JetStar Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of JetStar Shares from a financial point of view than the Merger (a " _JetStar Superior Proposal_ ") and (y) the Board of Directors of JetStar, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. 

  

 (b) JetStar agrees that it will notify Basic promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if any proposal or offer relating to or constituting a JetStar Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, JetStar or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives. In connection with such notice, JetStar shall indicate the identity of the person or group making such request or inquiry or engaging in such negotiations or discussions and the material terms and conditions of any JetStar Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, JetStar shall keep Basic fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes, additions or adjustments to the terms of any such proposal or offer.

 (iv) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall be construed as a contract of employment, and this _Section 5.11_ shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employ of Basic or any of its Subsidiaries.

 (v) Nothing herein shall be construed to cause the employees of JetStar to be third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ or have any rights to enforce such provisions against the parties. 

   

 (c) Subject to satisfying Basics customary conditions to employment, Basic or one of its Subsidiaries shall offer all employees of JetStar and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time the opportunity to remain employed by JetStar or such Subsidiary or Basic of one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time at compensation levels substantially equivalent to the levels paid by Basic or its Subsidiaries to similar employees.

 (a) the Closing shall not have occurred by March 19, 2007; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.2 (a) _ shall not be available to any party whose failure or whose affiliates failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement in any manner shall have been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; or 

  

 (b) a governmental authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the enactment of any statute, rule, regulation, decree or executive order) permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action (including the enactment of any statute, rule, regulation, decree or executive order) shall have become final and non-appealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_ shall have complied with _Section 5.4_ and with respect to other matters not covered by _Section 5.4_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove such injunction, order or decree. 

  

 SECTION 7.3 _TERMINATION BY JETSTAR_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be terminated by JetStar, by written notice to Basic following an action of its Board of Directors, if: 

  

 (a) (i) there has been a breach by Basic or Merger Sub of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ would not be satisfied and (ii) such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given to Basic by JetStar; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be available to JetStar if it, at such time, is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ shall not be satisfied; 

  

 (b) at any time prior to the date that is 20 days after the date on which JetStar mails notice of obtaining the JetStar Requisite Consent to its stockholders who did not so consent, the Board of Directors of JetStar shall have withdrawn the Boards approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and recommended and declared advisable a JetStar Superior Proposal, or resolved to do the foregoing, after the Board shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to so withdraw its recommendation and recommend such JetStar Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law; provided that JetStar shall not have the right to terminate pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_ until it (i) shall have delivered to Basic written notice at least four Business Days prior to such termination of JetStars intention to terminate pursuant to this _Section 7.3(b)_, which notice shall state the most recent terms and conditions of the JetStar Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making the JetStar Superior Proposal, a copy of the definitive agreement proposed to be entered into in connection with the JetStar Superior Proposal; and (ii) shall have provided Basic with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiate in good faith with 

   ##### 

  

 

respect thereto during such four-Business Day period, so that such proposal
no longer constitutes a JetStar Superior Proposal, in which case JetStar
shall no longer have the right to terminate under this _Section 7.3(b)_ with
respect to such proposal. 

   

 SECTION 7.4 _TERMINATION BY BASIC_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be terminated by Basic, by action of its Board of Directors, if: 

  

 (a) (i) there has been a breach by JetStar of any representation, warranty covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ would not be satisfied and (ii) such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given by Basic to JetStar; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not be available to Basic if it, at such time, is in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ shall not be satisfied; or 

  

 (b) the Board of Directors of JetStar shall have withdrawn, modified, withheld or changed, in a manner adverse to Basic, the Boards approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommended that the holders of JetStar Shares accept the JetStar Superior Proposal, or resolved to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 7.5 _EFFECT OF TERMINATION_. If this Agreement is terminated: 

  

 (i) by JetStar pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_; or 

  

 (ii) by Basic pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_; 

 

then JetStar shall pay to Basic the Termination Amount (as defined below) and,
in addition, reimburse Basic for all expenses incurred by Basic in connection
with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount (as defined below)
prior to or upon termination of this Agreement. All payments under this
_Section 7.5_ shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an
account designated by Basic at the time of such termination. The term "
_Termination Amount_ " shall mean $3,500,000. The term " _Reimbursement
Maximum Amount_ " shall mean $250,000. JetStar acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.5_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Basic would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
JetStar fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.5_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Basic commences a suit which results in
a judgment against JetStar for the payment set forth in this _Section
7.5_, JetStar shall pay to Basic its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination
Amount and other amounts to be reimbursed to Basic under this _Section 7.5_
from the date payment was required to be made until the date of such payment
at the prime rate of interest as published in the _Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus one percent
(1%). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a provision that calls for
a payment to be made under this _Section 7.5_ , it shall not be a defense to
JetStars obligation to pay hereunder that this Agreement could have been
terminated under a different provision or could have been terminated at an
earlier or later time.   ##### 

  

  

   

ARTICLE 8 
 INDEMNIFIED BUYER LOSSES AND INDEMNIFIED JETSTAR LOSSES 

   

 SECTION 8.1 _INDEMNIFIED BUYER LOSSES_. From and after the Effective Time, JetStar shall no longer have any liability with regard to any representation or warranty of JetStar set forth in Article 3 or any breach by JetStar of, or the failure by JetStar to perform, any covenant or other agreement of JetStar to be performed by JetStar prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the limitations of this Article 8, including _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.6_, from and after the Closing, each Basic Indemnified Person will be indemnified and held harmless, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.2_, solely from the amounts in the Escrow Deposit (including any Escrow Earnings), from and against any Indemnified Buyer Losses. " _Indemnified Buyer Losses_ " shall mean any liabilities, losses, damages, demands, assessments, claims, costs and expenses (including interest, awards, judgments, penalties, settlements, fines, costs of remediation, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating and defending any claims or causes of action (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and all reasonable fees and expenses of consultants and other professionals)) actually suffered, incurred or realized by Basic, each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, stockholders and controlling Persons and their respective successors and assigns arising (a " _Basic Indemnified Person_ ") out of or resulting from or relating to (x) any breach of any representation or warranty of JetStar set forth in Article 3, (y) any breach by JetStar of, or the failure by JetStar to perform, any covenant or other agreement of JetStar to be performed by JetStar prior to the Closing, or (z) any Environmental Defect and related Environmental Remediation Costs. With respect to any Indemnified Buyer Losses potentially recoverable under an applicable policy or policies of insurance, (i) Basic or the Surviving Entity will make a claim with respect thereto under the applicable insurance policy or policies, and (ii) to the extent amounts paid to Basic from the Escrow Deposit in respect of Indemnified Buyer Losses are potentially recoverable under an applicable policy or policies of insurance, Basic and/or the Surviving Entity will, upon written request to do so, assign to the JetStar Stockholders Representative, for the benefit of the former stockholders of JetStar (other than holders of Dissenting JetStar Shares), any such claim or claims under such applicable policy or policies of insurance up to the amount so paid to Basic (with any additional recoveries being for the benefit of Basic). 

  

 SECTION 8.2 _LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFIED BUYER LOSSES_. 

  

 (a) If any Buyer Indemnified Person becomes potentially entitled to any indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1_ of this Agreement, the amount that such Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to recover in connection therewith shall nevertheless be limited as follows: 

  

 (i) first, no Indemnified Buyer Losses shall be payable until the total of all such Indemnified Buyer Losses exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only the excess amounts above the Deductible shall be recoverable by Buyer Indemnified Persons; and 

  

 (ii) second, the only available source of payment for any Indemnified Buyer Losses shall be up to $7,500,000 of the Escrow Deposit (plus any Escrow Earnings on such 

   ##### 

  

    

amount) held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to the extent such
funds have not yet been distributed to the former holders of JetStar Shares
under the terms hereof and/or the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (b) The former holders of JetStar Shares or the Cashed-Out Options, and the JetStar Stockholders Representative, individually or as a group, shall not have any personal liability for the payment of any indemnification obligations hereunder. 

  

 (c) Any claim for an Indemnified Buyer Loss must be made within one year after the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 8.3 _INDEMNIFIED JETSTAR LOSSES_. From and after the Closing Basic and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) or the Cashed-Out Options, the JetStar Stockholders Representative (in his capacity as such), and their respective directors, officers and employees (each a " _JetStar Indemnified Person_ " and, collectively, the " _JetStar Indemnified Persons_ ") for, from and against any Indemnified JetStar Losses arising out of (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of Basic or Merger Sub contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) the breach by Basic or Merger Sub of, or the failure by Basic or Merger Sub to perform, any of its or their covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement. " _Indemnified JetStar Losses_ " shall mean any liabilities, losses, damages, demands, assessments, claims, costs and expenses (including interest, awards, judgments, penalties, settlements, fines, costs of remediation, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating and defending any claims or causes of action (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and all reasonable fees and expenses of consultants and other professionals)) actually suffered, incurred or realized by any JetStar Indemnified Person. 

  

 SECTION 8.4 _LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFIED JETSTAR LOSSES_. 

  

 (a) If any JetStar Indemnified Person becomes potentially entitled to any indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.3_ of this Agreement (except with regard to any breach by Basic of its obligations pursuant to Article 2 or _Section 5.12(c)_, to which the limitations in this  _Section 8.4_ shall not apply), the amount that such JetStar Indemnified Person is entitled to recover in connection therewith shall nevertheless be limited as follows: 

  

 (i) first, no Indemnified JetStar Losses shall be payable until the total of all such Indemnified JetStar Losses exceeds the Deductible, and then only the excess amounts above the Deductible shall be payable; and 

  

 (ii) second, the maximum aggregate liability of Basic and Merger Sub for Indemnified JetStar Losses shall not exceed $7,500,000. 

  

 (b) Any claim for an Indemnified JetStar Loss must be made within one year after the Effective Time or, with respect to Article 2 or _Section 5.12(c)_, one year after the date when such payment is due to the extent later than the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) This _Section 8.4_ shall not limit any rights with respect to, or claim for damages for breach of, _Section 5.10_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 8.5 _PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMS_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 8, all claims for Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses under this Article 8 shall be asserted and resolved by either a Basic Indemnified Person or a JetStar Indemnified Person (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as follows: 

  

 (a) An Indemnified Person shall promptly give Basic or the JetStar Stockholders Representative, as applicable (each an " _Indemnifying Person_ ," as applicable) notice of any matter that such Indemnified Person has determined has given or could give rise to a claim for indemnification (a " _Claim Notice_ ") under this Article 8, stating the amount of the Indemnified Buyer Loss or Indemnified JetStar Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity, and stating with particularity the nature of such matter. Failure to provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification rights of such Indemnified Person hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have resulted in Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses that could have been actually avoided had such Claim Notice been provided within such required time period or to the extent such Claim Notice shall not have been sent within the time limitations set forth in this Article 8\. The Indemnifying Person shall, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Person in writing as to whether the Indemnifying Person admits or disputes the claim described in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Person gives written notice that it admits the indemnification claim described in such Claim Notice, then the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8, and subject to the limitations hereof, with respect to the estimated amount of Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses stated in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person in writing that it disputes such claim for indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 8 with respect thereto but disputes the amount of the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses in connection therewith, or if the Indemnifying Person fails to notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it either admits or disputes such claim for indemnification, then in either of such cases the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be a disputed indemnification claim that must be resolved by settlement between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, or by proceedings commenced in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, or by any other mutually agreeable method. 

  

 (b) If a claim is asserted against an Indemnified Person by a person other than a party to this Agreement and is based on factual allegations which, if true, would entitle the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder (any such claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person against whom the Third Party Claim is asserted shall give written notice (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of such Third Party Claim, describing in such notice in reasonable detail to the extent then known the nature of the Third Party Claim and the factual basis and circumstances surrounding same and estimating the amount of Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses attributable to such Third Party Claim to the extent feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of or binding as to the final amount of such indemnification claim). A copy of all papers served on or received by the Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party Claim, if any, shall be attached to the Third Party Claim Notice. The failure of an Indemnified Person to properly deliver a Third Party Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Person shall not defeat or prejudice the indemnification rights under this Article 8 of such Indemnified Person with respect to the related Third Party Claim 

   ##### 

  

 

unless and except to the extent that the resulting delay is materially
prejudicial to the defense of the Third Party Claim or the amount of
Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses associated therewith.
Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any Third Party Claim Notice with
respect to a Third Party Claim (the " _Election Period_ "), the Indemnifying
Person shall notify the Indemnified Person who provided the Third Party Claim
Notice in writing that the Indemnifying Person either (i) disputes the right
of the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 8 with
respect to that Third Party Claim, or (ii) admits the right of the
Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 8 with respect to
Indemnified buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses arising in connection
with that Third Party Claim. The failure of the Indemnifying person to
respond to the Indemnified Person within such fifteen (15) day period
after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice by the shall be deemed to
constitute a response by the Indemnifying Person that it denies the right of
such Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 8 with respect
to that Third Party Claim. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Person admits that an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under this Article 8 with respect to a Third Party Claim, then in such event (i) the Indemnifying Person shall defend the Third Party Claim with counsel approved by the Indemnified Person (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and if the Indemnifying Person is the JetStar Stockholders Representative, the reasonable costs of such defense incurred by the Indemnifying Person shall be paid from the Escrow Deposit, and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not enter into any settlement of the Third Party Claim unless such settlement is approved in writing by the Indemnified Person (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such asserted liability, shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Person in such defense and will attempt to make available on a reasonable basis to the Indemnifying Person all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof; provided that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there is one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Person. In any such case, the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related action in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, include the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel) for the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not elect to conduct the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified JetStar Losses shall include all reasonable costs and expenses of such defense as incurred by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party (and be entitled to participate) in such defense and attempt to make available to it on a reasonable basis all such witnesses, records, materials and information in its possession or under its control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Person disputes the right of the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 8 with respect to the Third Party Claim described in a Third Party Claim Notice, then in such event (i) the 

   ##### 

  

 

Indemnified Person may defend the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
and may enter into a settlement thereof without seeking or obtaining approval
of the Indemnifying Person as to counsel employed or for the making of such
settlement, and (ii) the amount of Indemnified Buyer Losses or Indemnified
JetStar Losses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with such
Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification
under this Article 8 with respect thereto, shall be a disputed
indemnification claim to be resolved by settlement between the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified Person, or by appropriate proceedings in any court
of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (d) Payment of all amounts determined pursuant to this Section 8.5 to be owed to a Basic Indemnified Person shall be made by only by the Escrow Agent, only to the extent contemplated by  _Section 2.4(a)_, in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ and the Escrow Agreement, and within ten (10) days after (i) the making of a binding settlement, or (ii) the expiration of all appeal rights from a final adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect thereto, or (iii) the final and non-appealable determination of such liability and amount by any other resolution method undertaken pursuant to the mutual written agreement of the Basic Indemnified Person and the JetStar Stockholders Representative. Payment of all amounts determined pursuant to this Section to be owed to a JetStar Indemnified Person shall be made by Basic, within ten (10) days after (i) the making of a binding settlement, or (ii) the expiration of all appeal rights from a final adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect thereto, or (iii) the final and non-appealable determination of such liability and amount by any other resolution method undertaken pursuant to the mutual written agreement of Basic and the JetStar Indemnified Person. Any such payment shall be paid to the JetStar Stockholders Representative for the account of such JetStar Indemnified Person, and shall be paid to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares), pro rata according to the number of Partially-Diluted JetStar Shares represented thereby; provided that any such payments will be made to the former holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) in cash and Basic Common Shares. The cash and Basic Common Shares payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be allocated among the recipients thereof in the same manner as the right to receive payments of cash and Basic Common Shares was allocated among the holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) as of the Effective Time. Any payments made to Basic out of the Escrow Deposit shall be treated as a reduction in the consideration paid by Basic in connection with the Merger. Any payments made by Basic pursuant to this _Section 8.5(d)_ shall be treated as an increase in the consideration paid by Basic in connection with the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 8.6 _EXCLUSIVE POST-CLOSING REMEDY_. After the Closing, and except for any non-monetary, equitable relief to which any Indemnified Person may be entitled, the rights and remedies set forth in this Article 8 shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the Indemnified Persons under or with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 8.7 _LIABILITY LIMITATIONS_. In no event shall any Indemnified Person be, under or in respect of this Agreement, entitled to recover indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages. Additionally, Basic, Merger Sub and JetStar hereby waive as to each former officer and director of JetStar, from and after the Closing, any and all claims and any causes of action for monetary damages under or with respect to the 

   ##### 

  

 

subject matter of this Agreement (other than any claims or causes of action
arising out of the express provisions of this Article 8) or, to the
extent liabilities with respect thereto would be subject to indemnification
as provided in the respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
organization documents of JetStar or its Subsidiaries or in any applicable
JetStar Material Contract, any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary
obligation by such officer or director to JetStar that Basic, Merger Sub or
JetStar might otherwise be entitled to assert against any such former officer
or director, including under any law.

request and which are available to that party or its Subsidiaries (or its
independent public accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity
to present to the Accountants any material relating to the determination and
to discuss the determination with the Accountants. Basic and the JetStar
Stockholders Representative will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accountants to deliver a final resolution of any disputed
amounts within 30 days of the date such issues were submitted to the
Accountants. The Accountants shall resolve such disputed amounts based solely
on the submissions of Basic and the JetStar Stockholders Representative, and
each item or amount in dispute must be resolved so that it falls within the
ranges presented to the Accountants. The determination by the Accountants
of the actual Net Working Capital and/or the actual Net Debt, as set forth in
a notice delivered to both parties by the Accountants will be binding and
conclusive (and such amounts will be the Final Net Working Capital and the
Final Net Debt for purposes of _Section 2.5(b)_). The party whose
calculation of Net Working Capital and Net Debt (on an aggregate basis) was
further from the sum of the Final Net Working Capital and Final Net Debt (as
determined by the Accountants) shall pay the fees and expenses of the
Accountants.

Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub (or its successors) to take any action prior to the Effective Time, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Basic to cause Merger Sub to take such action and a guarantee of the performance thereof.

 SECTION 9.16 _JETSTAR STOCKHOLDERS  REPRESENTATIVE_. 

  

 (a) A single individual (the " _JetStar Stockholders  Representative_"), shall represent the holders of JetStar Shares (other than Dissenting JetStar Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time and Cashed-Out Options (collectively, the " _Former JetStar Holders_ "). The Stockholders Representative shall be appointed (and may be removed and replaced) by JetStar Investment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The JetStar Stockholders Representative shall have the power and authority to act for all purposes under this Agreement on behalf of all of the Former JetStar Holders. The initial JetStar Stockholders Representative, who shall serve as such until replaced as provided herein, is Clark R. Crosnoe. Written notice of a replacement of the JetStar Stockholders Representative shall be given by the Person entitled to appoint such member to Basic. Each Former JetStar Holder shall be deemed at the Effective Time to have irrevocably appointed the JetStar Stockholders Representative as his, her or its attorney-in-fact and agent to act for such Former JetStar Holder as set forth herein. Basic and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on the written instructions of the JetStar Stockholders Representative and shall be protected from any liability of any kind for actions taken in reliance upon such written instructions. 

  

 (b) The JetStar Stockholders Representative shall make its decisions and take its actions or inactions based on the JetStar Stockholders Representatives determination, in its sole and absolute discretion, of what is in the best interest of the Former JetStar Holders under all circumstances. The JetStar Stockholders Representative shall be immune from any personal liability whatsoever with respect to actions or inactions taken or not taken on behalf of the Former JetStar Holders except for affirmative actions taken in bad faith and, to the extent an improper personal benefit is gained, for the intended personal benefit of the JetStar Stockholders 

   ##### 

  

    

Representative at the expense of the Former JetStar Holders. If a claim is
asserted against the JetStar Stockholders Representative in connection with
any action or inaction taken or not taken by it as agent for the Former
JetStar Holders, it shall be entitled to full and complete indemnification
from the Former JetStar Holders to the maximum extent permitted to a director
of JetStar under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of JetStar in
existence immediately prior to the Closing. Any such amounts shall be paid
from funds otherwise payable to the Former JetStar Holders under this
Agreement or in connection herewith that are held by the Escrow Agent after
the satisfaction of all indemnification claims made and such potential claims
that may be made under Article 8\. The JetStar Stockholders Representative
shall have the right to refrain from taking any action if such person
believes such funds may not be sufficient pending its request for agreements
and funds from Former JetStar Holders for the provision of additional funds
for such purpose and a response thereto acceptable to the JetStar
Stockholders Representative. 

  

 (c) Any costs or expenses incurred by the JetStar Stockholders Representative in his capacity as such under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the JetStar Stockholders Representative, shall be paid (or reimbursed) from amounts due to the Former JetStar Holders from the Escrow Deposit or, in the event no amounts remaining in the Escrow Deposit are to be distributed to the former holders of JetStar Shares, from amounts (not to exceed $100,000 in the aggregate) due to Basic from the Escrow Deposit. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any such amounts due to the JetStar Stockholders Representative shall be withheld from amounts otherwise due to the Former JetStar Holders prior to distribution to such Former JetStar Holders. Basic shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay (through advancement, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor) such fees and expenses, upon the reasonable request of the JetStar Stockholders Representative from time to time; provided that the aggregate amount of advances shall not exceed $100,000 at any time outstanding. The JetStar Stockholders Representative shall have the right to refrain from taking any action if such person believes such funds may not be sufficient pending its request for agreements and funds from Former JetStar Holders for the provision of additional funds for such purpose and a response thereto acceptable to the JetStar Stockholders Representative. The provisions of this _Section 9.16(c)_ shall not reduce the right of the JetStar Stockholders Representative to recover costs and expenses incurred by the JetStar Stockholders Representative in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim as contemplated by _Section 8.5(c)(i)_. 

  

 SECTION 9.17 _NO THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY_. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named parties hereto. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto; and no officer, director, stockholder, employee or affiliate of any party hereto (including any person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or tort) that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement (including a representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement).
