directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of

 



      
 

 



 

incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 



 

(b) _Officers_. The Parties will take all necessary actions so that at the
Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the
officers of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly
appointed.

 



 

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following will occur:

 



 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate representing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Owned Company
Shares** ") will be cancelled without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor; and

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to $32.00, without interest thereon (the "
**Per Share Price** "), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or
in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.11).

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 2.7(b) will
be construed to permit the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
Company Stockholders who have (A) neither voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (B) properly made a demand
for appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and has neither effectively withdrawn, failed to
perfect, waived, or otherwise lost such stockholders right to appraisal (the
" **Dissenting Company Shares** ") will not be converted into, or represent
the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such
Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive the Per Share Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.

 



 

(ii) _Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal_. The Company will give
Parent prompt notice (and in any event within one Business Day) of receiving
any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals or attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.
Parent will have the right to direct and control all negotiations and Legal
Proceedings with respect to any such demands, withdrawals or attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other Legal Proceedings in respect of the
appraisal rights of the Company Stockholders, except that, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent will consult with the Company and consider in good
faith the Companys advice with respect to such negotiations and proceedings
and the Company will have the right to participate in any such negotiations
and proceedings. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent may be given, conditioned or withheld in Parents sole
discretion), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(i) _Vested Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock-Based Award
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
vested and, if applicable, unexercised, will, without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the
Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share, if any, attributable to
such Company Stock-Based Award) by

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock-Based Award (the " **Company Stock-Based Award Consideration**
").

 



 

(ii) _Unvested Awards Subject to Only Time Vesting._ At the Effective Time,
each Company Stock-Based Award outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent subject to vesting conditions based solely on
continued employment or service to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and,
if applicable, unexercised, will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Company Stock-Based Award Consideration in respect of such unvested
and, if applicable, unexercised Company Stock-Based Award, payable on or
following the applicable vesting date (but not later than the first payroll
date following such applicable vesting date) as set forth in Section 2.8 of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent will not assume, substitute or convert any Company Stock-
Based Award that is outstanding, and, if applicable, unexercised, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a nonemployee member of
the Company Board.

 



 

(iii) _Unvested Awards Subject to Performance Vesting_. For purposes of this
Section 2.8(a), and notwithstanding anything contained in the Company Stock
Plan or any award agreement to the contrary, with respect to each Company
Stock-Based Award, the vesting of which is conditional in whole or in part on
the achievement of performance goals during a performance period that is still
outstanding as of the date hereof (each, a " **Performance Company Stock-Based
Award** ") that was granted after August 22, 2013, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the applicable performance metrics shall be deemed to have
been satisfied as to 100% of the target number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Performance Company Stock-Based Award, regardless of
when the performance period ends. For each Performance Company Stock-Based
Award granted on or after December 1, 2015, such Performance Company Stock-
Based Award shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 2.8(a)(ii) of
this Agreement, and each other Performance Company Stock-Based Award shall be
treated in the manner set forth in Section 2.8(a)(i) of this Agreement. For
each Performance Company Stock-Based Award granted on August 22, 2013, such
Performance Company Stock-Based Award shall be treated in accordance with its
terms. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the holder of such
Performance Company Stock-Based Award terminates his service to the Company
before the Effective Time, the outstanding and unvested portion of a
Performance Company Stock-Based Award as of immediately prior to the
termination date will be forfeited.

 



 

(iv) _Withholding; 409A_. The payment of the Company Stock-Based Award
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.8(a), with respect to any
Company Stock-Based Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of the Company
Stock-Based Award Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.8(a) would
otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under
the Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not result in
the imposition of such Tax or penalty.

 



   

     
 

 



 

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Option) by (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option
(the " **Option Consideration** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Company Options, whether vested or unvested, for which the
exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the
Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures for Vested Equity_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but no later than the second payroll date after the
Effective Time), the applicable holders of vested and, if applicable,
exercisable, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options will receive a
payment (without interest) from the Company or the Surviving Corporation
(which amounts Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, to the extent
that Company cash as of the Closing is insufficient to fund the payment of
such amounts, with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, at or prior to the Closing), through its payroll system or payroll
provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of
such vested Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options that are cancelled
and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment owed to a holder of vested
Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or
Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving
Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder, which check
will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the
Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter).

 



 

(d) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to effect
the cancellation of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options as of the
Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the
satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act). All Company Stock-Based Awards and all Company Stock Plans will
terminate as of the Effective Time, and the provisions in any other Company
Benefit Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be cancelled as of the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, no participant in any Company Stock Plan or Company Benefit
Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities
(including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the
Effective Time and not later than the day immediately prior to the date on
which the first offering period that is regularly

 



      
 

 



 

scheduled to commence under the ESPP after the date of this Agreement, the
Company will take all necessary actions, including obtaining any necessary
determinations or resolutions of the Company Board (or a committee thereof),
if appropriate, and amending the terms of the ESPP as may be necessary or
required under the ESPP and applicable Laws, to (i) to provide that each
individual participating in the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in
progress on the date of this Agreement (the " **Final Offering** ") will not
be permitted to (A) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to
the ESPP from the rate in effect when that Purchase Period commenced; or (B)
make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date
of this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law; (ii) ensure
that, except for the Final Offering, no offering period under the ESPP will be
authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement; (iii) if the
Closing will occur prior to the end of the Final Offering, provide each
individual participating in the Final Offering with notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date; (iv) cause the Final
Offering to end no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date; (v)
make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened
Final Offering Purchase Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Final
Offering Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed Purchase Period
for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (vi) cause each ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the ESPP to be used to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Final
Offering; (vii) provide that the applicable purchase price for Company Common
Stock will not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as of the
date of this Agreement; and (viii) ensure that no further rights are granted
under the ESPP after the Effective Time. Immediately prior to and effective as
of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the
Company will terminate the ESPP.

 



 

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent will select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent
for the Merger (the " **Payment Agent** "); and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub will
enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. (i) At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.7(a) an amount of cash that, when taken together with
the amount to be deposited by the Company pursuant to clause (ii) below, is
sufficient in the aggregate for the Payment Agent to make the payments of the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a); and (ii) at the Closing, after all of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, each
of which is capable of being satisfied at Closing) or waived (if permissible
under applicable Law) and Parent has confirmed in writing that it will
consummate the Closing, then the Company will, in consultation with and in
accordance with the directions having been given by Parent, deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.7(a), an amount of cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries designated by Parent (such designation to be made no

 



      
 

 



 

less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date), which amount shall
not exceed the Available Cash Amount. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (A)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (B) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; (C) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available); or (D) money market funds
investing solely in a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the " **Exchange Fund** "). To the extent that (1) there are
any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (2) the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a);
or (3) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or
the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7(a) for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash
in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a). Any
interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

 



 

(c) _Exchange and Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause
the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the " **Certificates** ")
whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a), (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Upon
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in
accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of
such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of
shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by
(2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The
Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may

 



      
 

 



 

impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder
of the Certificates on the amount payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only
the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7(a).

 



 

(ii) _Uncertificated Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ") will not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to
receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.7(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a) will, upon
receipt of an "agents message" in customary form (it being understood that
the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such
Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an "agents message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the
Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender
of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so
surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Any Per Share Price paid upon
surrender of an Uncertificated Share will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Uncertificated Share.

 



 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the
objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such
amount, the " **DTC Payment** "); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit
the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to
Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date
on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

 



 

(h) _Cash Balances_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, upon request and no
later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, a written
notice setting forth, in each case as of the close of business on the
immediately preceding Business Day, the aggregate cash balances held by the
Company and its Subsidiaries (by Subsidiary and by jurisdiction) as well as
the amounts of such cash balances that are not being used for other purposes
and that are available to be utilized in respect of the obligations set forth
in Section 2.8(c) and Section 2.9(b) (the " **Available Cash Amount** ").

 



 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will

 



      
 

 



 

automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of
Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance
with Section 2.7(a) (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights
pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of
Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7(a). Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



 

2.13 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company
and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all
such lawful and necessary action.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in (a) the Filed Company SEC Documents (excluding any
disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors", "Forward-Looking
Statements", "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and
any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of information, factors
or risks, or any other sections relating to forward-looking statements

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent that they are predictive or forward-looking in nature) it being
understood that (i) any matter disclosed in such filings shall not be deemed
disclosed for purposes of Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4,
or Section 3.5; and (ii) any matter disclosed in the Filed Company SEC
Documents will be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such
Filed Company SEC Documents that it is applicable to such section of the
Company Disclosure Letter; and (b) the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to
Section 1.4), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct.

 



 

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good
standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except
where the failure to be in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite
power and authority and possesses all Company Permits, except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to possess such Company Permits
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction

sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true, correct and complete
list identifying each material Company Benefit Plan. The Company has made
available true, correct and complete copies of (i) all material Company
Benefit Plans or, in the case of any unwritten material Company Benefit Plan,
a description thereof and, in each case, to the extent applicable, all
amendments thereto; (ii) other than with respect to Company Benefit Plans
primarily for the benefit of non-U.S. employees, the most recent annual report

recent summary plan description for each material Company Benefit Plan for
which such summary plan description is required; (iv) each trust agreement and
group annuity contract relating to any material Company Benefit Plan; (v) the
most recent financial statements and actuarial reports for each material
Company Benefit Plan (if any); and (vi) all material written communications to
any Governmental Authority relating to such material Company Benefit Plan made
within the last year. For the purposes of this Section 3.9(a), an agreement or
arrangement with a consultant who is a natural person will not be considered
material unless the Company and its Subsidiaries paid such consultant more
than $150,000 on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) _Qualified Status_. All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be
qualified and exempt from federal income Taxes under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a), respectively, of the Code have been the subject of or have

from the IRS to the effect that such Company Benefit Plans and the trusts
created thereunder are so qualified and tax-exempt, and no such determination
letter has been revoked nor (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, has
revocation been threatened; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
qualification or exemption; and (iii) has any such Company Benefit Plan been
amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or application
therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs.

 



 

(c) _Pension Plans_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has,
during the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement, maintained,
contributed to or been required to contribute to any Company Pension Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied liability
under Title IV of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that is reasonably likely to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur a liability under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has, or within the six-year period ending on the
date of this Agreement has had, contributed to, been required to contribute
to, or has or within the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement
has had any obligation or liability (including "withdrawal liability" within
the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) with respect to,

 



      
 

 



 

any Company Multiemployer Plan. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4063 or Section 4064 of ERISA).
There does not now exist nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, do any
circumstances exist that are reasonably likely to result in any Controlled
Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or any of its

or trusts have been terminated, nor is there any intention or expectation to

trusts are the subject of any proceeding by any Person, including any
Governmental Authority, that could be reasonably expected to result in a
termination of any Company Benefit Plan or trust; and (iii) event has occurred

reasonably expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Laws.

 



 

(e) _Ability to Amend_. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan, such Company Benefit Plan (including any
Company Benefit Plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be
amended subject to applicable Law to reduce benefits or limit the liability of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or terminated, in each case, without material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the
Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Absence of Certain Plan Terms_. No Company Benefit Plan provides health,
medical or other welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of
employment (other than for continuation coverage required under Section
4980(B)(f) of the Code or applicable Law) in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) _Compliance with Law_. Except for matters that would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Benefit Plan and its related trust,

amended, funded, invested, maintained and administered in accordance with its
terms and is in compliance with ERISA (if applicable), the Code and all other
Laws applicable to such Company Benefit Plan; and (ii) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws
applicable to the Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(h) _Absence of Claims_. Except for matters that would not have a Company

are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims, audits
or inquiries by, on behalf of or against any participant in any of the Company
Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan or the
assets of any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(i) _Absence of Effects of the Merger_. None of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the obtaining of the Requisite Stockholder Approval or the
consummation of the Merger (alone or in conjunction with any other event,
including any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time)
will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or

 



      
 

 



 

Independent Contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
trigger or increase any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits,
or trigger any other obligation, under any Company Benefit Plan; or (iii)
result in any breach or violation of, default under or limit the Companys
right to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(j) _Section 280G/4999_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Merger will (either alone or in combination with
another event) result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or
in combination with any other such payment, (i) not be deductible as a result
of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of foreign, state
or local Law relating to Tax); or (ii) be subject to the excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code. The Company has provided to Parent (A) its

foreign, state or local Law relating to Tax).

 



 

(l) _Section 409A_. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
that is subject to Section 409A of the Code is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(m) _Contributions_. All contributions required to be made to any Company
Benefit Plan by applicable Law, any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date of
this Agreement have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been
fully reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents. Each Company Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded
through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with

(p) _Additional Company Benefit Plans_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any formal plan or has made any enforceable promise or
commitment to create any additional benefit plans which would be considered to
be a material Company Benefit Plan once created or to improve or change the
benefits in any material respect provided under any material Company Benefit
Plan or any other Company Benefit Plan that would be a material Company
Benefit Plan as a result of such improvements or changes.

 



 

(q) _Prohibited Transactions_. Neither the Company, any Company Benefit Plan
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other
third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof has engaged in any
breach of fiduciary responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) to which
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and which would
reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any
Company Benefit Plan to any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed
by Section 4975 of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of Law).

 



 

3.10 _Litigation; Orders_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the

4.5(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or controlled
Affiliates (i) beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3

been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and, prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub will have engaged in any other
business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other

Agreement. Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding

based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

 



 

4.9 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantors, enforceable against the applicable
Guarantor in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and, as to enforceability, by general
principles of equity. No event has occurred that (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, constitute
a default on the part of any Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

 



 

4.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) _Financing Letters_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of (i) an executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, between Parent and
the Guarantors (the " **Equity Commitment Letter** ") pursuant to which the
Guarantors have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set forth therein
for the purpose of funding a portion of the aggregate value of the
consideration payable in the Merger (the " **Equity Financing** "); and (ii)
executed commitment letters, dated as of the date of this Agreement, among
Parent, Merger Sub and the lenders party thereto (the " **Debt Commitment
Letters** " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " **Financing
Letters** ") pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have

 



      
 

 



 

committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts
set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the aggregate value
of the consideration payable in the Merger (the " **Debt Financing** " and,
together with the Equity Financing, the " **Financing** "). Parent has also
delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of any fee letter
(which may be delivered with the fee amounts, "flex" terms and other economic
terms redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that
would adversely affect the amount (below the Required Amount), conditionality,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing) in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letters (any such letter, a " **Fee Letter** "). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third party
beneficiary thereof in connection with the Companys exercise of its rights
under Section 9.8(b).

 



 

(b) _No Amendments_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Financing
Letters have not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement;
(ii) no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, by the other parties thereto (other than to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this
Agreement); and (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded,
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. There are no other
Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters, any Fee Letters, any customary credit letters or any
customary engagement letters.

 



 

(c) _Sufficiency of Financing_. Assuming (w) the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Financing Letters, (x) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III hereof
and (y) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Financing, together with the
Available Cash Amount, is sufficient to satisfy Parents obligations hereunder
to (i) make all payments contemplated to be made by Parent under this
Agreement in connection with the Merger (including the payment of all amounts
payable by Parent pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of
the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to the
Merger) the principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness
outstanding pursuant to, the Credit Agreement and the Notes Indenture; and
(iii) pay all fees and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Financing (such amount,
the " **Required Amount** ").

 



 

(d) _Validity_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters (in
the forms delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with respect
to the Equity Commitment Letter, Guarantor), as applicable, enforceable
against Parent, Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their terms and conditions, except,
in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and, as to enforceability,
by general principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters and any Fee Letter, there are no

 



      
 

 



 

conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
proceeds of the Financing (including any "flex" provisions) pursuant to any
agreement relating to the Financing to which Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any counterparty to
the Financing Letters has committed any breach of any of its covenants or
other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any of the Financing
Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i)
constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of any Person under
any of the Financing Letters; (ii) constitute or result in a failure to
satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing
Letters; or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being
available. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Merger, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after
giving effect to any "flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment Letters) that
(A) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such term or condition is
contained in the Financing Letters; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant
to the Financing Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms
or conditions contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are
satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully
paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees that are due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of
the Financing Letters. Other than as set forth in the Financing Letters, there
are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing.

 



 

(e) _Exclusive Arrangements_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the
Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has
entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any
agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) prohibiting
or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider
of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or
financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger.

 



 

4.11 _Absence of Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. As of the date of
this Agreement, other than the Voting Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract with any
stockholder, director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or
(ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or
operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the
Effective Time; or (b) pursuant to which any (i) holder of Company Common
Stock would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or
nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such holders shares of Company
Common Stock; (ii) holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this
Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) Person other than
Guarantor has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, an equity investment
to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

4.12 _Interests in Competitors_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates owns any interest in
any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from products,
services or lines of business within the Companys principal products,
services or lines of business.

 



 

4.13 _Solvency_. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger, the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, and
after giving effect to the Merger and the payment of the amounts payable
pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Letters, as of the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation will be
Solvent.

 



 

4.14 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub,
on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and

upon by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives as having been authorized by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Affiliates or Representatives
(or any other Person); and

 



 

(iii) the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement
are in lieu of and are exclusive of all other representations and warranties,
including any express or implied or as to merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose, and the Company hereby disclaims any other or implied
representations or warranties, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to

any documentation or other information (including any financial information,
supplemental data or financial projections or other forward-looking
statements).

 



 

(b) _No Reliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in Article III, it is not acting (including, as
applicable, by entering into this Agreement or consummating the Merger) in
reliance on:

 



 

(i) any representation or warranty, express or implied;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information,

Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "); (vi) fail to
enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law, it being understood that, in such instance, the Company will
not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of
any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such provision
prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the
Company Board (or any committee thereof); or (vii) authorize or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section
5.3, from the date of this Agreement until the Companys receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor), following the

 



      
 

 



 

execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with; (ii) furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; or (iii)
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, in each case, any Person or its Representatives that has made
or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement that was not solicited in breach of Section 5.3(a), but
only if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (B) the
failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company will substantially
contemporaneously make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
Parent.

 



 

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at no time after
the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee thereof):

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub; (B) adopt, approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal;
(C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10
Business Days of the occurrence of a material event or development and after
Parent so requests in writing (or, if the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to be held within 10 Business Days, then within one Business Day
after Parent so requests in writing); (D) take or fail to take any formal
action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender
or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop,
look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern
time, on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being
considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (A) through (E), a " **Company Board Recommendation Change** "), it
being understood that neither (1) the determination in itself by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; nor (2) the delivery in
itself by the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d)
will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section
5.3; or

 



 

(ii) cause, permit or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(i) other than in connection with a written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable Law if and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which notice will
describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

 



 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such five Business Day period, have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the
Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect
thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); or

 



 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a
Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in each case if and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law;

 



 

(2) the Company has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; and

 



 

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance (the " **Notice Period** ") to the effect that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that has not been

 



      
 

 



 

withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(ii),
which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making
such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and
copies of all relevant documents (including the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be
consummated) relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company
and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make
a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any
material revision, amendment, update or supplement to such Acquisition
Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3) with
respect to such new written notice (with the "Notice Period" in respect of
such new written notice being three Business Days from the date of such
notice); and (b) no Company Board Recommendation Change or termination will be
permitted by the Company unless, at the end of the Notice Period, the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) has in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that
such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2)
Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, by the later of
(i) 24 hours from the receipt thereof or (ii) 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the
next Business Day) notify Parent in writing if any Acquisition Proposal, or
inquiry from any Person or Group related to making a potential Acquisition
Proposal, is, to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will
include the members of the Company Board and will not be deemed to be only as
of the date of this Agreement), received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal, inquiry,
request or offer (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms
of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect
on the date of this Agreement); and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if writing, a copy
thereof. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals
(including any updates or amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. So long as the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other than in a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act):

 



      
 

 



 

(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
including making a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication); (B) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; (C) informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 5.3; or (D) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law; and

 



 

(ii) it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a
factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof), after the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such factually accurate public statement
would be reasonably expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law,
that (A) describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B)
identifies the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal; (C) provides
the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (1)
a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification or modification, or
proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption,
approval or recommendation with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a
Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



 

(g) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any action taken by a
Representative of the Company (other than an employee or consultant of the
Company who is not an executive or other officer of the Company) that, if
taken by the Company, would constitute a material breach of this Section 5.3
will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.3.

 



 

5.4 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. Without limiting in any way
any Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement (including Section
5.2), the Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in
this Agreement are not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the business or operations of the other at any time prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company will exercise, consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective
businesses and operations.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

6.1 _Efforts; Required Action and Forbearance_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions

Company, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to (A) take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (B) do (or cause to be done)
all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or
advisable pursuant to applicable Law (including Antitrust Law) or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger, including by using reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied;

 



 

(ii) (1) seek to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities; and (2) make all registrations,

Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to seek to maintain and
preserve the benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Material Contracts
as of and following the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neither Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any
action (or fail to take any action) that is intended to or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of preventing, impairing, delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting the (i) consummation of the Merger; or (ii)
ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with Section 5.3 will be considered a violation of this Section
6.1.

 



 

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled Affiliates, if

applicable to the Merger. If any Party receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger, then such Party will use its reasonable best efforts
to make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. The filing fees associated with any required filing or
submission under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law will be
borne 50% by the Company and 50% by Parent.

separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting
interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (B) any other restrictions
on the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) contest,
defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will Parent or Merger
Sub be obligated pursuant to this Agreement, and the Company will not without
the prior written consent of Parent, to (1) sell, divest, license or hold
separate any capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses; or (2) to
take, or commit to take any action that, in each case, would be reasonably
likely to (a) materially adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived
by Parent as a result of the Merger; or (b) impose material limitations on the
ownership by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of all or a material portion of
the Companys business or assets.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub will (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, (i)
promptly notify the other Parties of (and, if in writing, furnish them with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise them of the contents
of)) any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the other Parties to review
and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal

analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and any developments,
meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof,
including with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver; (B) the expiration of any waiting
period; (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any
investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding
under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised
or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting,
hearing, proceeding or discussions with or before any Governmental Authority
in respect of the Merger without giving the other Parties reasonable prior
notice of such meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussion, and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. However, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate
any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such information will not be
shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of the
Party providing the non-public information. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub may redact any valuation and related information before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an
"outside counsel" only basis.

 



 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation_. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement the Company
will prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a
preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the Company Stockholders in
connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting (the proxy statement,
including any amendments or supplements, the " **Proxy Statement** "), and
will use its reasonable best efforts to so prepare and file the preliminary
Proxy Statement within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement. The
Company will not file the Proxy Statement with the SEC without first providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,

all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent or its
counsel. Subject to Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company will (A) include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; and (B) use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments, if any, with
respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after the receipt
thereof. Following the later of (1) confirmation by the SEC that it has no
further comments or (2) expiration of the 10-day waiting period contemplated
by Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company will promptly
cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company
Stockholders as of the record date established for the Company Stockholder
Meeting, and will use its reasonable best efforts to do so within three
Business Days after the later of (1) or (2) above to occur.

 



 

(b) _Assistance_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will furnish all
information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other
Party to be included therein and will otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other in the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments to either received from the
SEC.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _SEC Correspondence_. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the
receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, or for
additional information, and will supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to such filings.

 



 

(d) _No Amendments to Proxy Statement_. Except in connection with a Company
Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without the approval of Parent,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(e) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an " **Other Required Company Filing** "), then the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NYSE.
Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter,
the Company may not file any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC
without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to,
and will consider in good faith, all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent or its counsel.

 



 

(f) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent or Merger Sub determines that it
is required to file any document with the SEC as a result of the Merger or the
Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable Law (an " **Other Required
Parent Filing** "), then Parent and Merger Sub will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required
Parent Filing with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub will cause any Other
Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub may file any Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC
without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon, and Parent will give due consideration to, and
consider in good faith, all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested by the Company or its counsel.

 



 

(g) _Accuracy; Supplied Information_.

 



 

(i) _Company_. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company
Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by
the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation

 



      
 

 



 

by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Parent Filings will
not, at the time that such Proxy Statement or Other Required Parent Filing is
filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

 



 

(ii) _Parent_. On the date of filing, no Other Required Parent Filing will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent
Filing. The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy
Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

necessary in accordance with applicable Law, the Charter, the Bylaws and the
rules of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (including any
adjournment, postponement or other delay thereof, the " **Company Stockholder
Meeting** ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of
the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders (as contemplated by Section
6.3(a)) for the purpose of (i) seeking the Requisite Stockholder Approval to

Company Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request
from the SEC; (iii) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined

Law) in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by
issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise. Without
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company Stockholder Meeting will not
be postponed or adjourned (A) by more than 10 calendar days at a time without
the prior written consent of Parent; or (B) with respect to Section 6.4(b)(i),

of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
pursuant to, the Financing Letters (or any related fee letters or engagement
letters) if such amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be
expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount
below the Required Amount (unless the Equity Financing is increased by an
equivalent amount); (ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or
prevent the Closing; or (B) materially delay or prevent funding of the
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing;
or (iii) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto (it being understood that Parent
may amend any Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who had not executed
such Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement). Any reference
in this Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or modified in compliance
with this Section 6.5; and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment
Letters" or "Financing Letters" will include such documents as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 6.5.

 



 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and to do (or cause to
be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required, the
full exercise of any "flex" provisions) described in the Financing Letters and
any related Fee Letter (or on other terms that, with respect to
conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters),
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Financing Letters in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and
conditions (which may include the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and related Fee Letter (or on other terms that, with
respect to conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent than the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing
Letters); (iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "flex"
provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Debt Financing
to the extent that such "flex" provisions are exercised in accordance with the
terms thereof; (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that
are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letters and
such definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter that
are within their control (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver
of conditions applicable to Parent contained in such Financing Letters); (v)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing
at the Closing; (vi) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Financing
Letters; and (vii) enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters.
Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when
they become due.

 



 

(c) _Information_. Parent will, upon the request of the Company, promptly, and
in any event within two Business Days, (i) update the Company in reasonable
detail on the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing; and (ii) provide
the Company with copies of all executed definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub must also give the Company prompt
notice, and in any event within two Business Days, (A) of any breach (or
threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware;
(B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual breach
(or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any party to
the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of
any provisions of the Financing Letters or such definitive agreements that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing; or
(2) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing; and (C) the
occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the terms
and in the manner contemplated by the Financing Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Parent must provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the any of the circumstances
referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in
any event with two Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a
written request therefor to Parent.

 



 

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, then Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from alternative sources

 



      
 

 



 

on terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) not less favorable
to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters
and any Fee Letters (after taking into account any "flex" provisions included
in any related Fee Letter) and in an amount sufficient to fund the Required
Amount or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "
**Alternate Debt Financing** "); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment
letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " **New Debt
Commitment Letters** "), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the
existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly
provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in
connection therewith, which may be delivered with the fee amounts, "flex"
terms and other economic terms therein redacted in a customary manner so long
as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount (below the
Required Amount), conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate
Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment
Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing
Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or the "Debt Financing" will mean the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

 



 

(e) _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 will require, and in no event
will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement
action against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its rights
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (but without prejudice to or
limitation of the right of the Company to specific performance in connection
with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded,
in accordance with and subject to, the terms and conditions of, Section
9.8(b)); (ii) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than a
counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Commitment Letter; or (iii) pay any material fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter.

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any

liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with

to result in personal liability to such Representative; (2) the Company Board
to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Closing;
and (3) the Company and its Subsidiaries to take any action that would
conflict with or violate its organizational documents, any applicable Laws or

the Company or any of it is Subsidiaries is a party. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall
be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no
directors of the Company that will not be continuing directors, acting in such
capacity, shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement
with respect to the Financing.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Updates_. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts,
to update any Required Financing Information provided to Parent and the
Financing Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financing
Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth
in the definition of "Required Financing Information" and (iii) would not,
after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to cease
pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may, to most effectively access the financing markets, require the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.6 at any
time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof
and the Closing Date; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the
markets. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K and Form
10-Q, and to the extent required to include financial information pursuant to
Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to file all
other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time periods
required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing
effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent reasonably requests
the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act
that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines (and the Company does not
unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering memorandum for the
Debt Financing, then, the Company shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



 

(d) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing so long as such logos are
used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection with a
description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger; and (iii)
in a manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company
reasonably imposes.

 



 

(e) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound
by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to
other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
of which the Company is a beneficiary.

 



 

(f) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6.

 



 

(g) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent
from and against any and all

 



      
 

 



 

liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging
the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith (other than to the extent any of the
foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and its Subsidiaries or, in
each case, their respective Representatives). Parents obligations pursuant to
Section 6.6(f) and this Section 6.6(g) are referred to collectively as the "
**Reimbursement Obligations**."

 



 

(h) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will
be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into
any Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank or other potential
provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing
to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(i) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. Subject to
Section 9.8(b)(ii), if the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger
Sub will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.

 



 

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-
takeover" Law is or may become applicable to the Merger, take all action
within their power to ensure that such transactions, including the Merger, may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on such
transactions, including the Merger.

 



 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
(1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective
Time, the Company will and will cause its Representatives and Subsidiaries to,
afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable advance notice from Parent, to the properties, offices,
facilities, Contracts, Tax records, books and records and personnel of the
Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
any documents or information to the extent that the Company reasonably
determines that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information (so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information and
to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by Parent and its
Representatives based on such information on a basis that does not compromise
the Companys attorney-client or other privilege with respect thereto; or (c)
access to a Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate
or cause a default pursuant to,

 



      
 

 



 

or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights
pursuant to, such Contract (so long as the Company will have used reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such access and
disclosure); or (d) such documents or information are directly pertinent to
any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this
Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their respective Representatives to prepare any reports,
analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any
access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject
to the Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and
will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must be directed to
the Companys General Counsel or another person designated in writing by the
Company.

 



 

6.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by
each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.10 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective
current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, to the extent such indemnification agreements are substantially
consistent in all material respects with the form of indemnification agreement
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof), on the other hand (collectively,
the " **Indemnified Persons** "). In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as
of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions
may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as
required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of Section
6.10(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the Effective Time, each Indemnified Person from and against any
reasonable and documented costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to
(i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Persons capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and (ii) the
Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with
respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim
asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such
Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control
the defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) each Indemnified Person will
be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether
or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving
Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of
any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal
Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her
prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages
for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or
otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the DandO Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be

 



      
 

 



 

obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "
**Maximum Annual Premium** "). If the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in
lieu of maintaining the DandO Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the
Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid
"tail" policy (a " **Tail Policy** ") with respect to the DandO Insurance from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the
annual cost for a Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If
the Company purchases a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such a Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
its obligations thereunder for so long as such a Tail Policy is in full force
and effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provisions
will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all
of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
Section 6.10.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and their heirs and
representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or a Tail
Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person
or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and their
heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance
or a Tail Policy are intended to be, following the Effective Time, third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a
Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and their
heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance
or a Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant
to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of
the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements
entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable
Law.

 



 

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Change of Control Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of
the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements
in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will
prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one year following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain
for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans (other
than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to
Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the " **Company Plans** ") at benefit
levels that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect at
the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide
compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company
Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to Section
6.11(b), individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that,
taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
(" **Comparable Plans** "); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans
and Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in
equity-based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment
agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity
to participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements)
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity
will not be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time
for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. For a period of one
year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance benefits to
eligible full-time regular employees no less favorable than the Companys past
practices and severance calculation set forth on Section 6.11(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, without regard to the right to exercise discretion
to reduce such levels, taking into account service both before and after the
Closing.

 



 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such
Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement, but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension or retiree health plans), except that such service need not be
credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans)
(such plans, the " **New Plans** ") to the extent that coverage pursuant to
any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to
any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will undertake commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation will
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan;
and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New
Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account
of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time and will be
subject to the vacation policies of the Surviving Corporation as in effect
from time to time; provided, that vacation accrued but unused as of the
Closing shall remain available to the same extent as under Company programs in
effect as of the date hereof as applied to each Continuing Employee.

 



 

(e) _No Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.11 will not be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to the
limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11,
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) be deemed
or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or be deemed or construed to establish any Company Benefit Plan; or (iv)
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person.

 



 

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of

 



      
 

 



 

them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent:
(i) of any notice or other communication received by the Company from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
the Company to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent; (ii) of any Legal Proceedings commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
relate to the Merger; and (iii)(x) of any change, condition or event
(including any renewal, termination, or amendment of, or any proposed
modification to, any Material Contract) that to the Companys Knowledge would
render or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or
warranty made by it in this Agreement untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or (y) of any failure or reasonably anticipated failure by the
Company to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or
failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in
_Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ , _however_
, that the Companys unintentional failure to give any notice under Section
6.13(a)(iii) shall not be deemed a breach for purposes of the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(b)). No such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.13(a).

 



 

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with

becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger
Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions

 



      
 

 



 

of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).

 



 

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning

Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties
before, and will provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any communication when, (a) participating in any media
interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional
investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are

suppliers, customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually if approved by the
other Party); or (iii) principally related to a Superior Proposal or Company
Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates may provide ordinary course communications
regarding this Agreement and the Merger to existing or prospective general or
limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of such
Person.

the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the (1) valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will provide Parent with prompt
notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all
pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a) give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation; (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (c) consider in
good faith Parents advice with respect to any Transaction Litigation. The
Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or

(i) by the Company if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the

Closing) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions set forth

by the third Business Day after the delivery of the notice described in clause

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt
written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail
the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the
basis for such termination pursuant to such provision.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual written agreement
of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating
Party to the other Parties. Following the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect
without liability or obligation of any Party (or any direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party or
such Partys Affiliates or its or any of the foregoings successors or
assigns) except, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, Section 8.3,
Section 9.8 and Section 9.14 (in each case, including the limitations set
forth herein or therein), that the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), Section
6.6(f), Section 6.6(g), Section 6.14, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section
8.4, Section 8.5 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this
Agreement, in each case, in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, nothing in this Agreement
will relieve (i) the Company from any liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement; and (ii) the Company or (subject in all respects to this Section
8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.8 and Section 9.14 (in each case, including the
limitations set forth herein or therein)) Parent or Merger Sub from any
liability for its fraud prior to the valid termination of this Agreement (in
each of cases (i) and (ii), which the Parties acknowledge and agree will not
be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Parent Expenses), and in the case
of any damages sought by the non-breaching Party, including any willful
breach, such damages will include the benefit of the bargain lost by the non-
breaching Party, taking into consideration relevant matters, including
opportunity costs and the time value of money). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Parent Related Parties,
collectively, have any liability for monetary damages (including damages for
fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise or
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) in the aggregate in excess
of the Maximum Liability Amount and subject in all respects to the limitations
set forth in Section 8.3(g). No valid termination of this Agreement will
affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Guarantee or the Financing Letters, which rights, obligations
and agreements will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated. Expenses incurred in connection with the printing,
filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement will be shared equally by Parent and
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. If the
Merger is consummated, Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer,
stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property
transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in
connection with entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Company Payments_.

 



 

(i) _Future Transactions_. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e); (B) following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly announced or publicly disclosed or, in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) only, otherwise communicated to the Company; and
(C) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for
the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will,
concurrently with the earlier of the consummation of such Acquisition
Transaction and such entry into a definitive agreement, pay or cause to be
paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to $112,000,000 (the "
**Company Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of
this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to "15%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(ii) _Company Board Recommendation Change_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company must promptly (and in
any event within two Business Days) following such termination pay or cause to
be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent.

 



 

(iii) _Superior Proposal_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), then the Company must concurrently with such termination pay
or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(iv) _Company Breach_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then the Company must concurrently with such termination pay
or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to that required
to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all fees
and expenses (up to a maximum amount of $5,500,000) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Parent
Expenses** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(c) _Parent Payment_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) (and such material breach or material failure to perform by
Parent is or would be the primary cause of the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent must
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such
termination pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount
equal to $253,000,000 (the " **Parent Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Company.

 



 

(d) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee

 



      
 

 



 

or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company
Termination Fee (as well as the Parent Expenses) or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 8.3 will not constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or
Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment
against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion
thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section
8.3(c) or any portion thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying party will
pay or cause to be paid to the other party the reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) of the other party in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date
that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate
that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(i) _Company_. The Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the
extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including, without duplication, the
Companys right to enforce the Guarantee with respect thereto and receive the
Parent Termination Fee from the Guarantors), the Reimbursement Obligations and
the Companys right to specific performance pursuant to Section 9.8 will be
the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company against (A) Parent, Merger Sub,
the Guarantors or any Co-Investor; and (B) the former, current and future
holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Financing Sources, Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantors), members, managers, general or limited partners,
stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors and
any Co-Investors (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "
**Parent Related Parties** ") in respect of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters, the Guarantee and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related Parties will have
any further monetary liability or obligation to the Company relating to or
arising out of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

the Financing Letters, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates), as applicable,
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties, as applicable, may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Reimbursement Obligations, the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), Section 8.2,
Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), and the Guarantors will remain obligated
with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to
remedies with respect to the Guarantee (in each case subject to the terms and
conditions of the Guarantee)).

 



 

(ii) _Parent_. Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent
Expenses to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and Parents right to
specific performance pursuant to Section 9.8 will be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates
against (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "
**Company Related Parties** ") in respect of this Agreement and the Merger,
and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties will have
any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger (except that the Parties (or
their Affiliates), as applicable, will remain obligated with respect to, and
the Parties, as applicable, may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), Section 8.2,
Section 8.3(a), Section 8.3(b)(iv) and Section 8.3(e), as applicable).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii), and the payment of the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, will not relieve the Company from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, but subject to Section 9.8(b), the maximum aggregate
liability, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise,
together with any payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any other payment
in connection with any Transaction Document or otherwise, of the Parent
Related Parties collectively (including monetary damages for fraud or breach,
whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or monetary damages
in lieu of specific performance) (A) under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document; (B) in connection with the failure of the Merger
(including the Financing) or the other transactions contemplated hereunder or
under the Transaction Documents to be consummated; or (C) in respect of any
representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in connection
with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, will not exceed under
any circumstances an amount equal to (i) the Parent Termination Fee, if any,
due and owing to the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c), plus (ii) the
amounts, if any, due and owing under Section 8.3(e), if any, plus (iii) the
amounts, if any, due and owing to the Company pursuant to the Reimbursement
Obligations (collectively, the " **Maximum Liability Amount** "); _provided_ ,
that (A) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Parents obligations
described in clause (i) of this Section 8.3(g), together with the aggregate
amount of Parents and Merger Subs obligations described in clause (ii) of
the third sentence of Section 8.2(b), exceed the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee, and (B) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Parents
and Merger Subs obligations described in clause (ii) of this Section 8.3(g)
exceed $750,000, and in

 



      
 

 



 

no event will the Company, its Affiliates or any of the foregoings respective
Representatives seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent
Related Parties, or compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of, any
damages or other payments whatsoever (including multiple, consequential,
indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of the
Parent Termination Fee or any of the foregoing limitations in this Section
8.3(g) (as applicable).

 



 

(h) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 8.3(e), it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(b), except that, although the
Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies under
this Agreement, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with,
but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.8(b), under no circumstances will
the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both
specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.8(b) or any
monetary damages or other payments (including payment of the Parent
Termination Fee).

 



 

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof)), except that if the Company has received the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, then no amendment may be made to this
Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to
the DGCL without receiving such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources
set forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.3, Section
9.6, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11, Section 9.14 and this Section 8.4 (and the
defined terms used therein) may not be amended, modified or altered without
the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable;
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
Party in this Agreement; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit
of such Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right
pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any
Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Apollo Management VIII, L.P. and the Company have previously executed the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger

accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement,
each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their
Representatives to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.

 



 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Voting Agreement, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will
(a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c)
continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the (i)
Effective Time and (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and this
Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in
or contemplated by Section 6.10 and this Section 9.6; and (b) from and after
the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options to receive the merger
consideration set forth in Article II. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of (i) Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.8, Section 9.11, Section
9.14 and this Section 9.6, and the definitions of Maximum Liability Amount,
Parent Related Party and Related Party will inure to the benefit of the Parent
Related Parties, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries
thereof; and Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 8.4, Section
9.10(b), Section 9.11, Section 9.14 and this Section 9.6 will inure to the
benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of
whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood
and agreed that Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.4, Section 9.3, Section
9.10(b), Section 9.11, Section 9.14 and this Section 9.6 will be enforceable
by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and assigns).

 



 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and
for the avoidance of doubt, subject in all respects to this Section 9.8,
Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9.14 (and, in each case, the limitations
set forth herein or therein), any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a
Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction
Document or otherwise, for the avoidance of doubt, although the Company may,
subject in all respects to this Section 9.8, Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Section 9.14 (and, in each case, the limitations set forth herein or therein),
pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance, subject in all respects to
this Section 9.8, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to clause (ii)
of Section 8.2(b) or the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when required
pursuant to Section 8.3(c), under no circumstances will the Company, directly
or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (1) both a grant of
specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letter) and the occurrence of the Closing, on the one hand, and (x) payment of
any monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever or (y) payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee
and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section 8.3(f)(i) or the
Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand; or (2) both payment of any
monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent
Termination Fee and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section
8.3(f)(i) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand.

 



 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) _Irreparable Damage_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of
it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that, subject in all respects to Section 9.8(b)(ii), (A) the Parties
will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; and (B) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) _Specific Performance in Respect of Financing_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or
otherwise to the contrary, and subject in all respects to this Section
9.8(b)(ii), it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent has an obligation
hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, including by exercising
its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and such obligation of Parent,
and the right of the Company to specific performance in connection with
enforcing such obligation of Parent (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) and the obligation of Parent to consummate the
Merger, will be subject to the requirements that (A) all of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing); (B)
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3; and (D)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing within two Business Days after delivery of the Companys
irrevocable written confirmation. In no event will the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing
has not been funded in full (or will not be funded in full at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In addition, it is
acknowledged and agreed that the Company will be entitled to specific
performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their obligations
under Section 6.5(b) to enforce their respective rights under the Debt
Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letters to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letters if (1) all of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing); (2) Parent and
Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to
Section 2.3; and (3) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing provided by the Debt Commitment Letters have been satisfied (other
the receipt of the Equity Financing and the satisfaction of those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is
capable of being satisfied at the Closing).

 



 

(iii) _No Objections_. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A)
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and
(B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case in compliance with this Agreement, will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
other security.

the Merger in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any

 



      
 

 



 

Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in

such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at

extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and
(v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING LETTERS
OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR AGAINST THE
FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.11.

 



 

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an " **Electronic
Delivery** "), will be treated in all manner and respects as an

 



      
 

 



 

original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

9.13 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants
and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative;
(b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing
set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent
expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or
effect of any other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.14 _Non-recourse_. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related
Parties, that all Legal Proceedings (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or
in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement,
any of the other Transaction Documents or the Merger (including the Financing)
or any other transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder; (b) the
negotiation, execution or performance this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents); (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents; and (d) any failure of the Merger
(including the Financing) or any other transactions contemplated hereunder or
thereunder to be consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are
those solely of) the Persons that are, in the case of this Agreement,
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement, and in the case of the
other Transaction Documents, Persons expressly identified as parties to such
Transaction Documents and in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Agreement or such Transaction Documents, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents to the contrary, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Related Parties, that no recourse under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents or in connection with the Merger (including the
Financing) or any other transactions contemplated hereunder or under any other
Transaction Document will be sought or had against any other Person, including
any Related Party, and no other Person, including any Related Party, will have
any liabilities or obligations (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise), for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities
arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the
items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d), it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or losses whatsoever will
attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the
aforementioned, as such, arising under, out of, in connection with or related
in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through
(d), in each case, except for claims

 



      
 

 



 

that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, may assert (subject,
with respect to the following clauses (ii) and (iii), in all respects to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b), Section 8.3(f), Section 8.3(g),
Section 8.3(h), Section 9.8(b) and this Section 9.14): (i) against any Person
that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the
Confidentiality Agreement; (ii) against each Guarantor under, if, as and when
required pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guarantee; (iii) against
the equity providers for specific performance of their obligation to fund

in accordance with, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents, no Parent Related Party will be
responsible or liable for any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages that may be alleged as a result of
