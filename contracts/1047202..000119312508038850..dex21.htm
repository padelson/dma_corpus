 ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

 SECTION 2.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined
below) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 SECTION 2.2 _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 201 Redwood Shores
Parkway, Redwood Shores, California 94065 at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a
date to be specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than the
later of (a) the second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions at such time) and (b) the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period (as defined below) to be specified by Parent on no
less than three (3) Business Days notice to the Company (it being understood
that such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion
of Parents financing) and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period, or
such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date._ "

 SECTION 2.3 _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later
time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred
to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 SECTION 2.4 _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 SECTION 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation._ The restated certificate of incorporation of the Company (the "
_Restated Certificate of Incorporation_ ") shall be amended as a result of
the Merger so as to read in its entirety in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto,
and as so amended shall be the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and
such Restated Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the bylaws
of the Company as in effect  



 

8  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in their
entirety in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto, and as so amended shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by the DGCL, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and such
bylaws.

 SECTION 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent (including any shares of Company
Common Stock contributed pursuant to the Rollover Commitment Letter), shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding.

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.7(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to $34.00, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and (ii) shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 2.8(b), without interest.

 SECTION 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates._

(a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the
Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(c). Parent shall deposit the Aggregate
Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
The Aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall,
pending its  



 

9  disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings
Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the
foregoing. Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying
Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.8(a).

(b) _Payment Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates (or evidence of Book-Entry Shares) whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.7(c) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Book-Entry Shares) as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation or surrender of Book-Entry Shares,
in each case, to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each Book-Entry Share or share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered, if
applicable, shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (i) in the case of a Certificate, the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (ii) in the case of both a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share,
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes (as defined below) required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, as contemplated by this Article II.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The
Merger Consideration paid in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Book-Entry Shares or shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and, at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. Subject to Section 2.8(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this Article II.



 

10 (e) _Termination of Fund._ At any time following the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
payment of any Merger Consideration, without any interest, that may be payable
upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such holders,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be
avoided by such holder providing information or documentation to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such information shall be
requested prior to any such withholding.

 SECTION 2.9 _Appraisal Rights._

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in
favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the appraised
value of such shares of Company Common Stock as may be determined to be due to
such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and such Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
rights to appraisal under the DGCL.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to
seek payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting
Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.7, without any
interest thereon. Parent shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent any
additional funds necessary to pay in full the Merger Consideration so due and
payable to such Dissenting Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to seek payment of the
appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares.

(c) The Company shall provide Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal.



 

11  SECTION 2.10 _Company Stock Options and RSUs._ Prior to the Effective Time,
subject to _Schedule 2.10(a),_ the Company shall take all action necessary
(including any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the board of
directors of the Company or any committee thereof) such that:

(a) Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, each option
granted under the Company Stock Plans (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock (each, an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal
to the Option Consideration (as defined below) for each share of Company
Common Stock then subject to the Option. The Option Consideration shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " shall mean, with respect to any share of
Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company
Common Stock over (B) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Option, without interest and less
applicable withholding.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by
Parent and the holder thereof, each restricted stock unit granted under the
Company Stock Plans in respect of a share of Company Common Stock
(collectively, the " _RSUs_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which is subject to vesting criteria shall vest in full and
be converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the RSU
Consideration (as defined below) for each share of Company Common Stock then
subject to the RSU, such that the holder of such RSU shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date, an aggregate amount of cash as the
holder would have been entitled to receive had such RSU been vested in full
and settled immediately before the Effective Time, without interest and less
applicable withholding (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.10 to any holder of
Options or RSUs such amount as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any provision of state or local Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall
make any required filings with and payments to the appropriate Governmental
Authority relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Options or RSUs in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 SECTION 2.11 _Adjustments._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

 ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed (a) in the corresponding schedule of the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") or (b) in or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents (as defined below),
other than disclosure referred to in the "Risk Factors" and "Note Regarding
Forward Looking Statements" sections thereof or any other disclosures included
in such filings which are forward-looking in nature, filed prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (it being
understood that any matter disclosed in the Company  



 

12  Disclosure Schedule or in or incorporated by reference in such Company SEC
Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any schedule of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to which the matter relates to the extent the
relevance to each such schedule is reasonably apparent), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing
does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Subsidiary of the Company
is in violation of any of its organizational documents in any material
respect. A list of the names of the Companys Subsidiaries, including their
jurisdiction of organization and the name of any equityholder other than the
Company or any Subsidiary is set forth on _Schedule 3.1(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The Company does not have any investment with a fair

course of business.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement, and is not in violation of any of the provisions
contained in such documents in any material respect (the " _Company
Charter Documents_ ").

 SECTION 3.2 _Capitalization._

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par

were issued and outstanding, (ii) 3,486,274 shares of Company Common Stock
were held by the Company in its treasury, (iii) 2,785,781 shares of Company

Subordinated Debentures, Series B due 2023, (v) 1,179,099 RSUs were credited
to participants under their accounts under the Company Stock Plans and (vi)
no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. There are no
restricted stock awards of the Company Common Stock outstanding.

(b) _Schedule 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
February 21, 2008, a list of all holders of outstanding Options under the
Company Stock Plans and all participants holding outstanding RSUs credited to
their accounts under the Company Stock Plans, and, in each case, the date of
grant, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option or
RSU and, in the case of the Options, the price per share at which such Option

the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of the Company convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of capital  



 

13  stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, the Company, (iii) no
outstanding options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements

exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, the Company, (iv) no obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right,
convertible or exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment
relating to any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest
(including any voting debt) in, the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii),

authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the

and the filings referred to in Section 4.3 are made, (A) violate any Law or
Order applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) with or without

the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent, Merger

of clause (ii), for such violations or defaults as would not reasonably be
expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay

 SECTION 4.3 _Governmental Approvals._ Except for (a) filings required under,
and compliance with other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the NYSE, (b) the filing of the Certificate of

performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than

obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 SECTION 4.4 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub._ Merger Sub is a
Subsidiary of Parent and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the

and has conducted its operations only as contemplated hereby.



 

24  SECTION 4.5 _Financing._

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies
of (i) an executed commitment letter (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "),
dated as of the date hereof, from Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners VI, L.P.
and certain of its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Equity Provider_ ") to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, equity financing in the
aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) an
executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together
with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), dated as of
the date hereof, from Barclays Bank PLC, General Electric Capital Corporation,
GE Capital Markets, Inc., The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and RBS Securities
Corporation d/b/a RBS Greenwich Capital to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein
(the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the "
_Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, none of the Financing Letters has been
amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and
the respective commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Letters that
are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, the
Financing Letters are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, and to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto. Assuming the Financing and the
transactions contemplated by the Rollover Commitment Letter are consummated
and the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in the second
and third sentences of Section 3.2(a), in Section 3.2(b) (but only to the
extent describing the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
Options and RSUs and the price per share at which Options may be exercised),
in the first and last sentences of Section 3.2(c) and in Section 3.2(e), the
net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters will, in the aggregate and
together with the available cash of the Company, be sufficient for Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
aggregate Option Consideration (the  _"Aggregate Option Consideration"_ ) and
aggregate RSU Consideration (the _"Aggregate RSU Consideration"_ ) (and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Financing Letters) and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all
related fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the
Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters
or other agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to the
Debt Financing (other than fee letters with the providers of the Debt
Financing) to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is a
party. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or
that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date
of the Closing. The Financing Letters contain all of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make Financing available to
Parent on the terms therein.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Equity Provider has (i) retained
any financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than advisors to which the
board of directors of the Company has previously consented or (ii) entered
into an exclusive, lock-up or similar agreement, arrangement or understanding
with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing that could reasonably be expected to prevent or hinder such provider
from providing or seeking to provide such financing to any third party in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including in connection with the making of any Takeover Proposal (as defined
below)), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
the Equity Provider has caused or induced any Person to take any action that,
if taken by Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Provider, would be a breach of,
or would cause to be untrue, any of the representations in this Section
4.5(b).

 SECTION 4.6 _Guarantee._ Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed limited guarantee of the
Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners VI, L.P. (the  _"Guarantor"_ ) with
respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein (the _"Limited
Guarantee"_ ). The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and is the
valid, binding and enforceable (subject to the Bankruptcy  



 

25  and Equity Exception) obligation of the Guarantor, and no event has
occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Limited
Guarantee.

 SECTION 4.7 _Solvency._ Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing, any alternative
financing and the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Aggregate
Option Consideration and the Aggregate RSU Consideration, any other repayment
or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Financing Letters and
payment of all related fees and expenses, assuming (a) satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger as set
forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof
(for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects), and (c) estimates, projections and
forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof were
prepared in good faith based on reasonable assumptions when prepared, the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent (as defined below). For purposes of
this Section 4.7, the term _"Solvent"_ with respect to the Surviving
Corporation means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
fair saleable value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the value of all
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with the applicable
federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, (b) the
Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged by Parent following such date and (c) the Surviving
Corporation will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" means that the Surviving
Corporation will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 SECTION 4.8 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied by
Parent in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy
Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) will, on the date
it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, and the Schedule 13E-3 (including any amendments
or supplements thereto) will, on the date it is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

 SECTION 4.9 _Certain Actions._ Except for the Ancillary Agreements and as
set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no
Contracts between Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor, on the one hand, and
any member of the Companys management, directors or stockholders, on the
other hand, as of the date hereof, that relate in any way to the Company or
the transactions contemplated hereby. Prior to the board of directors of
the Company approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other Person, was at
any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" thereunder or has taken any
action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL to be
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 SECTION 4.10 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which will occur
immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement) is the
only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby.



 

26  SECTION 4.11 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for which the Company will have any
liability prior to the Closing.

 SECTION 4.12 _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to discuss the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the management of the
Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the electronic dataroom maintained by
the Company through Merrill DataSite for purposes of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from officers of the Company, and (d) has conducted its
own independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, their
respective businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has not
relied on any representation, warranty or other statement by any Person on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in Article
III of this Agreement and that all other representations and warranties are
specifically disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing, as part of its
investigation of the Company, Parent has been given financial information,
cost estimates, forecasts, projections and information, both in writing and
orally, with respect to the Company by the Company or its agents and
representatives. Parent acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
any such projections, predictions and forecasts, and Parent is familiar with
such uncertainties. Parent has made its own evaluation of all such information
and acknowledges that none of the Company and its officers, directors,
employees, Affiliates, representatives and agents is making any
representations or warranties with respect to such information, except for the
specific representations and warranties set forth in Article III.

 SECTION 5.4 _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation._

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their Representatives to, cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, provided, however, that the
Company may (i) continue discussions or negotiations from the date hereof
until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 4, 2008 (the " _Initial Period_ ")
with the Person (the " _Excluded Party_ ") identified to Parent in writing on
the date hereof and (ii) during the Initial Period, furnish pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) any information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Excluded Party, provided
that any such information must be provided to Parent as promptly as is
reasonably practicable after its provision to the Excluded Party to the extent
not previously made available to Parent. Except with respect to the Excluded
Party during the Initial Period or as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Section 5.4, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (A) initiate, knowingly solicit or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing non-public information), any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a Takeover Proposal or (B) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not grant any waiver, amendment or release under
any standstill agreement after the date hereof without the prior written
consent of Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a),
subject to the Companys compliance in all material respects with this
Section 5.4 and only prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals,
following receipt by the Company of a written Takeover Proposal from a Person,
the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person solely in order
to (i) clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any Takeover
Proposal made by such Person so as to determine whether such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and (ii) notify such Person of the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), subject
to the Companys compliance in all material respects with this Section 5.4, if
the board of directors of the Company receives a written Takeover Proposal
after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder  



 

30  Approvals that the board of directors of the Company determines constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals the Company may (i) furnish
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement any information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover
Proposal, provided that any such information must be provided to Parent as
promptly as is reasonably practicable after its provision to such Person to
the extent not previously made available to Parent, and (ii) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding a Takeover Proposal
if, but only if, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt by, or notification to, the Company or its financial
advisor), notify Parent of the receipt (or notification) of any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiries relating to a Takeover Proposal or any request for
information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with, either the Company or its Representatives concerning a Takeover
Proposal. The Companys notice shall include (i) a copy of any written
Takeover Proposal and any other documents provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to such Takeover Proposal or (ii) in respect of
any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry relating to a Takeover Proposal or
any request for information relating to a Takeover Proposal not made in
writing, a written summary of the material terms of such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request, including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status or developments
regarding any Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information to
Parent. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any confidentiality agreement entered into after the date
of this Agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined below).

(d) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.4(e) and subject to Section
5.4(f), the board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) shall
not (i) (A) change, qualify, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted under Section 5.4(c)) (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
provisions of Section 5.4(f), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approvals, the board of directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (i) if the board of directors of the Company receives a
Takeover Proposal that has not been withdrawn that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal
and if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated by the Company in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii), or (ii) other
than in response to a Takeover Proposal, if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the
Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 5.4, (ii) the
Company has provided written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to
Parent that the Company intends to  



 

31  take such action and describing the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action, including with such Notice
of Superior Proposal a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents,
(iii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause it
financial and legal advisors, to negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good
faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iv) following
the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in response
to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this Section 5.4(f) (provided that references to the three
(3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a forty-
eight (48) hour period).

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the board of directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if
the board of directors of the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would
constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
board of directors of the Company shall not recommend that the stockholders of
the Company tender their shares in connection with any tender or exchange
offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal) or effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless in each case the applicable
requirements of Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f) shall have been satisfied.
In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement
(including Article VII), a factually accurate public statement by the Company
that describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and listen"
communication by the board of directors of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar communication to the stockholders
of the Company, shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Takeover Proposal.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal
or offer from any Person or group (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, any (i) acquisition of
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of
Subsidiaries) equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys
consolidated assets or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (ii)
acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding Company Common
Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result
in any Person or group beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any written
Takeover Proposal on terms which the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal
(including the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof), and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to
by Parent to the Company in writing in response to such proposal or
otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)."



 

32  SECTION 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions
to Closing set forth in Article VI to be satisfied as promptly as practicable
and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws (as defined below)), and (ii) obtain
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however,_ that in obtaining consent or approval from any Person
(other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay any amount to any Person or incur
any liability or other obligation or materially modify any Contract and (ii)
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount or incur any liability or obligation. For purposes hereof, _"Antitrust
Laws"_ means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all applicable Foreign
Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days from
the date hereof, or such other time as mutually agreed to by the parties, and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this Section 5.5 necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including
any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable, (ii) Parent agrees to file
with the European Commission as promptly as reasonably practicable the Form
CO, if any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the
EC Merger Regulation and the Company agrees to provide Parent as promptly as
practicable with such assistance as Parent reasonably requests for the
purposes of filing such Form CO and, if such a filing is made, each party
agrees to supply as promptly as practical any additional information and
documentary material that may be required or requested by the European
Commission and use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all other actions consistent with this Section 5.5 necessary to obtain
a decision from the European Commission declaring the transactions
contemplated hereby compatible with the Common Market, (iii) the Company
agrees to make an appropriate filing with the German Federal Cartel Office
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days from the date
hereof) or such other time as mutually agreed to by the parties, and to
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by the German Federal Cartel Office and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this Section 5.5 necessary to obtain approval under the German
Act Against Restraints of Competition (GWB) as soon as practicable and (iv)
the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take
all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law
is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(B) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize
the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the  



 

33  transactions contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the European Commission or
any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and advice of counsel, each of
the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.5, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority with respect to the application of Antitrust Laws
to the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting any other provision
hereof, Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, decision, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, on or before the Walk-
Away Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby so
as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Walk-
Away Date). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Parent shall take all
such actions, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or any of
its Subsidiaries) and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that limit Parent or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case, as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other decision or order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company shall take such of the foregoing actions as Parent may request;
_provided, however,_ that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger.

(e) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to comply with any information and consultation
obligations that may arise in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by virtue of the existence of any works council or other
employee representative body in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries operates. 

 SECTION 5.6 _Financing._

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Letters (or on terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub (including with
respect to the conditionality thereof)) and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under the Financing Letters, if such amendment, modification or waiver reduces
the aggregate amount of the Financing or amends the conditions precedent to
the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing Date or make the funding of the Financing less likely to
occur; _provided, however,_ that Parent and Merger Sub may replace and amend
the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Financing Letters and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt  



 

34  Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub
than the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter), (ii) to
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to it in such definitive
agreements that are within its control, (iii) upon satisfaction of such
conditions, to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, (iv) to
comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters and (v) to enforce all
of its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements
related thereto. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing and provide to the Company, upon its request, copies of the
definitive documents related to the Financing. In the event that all
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding
will be satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund on the
Closing Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including by taking enforcement action
to cause the Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund such Debt
Financing). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean
the first period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days throughout which (A)
Parent shall have the Required Information that the Company is required to
provide to Parent pursuant to Section 5.6(c) and (B) the conditions set forth
in Section 6.1 shall be satisfied and nothing has occurred and no condition
exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 to fail
to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during
such thirty (30) consecutive-calendar-day period; _provided, however,_ that
(1) if the Marketing Period has not been completed on or prior to August 15,
2008, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 2, 2008,
(2) the "Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to
the completion of the Marketing Period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any year end financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Documents and (3) the "Marketing Period" shall
end on any earlier date on which the Debt Financing is consummated.

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent and Merger
Sub shall immediately notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby with terms and conditions no less favorable
from the standpoint of Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period). Parent shall give the Company prompt notice if any
condition to the Financing Letters is not likely to be satisfied, in each
case, of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the
Financing Letters. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition
to Closing. For purposes of this Section 5.6, references to "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.6 and references to "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 5.6.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent and that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however,_ that no such requested cooperation may unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Such cooperation shall include (i) furnishing Parent, Merger Sub and their
Financing sources as promptly as practicable with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Parent, including all financial statements
and financial and other data of the type required by Regulation S-X (other
than Item 3-10 of Regulation S-X) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
for registered offerings of debt securities, and of the type and
form customarily included in offering documents used in private placements
under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, to consummate the Financings at the
time the Financings are to be consummated (information required to be
delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as the " _Required
Information_ "), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies in
connection with the Financing, (iii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering  



 

35  documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort
letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested
by Parent, (v) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, required to permit the consummation of the Financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time, (vi) providing unaudited consolidated
monthly financial statements of the Company (excluding footnotes) consisting
of a balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows to the extent
the Company customarily prepares such financial statements and (vii) executing
and delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates or documents as may be requested by Parent
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral; _provided, however,_ that
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Effective Time, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; _provided, however,_ that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly,
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this
Section 5.6 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing (other than to the
extent such losses arise from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives) and any information used in
connection therewith, except with respect to any information provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Provider (i) retain any
financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than advisors to which the
board of directors of the Company consents (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or (ii) enter into any
exclusive, lock-up or similar agreement, arrangement or understanding, with
any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing that could reasonably be expected to prevent such provider from
providing or seeking to provide such financing to any third party in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) The Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate executed by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company setting forth Consolidated EBITDA (as defined
below) for (i) the three (3) month period ending March 31, 2008, together with
supporting calculations in reasonable detail, by the earlier of May 15, 2008
and five (5) days following the date the Company files its Form 10-Q for the
quarter ending March 31, 2008 with the SEC and (ii) if the Closing Date shall
not have occurred on or prior to August 15, 2008, the three (3) month period
ending June 30, 2008, together with supporting calculations in reasonable
detail, on August 18, 2008.

 SECTION 5.7 _Public Announcements._ The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto,
and in accordance with Section 5.4 and Article VII, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect
to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law,
applicable fiduciary duties or by  



 

36  the rules and regulations of the NYSE as determined in the good faith
judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party
shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other
public announcement without prior consultation with the other party).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party).

 SECTION 5.8 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Companys employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties
as Parent may reasonably request (other than any publicly available document
filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws);
_provided, however,_ that Parent and its representatives shall conduct any
such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company; _provided, further, however,_ that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or any Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege or
expose the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will
be subject to the terms of that certain letter agreement, dated as of October
19, 2007, by and between the Company and Hellman and Friedman Advisors LLC (as
it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and
shall cause its representatives not to, use such information for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 SECTION 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to the Knowledge of such party, threatened against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or the remedies with respect thereto)
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 SECTION 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance._

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of
the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case, at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in
whole or in part to the  



 

37  transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and
such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (B)
the indemnification agreements listed on _Schedule 5.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive the transactions contemplated hereby
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective
Time until six (6) years from the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees
and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.10
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this Section 5.10) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law.

(b) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to
any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.10 (each, a " _Claim_ ")
with counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent; _provided, however,_ that Parent (i) shall be permitted
to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense and (ii) shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without Parents written consent,
which consent shall not be withheld if such settlement does not provide
for monetary damages, the terms of such settlement do not include any
equitable remedies or restrictions on the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries and are otherwise not in any way detrimental to the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Each
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested
in connection therewith. Nothing in this Section 5.10(b) shall relieve Parent
of its indemnity and other obligations set forth in Section 5.10(a).

(c) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
(and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms
and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to
such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided, however,_ that, if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed three hundred
percent (300%) of the current aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with
the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium of three
hundred percent (300%) of the current aggregate annual premium; _provided,
further, however,_ that any such replacement or substitution of insurance
policies shall not result in gaps in coverage.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 5.10 applies unless (i) such termination or modification
is required by applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnitee shall have  



 

38  consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.10 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.10).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.10.

 SECTION 5.11 _Fees and Expenses._ Whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
or required to incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent shall pay the filings fees required under the HSR Act or other
antitrust filings with any Governmental Authority by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 SECTION 5.12 _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 SECTION 5.13 _Employee Matters._

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each active employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the Effective Date (" _Company Employees_ ") (i)
annual base salary and base wages, and cash target incentive
compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less favorable than
such annual base salary and base wages, and cash target incentive compensation
opportunities provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding equity incentives) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided to Company Employees under the Company Plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide Company Employees whose employment is terminated during the one (1)
year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits at levels no
less than those benefits under any Company Plan, and (ii) such severance
benefits shall be determined taking into account the service crediting
provisions set forth in Section 5.13(b) below.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of severance
and paid-time-off benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the _"Old Plans"_ ), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent  



 

39  such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans
of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time, provided that, the foregoing shall not be construed to limit
the operation of Section 5.13(a), and subject to the requirements of Section
5.13(a), nothing herein shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any particular Company Plan to the
extent permitted by its terms or applicable Law.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all of
the obligations of the Company under the Company Plans that are severance
agreements, by written instrument delivered to the executive (or his or her
beneficiary or estate, as applicable) in accordance with the terms of such
agreements.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.13 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee or any
other individual associate therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third party beneficiary of the Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed
as an amendment to any Company Plan for any purpose.

 SECTION 5.14 _Delisting._ Parent shall cause the Companys securities to be
de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act at or as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

 SECTION 5.15 _Resignation of Directors._ The Company shall cause each of the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent
requested by Parent no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, to submit a letter of resignation or otherwise be removed effective on
or before the Closing Date.

 SECTION 5.16 _Parent Expenditures_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, Parent shall not expend funds other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the payment of related expenses.

 SECTION 5.17 _Termination of Senior Indebtedness._ Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of payoff letters, in
commercially reasonable form, from the administrative agent under the Senior
Credit Agreement and shall make arrangements for the release of all Liens over
the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and assets securing such
obligations, in each case subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent
and Merger Sub, if necessary.

 SECTION 5.18 _Termination of Agreements_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, at the request of Parent, execute an agreement
provided by Parent terminating all Contracts with Getty Investments and its
Affiliates (other than the Trademark Agreement).

 ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

 SECTION 7.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals:

its board of directors, in the case of the Company, and its general partner,
in the case of Parent; or

(the _"Walk-Away Date"_ );  _provided, however_ , that (i) if the Marketing
Period has not been completed on or prior to August 15, 2008, the Walk-Away
Date shall be extended to October 2, 2008 (which day shall then be the "Walk-
Away Date") and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the failure of the
Merger to have been consummated on or before the Walk-Away Date was primarily
due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided, however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;



 

42 (iii) if the Company Stockholder Approvals shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) upon a vote taken on this Agreement; or

(c) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the

cannot be cured by the Company by the Walk-Away Date or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days following

termination; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if it is then

other agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) not being satisfied;

(ii) if (A) the board of directors of the Company shall have effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) a tender offer or exchange offer

Proposal is commenced prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals and
the board of directors of the Company fails to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders
(including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the

shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days after commencement, (C)
the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement, (D) the Company fails
to include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation or (E) the

contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b) and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the Walk-Away Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)

7.1(d)(i) and the basis for such termination; _provided, however_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(d)(i) if it is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section 6.2(b) not being satisfied;

(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the
implementation of a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, if (A) the Company has complied

such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee (as defined below); or

(iii) if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing but which
conditions would be satisfied if such date were the Closing Date) on the
final day of the Marketing Period and Parent or Merger Sub has failed to
consummate the Merger no later than two (2) Business Days after the later of
(A) the final day of the Marketing Period and (B) the date on which the
Company notifies Parent that all conditions to Closing set forth in Section

nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing but
which conditions would be satisfied if such date were the Closing Date);
_provided,_  



 

43   _however_ , that if the final day of the Marketing Period is the same day
as the Walk-Away Date, the Company shall be permitted to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d)(iii) on the final day of the
Marketing Period if Parent or Merger Sub has failed to consummate the Merger
on such day, the conditions referred to above in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
have been satisfied on such day and the Company has delivered the
notification to Parent contemplated by clause (B) on or before such day.

 SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Article VIII, the last
sentence of Section 5.6(d), Section 5.11, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Limited Guarantee, in each case, in accordance with its terms, all of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of any Parent Party or Company Party, except (a) the
Company or Parent may have liability as provided in Section 7.3 and Section
7.4, and (b) subject to the provisions of Section 7.3(e), Section 7.3(f),
Section 7.3(g) and Section 8.7, nothing shall relieve any party from
liability for willful breach of this Agreement or fraud.

 SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or communicated
to the Company after the date hereof, (B) following the occurrence of an
event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by
the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) or
by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) prior to or within twelve
(12) months following the date this Agreement is terminated, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
any Takeover Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not
the Takeover Proposal was the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause
(A)); _provided, however_ , that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section
7.3(a)(i), the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)";

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii);

then the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Termination Fee, by wire
transfer of same day funds, it being understood that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For
purposes of this Agreement, _"Termination Fee"_ shall mean an amount equal to
$52,000,000 provided that if this Agreement is terminated during the Initial
Period by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), regardless of the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, the Termination Fee
shall mean an amount equal to $31,000,000. If the Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i), it shall be paid no later than three
(3) Business Days after the consummation of the Takeover Proposal transaction
described in clause (C) of Section 7.3(a)(i). If the Termination Fee becomes
payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii), it shall be paid prior to or
contemporaneously with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii) (and any purported termination pursuant to this Section shall be
void and of no force or effect unless the Company shall have made such
payment). If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(iii), it shall be paid no later than three (3) Business Days after the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii).

(b) In the event that:

(i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i);
or

(ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(iii);

then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $78,000,000 in cash
(the _"Parent Termination Fee"_ ), it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
 



 

44  occasion. If the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to this
Section 7.3(b), it shall be paid no later than three (3) Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or
Section 7.1(d)(iii), as the case may be.

(c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or Section
7.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the party entitled to receive such payment.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3,
and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment set forth in this Section 7.3, such paying party shall pay the
other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate of Bank of America,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received.

(e) Except in the event of willful breach or fraud by Parent or Merger Sub,
(i) the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from
Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or the Guarantor pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Affiliates against the Parent Parties for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise ( _"Company
Damages"_ ), and (ii) upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except that Parent
shall also be obligated with respect to Section 7.3(d) and the Guarantor
under the Limited Guarantee in respect of Section 7.3(d)). Without limiting
the Companys right to receive the Parent Termination Fee, in the event of
willful breach or fraud by Parent or Merger Sub, the Company shall be
entitled to seek Company Damages against Parent or Merger Sub, provided that
the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee) of
Parent or Merger Sub shall not exceed the Liability Limitation (as defined
below).

(f) Without limiting Parents rights under Section 8.7 or the rights of Parent
or its Affiliates under and to the extent provided in the Ancillary
Agreements, and except in the event of willful breach or fraud by the Company,
(i) Parents right to receive payment from the Company of (A) the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a) and (B) the Reimbursable Expenses (as defined
below) pursuant to Section 7.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub against the Company Parties for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise ( _"Parent Damages"_ ),
and (ii) upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (except that the Company
shall also be obligated with respect to Section 7.3(d)). Without limiting
Parents rights to receive the Termination Fee, the Reimbursable Expenses or
its remedies under Section 8.7, in the event of willful breach or fraud by the
Company, Parent shall be entitled to seek Parent Damages against the Company,
whether or not the Termination Fee has been paid or is payable, provided that
the maximum aggregate liability (inclusive of the Termination Fee and the
Reimbursable Expenses) of the Company shall not exceed the Liability
Limitation.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and Merger Sub for all Company Damages and of the
Company for all Parent Damages, respectively, shall be limited to $78,000,000
(inclusive of the Parent Termination Fee in the case of liability of Parent
and Merger Sub and inclusive of the Termination Fee and the Reimbursable
Expenses in the case of liability of the Company) plus any amounts that may
be payable under Section 7.3(d) (the _"Liability Limitation"_ ), and in no
event shall (i) the Company or any of the Affiliates that are controlled by
the Company seek any other Company Damages or any other recovery, judgment or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against  



 

45  Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any other Parent Parties in excess of
the Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub seek any other
Parent Damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any other Company Parties in excess of the Liability
Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.3 shall limit the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 8.7 or the rights of Parent or
its Affiliates under and to the extent provided in the Ancillary Agreements.
Without limiting the rights of Parent or its Affiliates under and to the
extent provided in the Ancillary Agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that each of them has no right of recovery against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to Parent
Damages, any of the Company Parties (other than the Company to the extent
provided in this Agreement), through the Company or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of the Company against any Company Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability
shall attach to, in each case with respect to Company Damages, any of the
Parent Parties (other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement and
the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Limited Guarantee), through Parent
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of Parent against the Guarantor or any other Parent Party, by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding,
by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except
for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Parent Party
(including any general partner or managing member)) under and to the extent
provided in the Limited Guarantee and subject to the Liability Limitation and
the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under
the Limited Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
and its Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Party (other
than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement) in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 SECTION 7.4 _Reimbursement of Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii), the Company
shall promptly pay Parent or its designee fifty percent (50%) of the
documented and reasonable Parent Expenses (the _"Reimbursable Expenses"_ );
_provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Reimbursable Expenses exceed
$5,000,000. _"Parent Expenses"_ shall mean all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Parent, or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates, in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financing sources, hedging counterparties, experts and consultants).

 ARTICLE VIII

MISCELLANEOUS

 SECTION 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.
This Section 8.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties
that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

 SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
boards of directors, in the case of the Company and Merger Sub, and its
general partner, in the case of Parent; _provided, however_ , that
following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, there shall be no
amendment or change to the  



 

46  provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such approval.

 SECTION 8.3 _Extension of Time; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

 SECTION 8.4 _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided, however,_ that Parent or
Merger Sub may assign its rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the other parties
hereto, but no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this Section 8.4 shall be null and void.

 SECTION 8.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process._

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract
or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

(b) Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or,
in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the federal courts of
the United States of America located in the State of Delaware. Each party
hereto hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State of Delaware in respect of any legal
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
(ii) waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action, suit
or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of such courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

(c) Each party hereto agrees that notice or the service of process in any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by
Section 8.8.

(d) The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.5 shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section
8.5 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the
parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.



 

47  SECTION 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 SECTION 8.7 _Specific Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached by the Company and that money damages may not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by the Company and to seek to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement against the Company in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware without bond or other security being required, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity (in each case, subject to the Liability Limitation in respect of Parent
Damages). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties further
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement against Parent
or Merger Sub or otherwise to obtain any equitable relief or remedy against
Parent or Merger Sub and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set
forth in Section 7.3(b) and Section 7.3(e).

 SECTION 8.8 _Notices._ All notices and other communications under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered

hereunder.

 SECTION 8.12 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company._ Whenever this

on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

 SECTION 8.13 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
