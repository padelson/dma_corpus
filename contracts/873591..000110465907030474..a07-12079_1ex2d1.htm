directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected
or designated by Parent in accordance with this _Section 2.04(a)_ ) by (ii)

of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. For purposes of

Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ hereof, until the Merger
Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least such number of
directors as may be required by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules or the federal
securities laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning
of such rules and laws (" _Independent Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_
, that in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced
below the number of directors as may be required by such rules or securities
laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall
be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed
to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by the rules of Nasdaq and the federal
securities laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or
Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

  

### (c) The Companys obligation to cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.04_ , so long as

        

### Parent shall have timely provided to the Company all information
with respect to Parent and its designees, officers, directors and
Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. Parent shall promptly supply to the Company in writing,
and shall be solely responsible for, all such information.

  

## Section 2.05 _Actions by Directors_. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_ , and until the Merger Effective Time, the approval of a
majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize: (a) any
amendment to or termination of this Agreement by the Company; (b) any
extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Parent or Purchaser; (c) any waiver of compliance with any covenant of
Parent or Purchaser or any condition to any obligation of the Company or any
waiver of any right of the Company under this Agreement; and (d) any other
consent or action by the Company or the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
thereby or in connection therewith.. The authorization of any such matter by
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall constitute the authorization of
such matter by the Company Board, and no other action on the part of the
Company or any other director of the Company shall be required to authorize
such matter.

## Section 4.03 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Stock Transfer Books_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall appoint as
paying agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "

### (c) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days following the Merger Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Paying Agent to
mail to each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective

(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates

        

### representing the Merger Shares (the " _Company Common Share Certificates_
") or uncertificated Company Common Shares (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Common
Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Company
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Company Common Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  

### (d) Upon (i) surrender to the Company Paying Agent of Company Common
Share Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of

Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Company Common Share Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
in cash, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof, and the
Company Common Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Company Paying Agent shall
accept such Company Common Share Certificates or Uncertificated Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Company Paying
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices.

  

### (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Company Common Share
Certificates so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is
registered if such Company Common Share Certificates shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated
Share shall be properly transferred and the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, as contemplated by this _Section 4.03_ , each Company Common Share
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at all times after the
Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Common Share
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IV_.

  

### (f) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Merger Shares for six months after the Merger

and any holders of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Surviving Corporation
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to

        

### or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Company Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any such
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

### (g) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund made available to the
Company Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 4.03(a)_ to pay for Company Common
Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, upon demand by Parent.

  

### (h) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Common Share Certificate relate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled.

  

### (i) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by applicable Law.

  

## Section 4.04 _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such
Company Common Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Section, " _Section 262_ ," and such
Company Common Shares, " _Company Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 4.01(b)_ , but rather, the holders of Company Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Company
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Company Dissenting Shares shall cease
and such Company Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as
of the Merger Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely
for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon)
as provided in _Section 4.01(b)_. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Company Common

        

## Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Merger Effective
Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

## Section 4.05 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options or Company
Warrants such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.
 To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares, Company Stock
Options and Company Warrants in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
Paying Agent, as applicable.

  

## Section 4.06 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that,
notwithstanding _Section 7.01(c)_ , the Company changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding prior to the Merger Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Company Common Shares, at any time during the period from the date hereof to
the Merger Effective Time, then the Merger Consideration, Employee Option
Consideration, Director Option Consideration and Company
Warrant Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted, taking into account
the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for such
transaction.

financial advisors is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take the action specified in clause (x) or
(y) below, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, the Company Board may (directly or through
advisors or representatives), subject to _Section 8.03(c)_ ,

        

### (x) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person who made such

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that
taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal, other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall be considered an adverse modification) or (B) recommend,
adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any

this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement

agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) constituting or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B)
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer or the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, and subject to the Companys compliance with the other provisions of

Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, or a material
event, development or change in circumstance that occurs, arises or becomes
known to the Company Board following the date of this Agreement, if the

financial advisors that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law.

  

### (c) The Company shall promptly (and in all cases within 24 hours) advise
Parent in writing of any Company Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal (including any changes

Proposal and of any discussions, explorations or negotiations sought to be
entered into or continued or

        

### requests for information or access to properties or assets made or
requested by such Person with the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives.  The

status (including any change to the terms and conditions thereof) of any such
Company Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence

Subsidiary that describe the material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company Board shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (x) and (y) of ****_Section 8.03(a)_ unless the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent
that it intends to take such action, and the Company shall continue to advise

and negotiations with the Person who made the Company Acquisition Proposal
in accordance with this _Section 8.03(c)_.

  

### (d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its
and their respective representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing soliciting activities, discussions or
negotiations and non-public information access, if any, with or to any Person

Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Person, if any, in
possession of the confidential information about the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with its consideration of any
potential Company Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person.

  

### (e) Nothing in this _Section 8.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company Board from disclosing any information required to be
disclosed under applicable Law or from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, nothing in this _Section 8.03_  or this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

  

## Section 8.04 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

### (a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall honor and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Plans, compensation
arrangements and agreements and employment, severance and termination plans
and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Merger Effective Time. For a period of one year following the Merger
Effective Time (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) a base salary and
annual bonus and commission opportunity no less favorable than the base
salary and annual bonus and commission opportunity provided to such employees
immediately before the Merger Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided to
such employees immediately before the Merger Effective Time.

        

### (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall,
subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to the Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee,
Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under Old Plan of the Company or its subsidiaries in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and (B)
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

### (c) With respect to annual bonus arrangements for Company Employees who
are not covered by commission plans of the Company for fiscal year 2007, the
Company shall determine for each Company Employee a pro-rata portion (the "
_Pro-Rata Payments_ ") of his or her target annual bonus (determined as if
all performance targets have been met) for fiscal year 2007 multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in calendar year
2007 prior to the Closing Date, the denominator of which is 365. Following
the Closing Date, Parent agrees to continue the annual bonus arrangements for
Company Employees for fiscal year 2007 in accordance with their terms for the
remainder of fiscal year 2007; _provided_  that each Company Employee who is
employed as of the Effective Time and either (A) continues in employment as
of December 31, 2007 or (B) ceases employment prior to December 31, 2007 due
to a termination by the Company without good cause shall be entitled upon the
completion of fiscal year 2007 to a bonus payment under the applicable bonus
plan equal to at least the employees applicable Pro-Rata Payment. All
annual bonus arrangements for Company Employees for fiscal year 2006 that
have not been paid prior to the date hereof will be paid in accordance with
their terms. The bonus plans for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 (including the
Pro-Rata Payments) shall be calculated without taking into account any
expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions

        

### contemplated by this Agreement (including any expenses or costs related
to actions undertaken in anticipation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) or any non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be
expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not been anticipated or occurred, and bonus amounts for the 2006
and 2007 fiscal years shall not be subject to negative discretion by the
administrator for the bonus plans (except to the extent that negative
discretion, if any, has historically been applied with respect to any
employee or is clearly appropriate under the design of the bonus
arrangement).

  

### (d) Parent and Purchaser shall, and following the Merger Effective Time
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take all actions necessary or
advisable to implement the employee retention arrangements contemplated in
_Section 8.04(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

### (e) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or
Company Stock Options to acquire Company Common Shares (or Company Common
Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company Stock Awards) pursuant to
this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16.

  

## Section 8.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of
the Surviving Corporation_.

  

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Merger
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period
from the date hereof through the Closing Date serving as a director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or Company Subsidiaries
or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection
with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in
settlement) resulting therefrom with respect to any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA); and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement,
advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses
incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,

        

### including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of
any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ , _however_
, that such advance shall be conditioned upon the Surviving Companys receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined by final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Section 8.05(a)_.  The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this _Section 8.05(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including
with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall

director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit
of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim,
demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of
which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 8.05(a)_ ,
upon learning of any claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry
or investigation relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 8.05(a)_ , shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation
thereof, provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Company or Parent, as applicable, under this ****_Section
8.05(a)_ , except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

  

### (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees,
agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the
charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Company Subsidiaries)
and indemnification agreements of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries identified on _Section 8.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without
further action, at the Merger Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

        

### (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall
be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

  

### (d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six
(6) years the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to Claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no
less advantageous to the insured; _provided_ , _further_ , that
such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring before the Merger Effective Time and (ii) in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 8.05(d)_ more than an amount per year of coverage equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend
more than three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or
assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to
honor all obligations thereunder.

  

### (e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 8.05_.

  

### (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 8.05_ and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
_Section 8.05_.

  

### (g) This  _Section 8.05_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation. Each of the

        

### Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
in this _Section 8.05_.

Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) with respect
to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of its or their
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,

reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute
or regulation on such transaction.

 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

in whole or in part, to any subsidiary of Parent without obtaining the
consent of the Company and any such assignment shall not relieve Parent or
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence,

### (b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the State of Delaware or of the United
States located in New Castle County, Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for
any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any Delaware Court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in _Section 11.02_  shall be deemed effective service of process on
such party.

  

## Section 11.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of the parties hereto
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 11.10_.

  

## Section 11.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

       

## Section 11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

## Section 11.13 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

  

## Section 11.14 _Company SEC Reports_. In no event shall any information
contained in any part of any Company SEC Report entitled "Risk Factors" or
"Forward-Looking Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) any representation and warranty
of the Company that is contained in this Agreement, except to the extent
such information consists of factual historical statements ( _e.g_., factual
descriptions of the performance, results of operations, assets, liabilities
or financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries).
