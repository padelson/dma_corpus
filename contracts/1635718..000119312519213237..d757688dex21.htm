satisfaction or valid waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the

Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become a direct wholly owned
Subsidiary of Intermediate Holdco.

(2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of such conditions), or at such other time and date as agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_ _._ Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger as contemplated by the DGCL (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Secretary of State_ "), in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such
later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes
effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_ _._ The effects of the Merger shall be
as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, and the
separate legal existence of Merger Sub shall cease, all as provided under the
DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Constituent Documents_ _._ At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit B_ and (ii) the by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their
entirety so as to be identical to the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be reflected as "Gannett Co., Inc."), in each
case, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers_ _._ From and after the Effective Time,
(i) the directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers
of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, except as may be determined by Parent
in its sole discretion prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, such
officer or director shall hold office until his or her respective successor is
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the governing documents of the
Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

 

SECTION 1.07. _Capital Stock_ _._

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the parties hereto or the holder of any capital stock of the
Company, Parent, Intermediate Holdco or Merger Sub (and subject to _Section_
__ _ 1.07(c)_):

 



3

    

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Excluded Shares and any Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted automatically into (A) 0.5427 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of a fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.05_ with respect to fractional shares (the " _Stock Consideration_
"), and (B) the right to receive $6.25 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash
Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.05_, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(ii) All shares of Company Common Stock (other than any Company Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a (i)
valid certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_
") or (ii) non-certificated share of Company Common Stock held by book entry
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Uncertificated Company Stock_ "),
shall, upon the Effective Time, cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such
shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder becomes entitled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, in each case without interest.

 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by Intermediate Holdco or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Intermediate
Holdco or Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company
Cancelled Shares, the " _Company Excluded Shares_ ") shall be automatically
converted into such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum
of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient of the Cash Consideration
divided by the Parent Closing Price.

(iv) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(v) Each share of capital stock of Intermediate Holdco issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that are entitled to
demand, and have properly perfected a demand, for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting_

 



4

    

  _Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the Stock Consideration and the
right to receive the Cash Consideration (plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_), unless and
until such stockholders shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
stockholders right to appraisal under the DGCL, but, instead, the holders
thereof shall be entitled only to the payment provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock. If any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right of appraisal, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this
Agreement and shall thereupon be converted into the Stock Consideration and
the right to receive the Cash Consideration (plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.07(a)_, effective at the Effective Time. The
Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of
such demands received by the Company and any other instruments served or
delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company and (B) the opportunity and right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
(x) make any payment with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or
settle any such demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal
rights in accordance with the DGCL. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
held in the Exchange Fund in respect of payment made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent on demand.

 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, should split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, or declare or pay a stock
dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock, as applicable, or declare or make any other such stock dividend or
distribution in capital stock of Parent or the Company in respect of the
Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively, or otherwise
change the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock into any
other securities, then the Exchange Ratio, the Cash Consideration and any
other number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price or the
number or fraction of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock,
as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to proportionately reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change; _provided_
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.07(c)_ shall be construed to permit
Intermediate Holdco, Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 SECTION 1.08. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each option to
acquire a share of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option, a cash payment equal to the
excess of (i) the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) an amount equal
to the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Parent Closing Price over (ii)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, which amount shall
be paid to the holder of such Company Stock Option within ten (10) Business
Days following the Effective Time.

 



5

    

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards._

 

(i) At the Effective Time, except as provided in _Section_ __ _
1.08(b)(ii)_, each outstanding restricted stock unit award with respect to a
share of Company Common Stock that is not a Company Performance Share Unit
Award or a Company Phantom Share Unit (each, a " _Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award_ ") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award subject
to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "
_Adjusted RSU_ "), with respect to a number of underlying shares of Parent
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,
and rounding the resulting number to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Award Exchange
Ratio_ " means the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) (1) the Cash
Consideration divided by (2) the Parent Closing Price.

 

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award held as of the Effective Time by a non-employee director shall be
fully accelerated, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_ with respect to (x)
each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Unit Award and (y) each dividend equivalent unit in respect of such Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award.

action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent
Restricted Stock Unit Award subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Company Performance Share Unit Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that such Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award shall
be subject only to service-based vesting conditions and no longer subject to
achievement of applicable performance goals) (each, an " _Adjusted PSU_ "),

 SECTION 2.01. _Exchange Fund_ _._ Immediately prior to or substantially

_Exchange Agent_ ") designated by Parent, which bank or trust company shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, uncertificated, book-entry shares
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver
the aggregate Stock Consideration. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration, any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and cash in lieu of any fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock to which any holder of shares of Company Common Stock

Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ". Any amounts payable in respect of Company Equity
Awards in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.08_ shall not be deposited with
the Exchange Agent but shall instead be paid through the payroll of the
Company and its Affiliates. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.08_, _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ or
_Section_ __ _  2.05_.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Procedures_ _._

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of one or more
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent
and which shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii)
customary instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_).

 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent (or an affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.09_), together with
a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to, as promptly as practicable, (i) credit to the
holder of such Certificate in the stock ledger and other appropriate books and
records of Parent the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) pay and deliver to
the holder of such Certificate by wire transfer or check the aggregate Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.05_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder becomes
entitled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ (in each case, with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate). Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _
2.02_, each Certificate shall at any time from and after the Effective Time
represent only the Stock Consideration and the right to receive the Cash
Consideration (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_

 



8

    

  _2.05_ ) into which the shares represented by such Certificates have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other
distributions to which the holder of such Certificates becomes entitled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

(c) The holders of record of Uncertificated Company Stock shall not be
required to take any action with respect to the exchange of their
Uncertificated Company Stock for the Merger Consideration. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to (i) credit to the holder of such Uncertificated Company Stock in the stock
ledger and other appropriate books and records of Parent the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such Uncertificated Company
Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) pay and
deliver to the holder of such Uncertificated Company Stock by wire transfer or
check the aggregate Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement, together with any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ (in each case, with respect to such
Uncertificated Company Stock), as well as appropriate materials (in a form to
be reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent) advising the holder of the
completion of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of both
Certificates and Uncertificated Company Stock shall be required to complete
the exchange procedures outlined in the preceding subsections of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_ for such holders Certificates before such holder will
receive the credits and payments contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) above
for such holders Uncertificated Company Stock.

(d) If credit or payment of Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration (and
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which a
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which a holder becomes entitled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_), respectively, with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock is to be made to or in respect of a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly representing such shares of
Company Common Stock or Uncertificated Company Stock is registered on the
transfer records of the Company, Parent may cause the Exchange Agent to so
credit or pay the foregoing, as the case may be, to such Person only if such
Certificate (if applicable) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that any applicable
stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

SECTION 2.03. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_ _._ No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_) in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02_.
Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.09_), such holder shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or distributions, without interest, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to the Parent Common Stock into which the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate were converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_. Such holder shall be entitled to vote
after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders with a record
date at or after the Effective Time the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the shares of 

 



9

    

 Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates were
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_, regardless of whether such holder
has surrendered their Certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_) in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.02_.

 

SECTION 2.04. _No Further Ownership Rights_ _._ The shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of _Article I_ and this _Article II_ (including
any cash paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_) shall be deemed to have been
delivered or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Company Stock shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement (together with any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders of any Certificates become entitled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_), without interest, and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

SECTION 2.05. _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_ _._ No fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.07_ that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificates and
Uncertificated Company Stock held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by the _Wall Street Journal_ or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on each of the five (5) consecutive Trading Days ending on
(and including) the Trading Day that is three (3) Trading Days prior to the
date of the Effective Time (the " _Parent Closing Price_ "), rounded down to
the nearest penny.

SECTION 2.06. _Termination of Exchange Fund_ _._ Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on
the instruction of Parent, and any holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Company Stock that have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ or cashed any check or otherwise accepted delivery of any amounts
payable to them in accordance with _Article I_ and this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof for the Merger Consideration
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_ and any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 



10

    

SECTION 2.07. _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Intermediate Holdco, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration or portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated
Company Stock as of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity)
shall, to the extent permissible by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

SECTION 2.08. _Investment of the Exchange Fund_ _._ Any funds included in the
Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly
be paid to Parent. Any loss of any of the funds included in the Exchange Fund
shall be for the account of Parent and shall not alter Parents obligation to
cause to be paid the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders of any Certificates become entitled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 

SECTION 2.09. _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate or other documentation (including
an indemnity in customary form) reasonably requested by Parent, the Exchange
Agent (or, after dissolution of the Exchange Fund, Parent) will deliver the
applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

 

SECTION 2.10. _Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of Parent, Intermediate Holdco,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld with respect to the payment of such amounts under the Code (and the
Treasury Regulations) or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and, if required, paid
over to the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.11. _Further Assurances_ _._ From and after the Effective Time, the
respective officers of Parent, Intermediate Holdco and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the

and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired
or to be acquired by Parent, Intermediate Holdco or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 

SECTION 2.12. _Stock Transfer Books_ _._ From and after the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

agreement or arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ shall not apply to Continuing Employees who
are covered by a Company Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor all
Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from amending or terminating any Company
Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by the terms of such plan. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that the occurrence of the Effective Time shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control", "change of control" or term of
similar import, as applicable, for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan
containing such terms.

(c) For all purposes under any Parent Benefit Plan providing benefits to
any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee
shall, subject to applicable Law and any obligations under the Company
Collective Bargaining Agreements, be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries

 



55

    

 before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plans except to the extent such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject to any applicable Law and any obligations under
the Company Collective Bargaining Agreements, Parent shall, or shall cause
its applicable Affiliate, to provide that no pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Continuing Employees under the
Parent Benefit Plans except to the extent such condition or exclusion was
applicable to an individual Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
or its applicable Affiliate shall provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the Parent Benefit Plans.

(d) Prior to making any broad-based written communications pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any schedules hereto), the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any such comments; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to any communications to the extent the statements
contained therein concerning compensation or benefit matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated hereby are substantially similar to previous
communications made by the Company with respect to which the Company has
complied with the provisions of this sentence.

(e) From and after the Closing, Parent shall assume and honor, in
accordance with their terms, each outstanding cash-based performance unit
award (each such unit, a " _Company Performance Unit_ "). The number of
Company Performance Units outstanding as of immediately following the Closing
shall be determined in good faith by the Executive Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, in
accordance with the terms of such Company Performance Units. In accordance
with the terms of the Company Performance Units, from and after the Closing,
each Company Performance Unit shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Performance Unit immediately
prior to the Closing, except that following the Closing, each Company
Performance Unit shall vest subject only to continued service-based vesting
requirements.

(f) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of each Company Collective
Bargaining Agreement until such Company Collective Bargaining Agreement
otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is modified by the parties
thereto.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or any other provision
of this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
including any Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) shall
alter or limit the ability of any of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iii) is intended to confer upon any employee
any right to employment or continued employment for

 



56

    

 any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any employee, director, officer or
other service provider or any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, Parent
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement)
any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.03. _Indemnification Continuation_ _._

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, " _Indemnified Person_ "
shall mean any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
Effective Time, (x) an officer or director of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or (y) serving at the request of the Company as an
officer or director of another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise
or general partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Parent Subsidiaries to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify each Indemnified Person against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities and judgments incurred or paid in connection with any
Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or arising
directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company
as an officer or director of or in any similar capacity with another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether pertaining to any matter
arising before or after the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). In the event of any
such Proceeding, each Indemnified Person will, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such Proceeding from Parent within a reasonable
period of time following receipt by Parent from such Indemnified Person of a
request therefor;  _provided_ that an Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (only to the extent required by the DGCL) to
repay Parent for any expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.03_ if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person did not meet
the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under the DGCL as in
effect at the Effective Time. For six years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to amend, repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys or any of the Company
Subsidiaries Organizational Documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Person. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (as
applicable) assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_,
unless such assumption occurs by operation of Law.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time,
the Companys

 



57

    

 current directors and officers liability insurance policies covering acts
or omissions occurring (or alleged to occur) prior to or at the Effective Time
with respect to Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that,
but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than 300% of current annual
premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of current
annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may, at its election,
purchase at or prior to the Effective Time, or Parent may, at its election,
purchase following the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officers and
directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person
(as applicable); provided that without Parents consent, the cost of such
"tail" policy shall not exceed 300% of current annual premiums. If such "tail"
policy has been established by Parent or the Company, Parent shall not
terminate such policy and shall cause all obligations of Parent or the Company
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to the
directors and officers of the Company who become directors or officers of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary directors and officers liability insurance
on the same basis and to the same extent as that, if any, provided to other
similarly situated directors or officers of Parent or such Parent Subsidiary.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall survive
the consummation of the Merger for a period of six years and are expressly
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or
made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

ARTICLE VII

_Additional Covenants of the Parties_

SECTION 7.01. _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and Registration Statement; Stockholder Meetings_ _._

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the registration statement on Form S-4 (and any
amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Share Issuance_ ")
will be registered with the SEC (the " _Registration Statement_ ") (in which
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included), and Parent shall file
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement with the
SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act
as soon after such filing as practicable, to ensure that the Registration
Statement complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the

 



58

    

 Securities Act and the Exchange Act and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the Company Recommendation, the Parent
Recommendation, the Committee Recommendation and the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company in favor of approval of any resolution
required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act to approve, on an advisory
basis, the compensation required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, except to the extent there has been
a Company Change in Recommendation permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ (in
which case the Company Recommendation may be excluded) or there has been a
Parent Change in Recommendation permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ (in which
case the Parent Recommendation or the Committee Recommendation may be
excluded). Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its
respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement becomes effective. The parties shall promptly provide one another
copies of any written comments received from the SEC with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, promptly advise one
another of any oral comments received from the SEC with respect thereto and
promptly provide one another with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand with
respect thereto. Prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and shall consider in good faith any such comments,
except to the extent such disclosures relate to a Company Acquisition Proposal
or a Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Parent, Intermediate Holdco and the Company shall make all necessary
filings with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky"
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each party will advise the
other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement shall be filed without the
approval of both the Company and Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;  _provided_ that with respect
to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, this right of
approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or such other partys business, financial condition or results of
operations. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the

 



59

    

 circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

 

(c) The Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be duly
called and held as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the
Company (i) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Required Company Vote and otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting and (ii) shall not submit any
other proposal (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Law
to be voted on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby
and, if the Company Stockholders Meeting is also the Companys annual
stockholders meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with the
Companys annual stockholders meeting) to Company stockholders in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company reasonably believes that
(i) it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or
(ii) (A) the Company will not receive proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Required Company Vote,
whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) the Company will not have a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall have the right to, and
shall upon request by Parent, on one or more occasions postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the minimum duration determined by the
Company in good faith to be necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise
to such adjournment or postponement and not more than an aggregate of 40 days
(in the case of all postponements and adjournments under clause (ii) of this
sentence collectively) or more than 10 days (in the case of any postponement
or adjournment under clause (i) of this sentence). The Company shall permit
Parent and its Representatives to attend the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Parent shall cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be duly called
and held as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Parent Vote. In connection with such meeting, Parent
(i) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.05_, shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Required Parent Vote and otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting and (ii) shall not submit any other
proposal (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be
voted on by Parents stockholders in connection with the Share Issuance and,
if the Parent Stockholders Meeting is also Parents annual stockholders
meeting, proposals customarily brought in connection with Parents annual
stockholders meeting) to Parent stockholders in connection with the Parent
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent reasonably believes that (i) it
is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the

 



60

    

 stockholders of Parent within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Parent Stockholders Meeting or (ii) (A) Parent will not receive proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Required Parent Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) Parent
will not have a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall have the right
to, and shall upon request by the Company, on one or more occasions postpone
or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the minimum duration necessary
to remedy the circumstances giving rise to such adjournment or postponement
and not more than an aggregate of 40 days (in the case of all postponements
and adjournments under clause (ii) of this sentence collectively) or more than
10 days (in the case of any postponement or adjournment under clause (i) of
this sentence). Parent shall permit the Company and its Representatives to
attend the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

 

(e) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting on the same
date.

(f) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Intermediate Holdco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, shall execute and deliver, in accordance with applicable Law and
its Organizational Documents, a written consent adopting this Agreement. Such
consent shall not be modified or rescinded and Parent shall deliver a copy of
such consent to the Company promptly upon the execution thereof.

 SECTION 7.02. _Access to Information_ _._ Upon reasonable notice, each of
Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to)
afford to the other party hereto and its Representatives (and the Financing
Parties) reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its officers, employees, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities and to all books and records, including
financial statements, other financial data and monthly financial statements
within the time such statements are customarily prepared, and, during such
period, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party hereto and its
Representatives (and the Financing Parties), all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such Person may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that either party hereto may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that, in such Persons reasonable judgment, (i) providing
such access would result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the withholding party shall use reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access to the maximum extent that does not result in a waiver
of attorney-client privilege), (ii) providing such access would violate the
terms of any confidentiality provision in any Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or (iii) any Law of any Governmental Entity
applicable to such Person requires such Person or its Subsidiaries to preclude
the other party and its Representatives (or Financing Parties, as applicable)
from gaining access to any properties or information; _provided_ , _further_
, that the withholding party will inform the requesting party of the general
nature of the document or information being withheld and reasonably cooperate
with the requesting party to provide such document or information in a manner
that would not result in violation of Contract or Law or the loss or waiver of
such privilege, including by using reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of any counterparty to a Contract to enable the Company to provide
the withheld information. No investigation by a party or its Representatives
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and
warranties of the other party 

 



61

    

 set forth in this Agreement. Each party hereto will hold any such
information that is non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of that certain agreement, dated March 29,
2019 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent.
Information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall also
be subject to that certain the common interest, confidentiality and joint
defense agreement, dated as of June 18, 2019, between the Company and Parent,
and either the Company or Parent may restrict access to information to be
exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ as provided in such
agreement.

SECTION 7.03.  _Efforts_ _._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement and in any event no later than the
Termination Date, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following as soon as practicable and in any event no later than the

exemptions, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) obtaining all such waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals and (iii) giving
all notices and obtaining all consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations that
are necessary or advisable to be given to or obtained from any third party
other than a Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement,
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, and to substantially comply as
promptly as practicable with any "second request" for additional information
and documentary material under the HSR Act and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting

and considering in good faith any such

 



62

    

 comments; (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ "), any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other person, including by promptly providing
copies to the other party of any such written communications, and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (iii) where legally permissible, permit the other party to review
any communication it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
substantive meeting, telephone call, or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC, or
such other Governmental Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to all matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(a)_) or other person
( _provided_ that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
and (B) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns), and allow the other party and/or its counsel to attend and
participate at any such meeting, telephone call or conference (whether
in person or by telephone). Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material to be provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_ as "
_Antitrust Counsel Only Material_ ". Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
and one in-house counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
counsel to other employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials

purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other national, federal or state, domestic
or foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,

effect of monopolization or restraint of trade, affecting competition or
market conditions through merger, acquisition or other transaction or
effectuating foreign investment.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_, Parent and the Company (if requested by Parent), along
with their respective Subsidiaries, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken any and all steps and to make or cause to be made
any and all undertakings necessary (x) to resolve such objections, if any,
that a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction asserts under any
Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Regulatory
Law asserted by any such Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the extent
necessary so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the Termination
Date, which reasonable best efforts shall include (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, license or other disposition of
any Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
contracts, customers or assets of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) taking or committing
to take such other actions that may limit or impact Parents or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, or the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of Parents
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or the Companys or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, contracts,
customers or

 



63

    

 assets, (iii) entering into any orders, settlements, undertakings,
contracts, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements to effectuate any
of the foregoing or in order to vacate, lift, reverse, overturn, settle or
otherwise resolve any order that prevents, prohibits, restricts or delays the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, in
any case, that may be issued by any court or other Governmental Entity, (iv)
creating, terminating or divesting relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries and (v)
forfeiting or non-continuing any Permit (including withdrawing or being
compelled to withdraw from an applicable jurisdiction or being subject to any
suspension of a Permit), in each case in connection with obtaining all, or
eliminating any requirement to obtain any, waiting period expirations or
terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, exemptions, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law or from any
Governmental Entity so as to enable to the Closing to occur no later than the
Termination Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not, unless
requested to do so by Parent, commit to or effect any action contemplated in
clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any, or eliminating any requirement to obtain any,
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
exemptions, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and
authorizations for the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act
or any other Regulatory Law or from any Governmental Entity, none of Parent
or the Parent Subsidiaries shall be required to, and none of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of Parent,
offer, accept, agree to or commit to any term, condition, liability,
obligation or undertaking that is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger or that individually or in the aggregate, would have or would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, results
of operations, assets or financial condition of Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(provided that for this purpose, Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall be deemed to be of a size and scale that is equal to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction is
instituted challenging the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) oppose fully and
vigorously, including by defending through litigation, any such action or
proceeding, (ii) pursue vigorously all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and (iii) seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order that is in effect

Recommendation or violate this _Section_ __ _ 7.04(c)_.

 

(d) Prior to the Board of Directors of the Company making a Company Change
in Recommendation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.04(c)(A)(x)_, the Company

Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after

faith with Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Company Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal and, following the end of

 such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law
and that the Company Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a
Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were given
effect.

revised terms) of such Company Acquisition Proposal (including any financing
thereof) which is sent or received in respect of such Company Acquisition
Proposal between the Company and the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal (or by any of their respective Representatives on its behalf). The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the status
and material details and substantive discussions (including any amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company

information was not previously provided to Parent. The Board of Directors of
the Company shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the
terms of this Agreement or the Merger proposed by Parent in response to any
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and the
Company Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits by its terms the
Company from providing any information to Parent under, or otherwise complying
with the terms of, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_.

period) advising the Company that the Board of Directors of Parent or the
Transaction Committee intends to take such action, and specifying
the material terms and conditions of, and including a copy of any transaction
documents relating to, the Parent Superior Proposal, and during such five (5)
Business Day period (or any subsequent three (3) Business Day period), if
requested by the Company, Parent shall negotiate in good faith with the
Company to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Parent Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal and, following the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of Parent or the Transaction Committee, as applicable, shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by the Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of Parent or the Transaction Committee, as applicable,
to Parents stockholders under applicable Law and that the Parent Acquisition
Proposal would continue to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the
revisions proposed by the Company were given effect.

 

(e) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in any event within 48
hours) after receipt or occurrence of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for information that is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, of (i) the material terms and conditions of any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the identity of the Person making any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal. In addition, Parent shall promptly (but in
any event within 48 hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to the Company
copies of any Parent Acquisition Proposal and any written documentation
or correspondence setting forth or reflecting the terms (or revised terms) of
such Parent Acquisition Proposal (including any financing thereof) which is
sent or received in respect of such Parent Acquisition Proposal between
Parent

their respective Representatives on its behalf). Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material details and
substantive discussions (including any amendments or proposed amendments) of
any such Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall provide to the Company any
non-public information concerning Parent prior to or concurrently with
providing such information to any other Person in connection with any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, to the extent such information was not previously
provided to the Company. The Board of Directors of Parent or the Transaction
Committee, as applicable, shall promptly consider in good faith (in
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any
proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger proposed by
the Company in response to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent agrees that
it and the Parent Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits by its terms
Parent from providing any information to the Company under, or otherwise
complying with the terms of, this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_.

 

SECTION 7.06. _Stockholder Litigation_ _._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with

Company shall control the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Company
Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall consult with Parent with respect
to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Company Transaction
Litigation and shall consider in good faith Parents advice with respect to
such Company Transaction Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, or offer or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, any Company Transaction Litigation without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If any Company Transaction Litigation

Transaction Litigation. Parent may not compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, or offer or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, any Parent Transaction Litigation without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

SECTION 7.07. _Public Announcements_ _._ Except with respect to any
communications relating to a Company Change in Recommendation or Parent
Change in Recommendation, in each case made in accordance with this Agreement,
each of the parties

 



74

    

 hereto agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable United States securities exchange, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent
so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party;
_provided_ that (a) the foregoing shall not apply to any public release or
announcement so long as the statements contained therein concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby are substantially similar to previous
releases or announcements made by the applicable party with respect to which
such party has complied with the provisions of this sentence and (b) no
consent or consultation shall be required with respect to any public release
or announcement issued in connection with a dispute between the parties.

resulting from the Merger by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent or
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with

SECTION 7.10. _Governance Matters_ _._ Parent and the Company shall take, or
cause to be taken, the actions set forth on _Exhibit C_.

SECTION 7.11. _Financing_ _._

 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and consummate the Financing or any Substitute Financing in an amount
sufficient, together with cash on hand that replaces or supplements
the Financing consistent with the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.11_, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including the payment of the Cash Consideration, 

 



75

    

 any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ , any
Indebtedness of the Company (including the Company Credit Agreement) required
to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied
or discharged in connection with the Merger and any premiums and fees incurred
in connection therewith, and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected
to be incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) no later than the Closing, including, using
reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter
and comply in all material respects with all of their respective obligations
thereunder, (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing (the " _Financing Agreements_ ") reflecting the terms
contained in the Commitment Letter (or, to the extent not included in the
Commitment Letter, with other terms agreed by Parent and the Financing
Parties, _provided_ that, any changes to terms contained in the Commitment
Letter shall be subject to the restrictions on amendments of the Commitment
Letter set forth below), so that such agreements are in effect through the
Closing and (C) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letter and (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the Financing and the
Financing Agreements related thereto that are in Parents (or the Parent
Subsidiaries) control. In the event that all conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ have been satisfied or waived
or, upon funding of the Financing, shall have been satisfied or waived,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Persons providing the Financing to fund on the Closing
Date the Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including the payment of the Cash Consideration, any other amounts required
to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ , any Indebtedness of the Company
(including the Company Credit Agreement) required to be repaid, redeemed,
retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in
connection with the Merger and any premiums and fees incurred in connection
therewith, and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby). Parent and/or Intermediate Holdco shall pay, or cause to
be paid, as the same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts
under the Commitment Letter. Each of Parent and Intermediate Holdco
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition
to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth
in _Sections 8.01_ and _8.02_.

 

(b) Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of
the status of Parents and the Parent Subsidiaries efforts to obtain the
Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including promptly providing
copies of any amendment, modification or replacement of the Commitment Letter
( _provided_ , that any fee letter may be redacted to remove the fee amounts,
the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic terms
that could not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability,
termination or aggregate principal amount of the Financing) and shall give
the Company prompt written notice of any fact, change, event or circumstance
that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse impact on the Financing necessary for the satisfaction
of all of Parents and the Parent Subsidiaries obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Cash Consideration, any other amounts
required to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ , any Indebtedness of the Company
(including the Company Credit Agreement) required to be repaid, redeemed,
retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in
connection with the Merger and any premiums and fees incurred in connection
therewith, and any other fees and 

 



76

    

 expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including, promptly after obtaining Knowledge thereof, providing the Company
written notice of any (A) breach or default by a Financing Party, or any party
to any definitive document related to the Financing, of the Commitment Letter
or any definitive document related to the Financing, (B) actual or threatened
withdrawal, repudiation or termination in writing of the Commitment Letter by
the Financing Parties or (C) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Financing, on the one hand, and Parent or Intermediate Holdco, on the
other hand, in each case with respect to the obligations to fund the Financing
or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing; _provided_ , that
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege to the extent such privilege is asserted in good faith or otherwise
would violate or contravene any Law or any obligation of confidentiality so
long as Parent or its Affiliates shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege or violate such Law or obligation of confidentiality. Parent and
Intermediate Holdco may not amend, modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree
to any waiver under the Commitment Letter without the prior written approval
of the Company, to the extent such amendment, replacement, modification,
assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of,
any provision of or remedy under the Commitment Letter would (i) reduce the
aggregate cash amounts of the Financing (including by increasing the
amount of fees to be paid or the original issue discount) unless the
aggregate amount of the Financing following such reduction, together with cash
on hand and other financial resources of Parent on the Closing Date, is
sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the Cash Consideration, any other amounts
required to be paid pursuant to _Article I_ , any Indebtedness of the Company
(including the Company Credit Agreement) required to be repaid, redeemed,
retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in
connection with the Merger and any premiums and fees incurred in connection
therewith, and any other fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred
in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that any such reduction in such
amounts in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter shall be
permitted), (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the
Financing or (iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of
the Commitment Letter, in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be
expected to (A) materially delay or make less likely the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing
Date, (B) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Intermediate
Holdco to enforce its rights against the Financing Parties, any other parties
to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements or (C) materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries to
timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Intermediate
Holdco may modify, supplement or amend the Commitment Letter to (1) add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
and (2) implement or exercise any "market flex" provisions contained in the
Commitment Letter. In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, such new

 



77

    

 commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be the "Commitment
Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement and references to "Financing"
herein shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, as
applicable. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment
Letter. If funds with respect to all or any portion of the Financing become
unavailable (other than in accordance with the terms of the Commitment
Letter), Parent shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries to,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (x) notify
the Company in writing thereof and (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
substitute financing, including, as applicable, a commitment to provide such
substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable to Parent and/or Intermediate Holdco, taken as a whole, than the
terms and conditions as set forth in Commitment Letter) sufficient, together
with cash on hand and other financial resources of Parent on the Closing
Date, to enable Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the payment of the
Cash Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to
_Article I_ , any Indebtedness of the Company (including the Company Credit
Agreement) required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or
otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger and
any premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith, and any other fees
and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) in
accordance with the terms hereof (the " _Substitute Financing_ ") and,
promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company correct and complete
copies of the new financing documents, including any new commitment letter and
any related fee letters (in redacted form removing the fee amounts, the rates
and amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic terms that could
not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or
aggregate principal amount of the Substitute Financing), or related
definitive financing documents with respect to such Substitute Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Substitute Financing or related definitive
financing documents may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies
to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in the
Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms
(including any "market flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected
to make the likelihood that the Substitute Financing would be funded less
likely without the Companys prior written consent. Upon obtaining any
commitment for any such Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed
to be a part of the "Financing" and any commitment for such Substitute
Financing shall be deemed to be the "Commitment Letter", in each case, for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, on a timely basis, upon the reasonable request of Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, provide customary cooperation in connection
with the Financing or any other debt, equity, equity-linked or
other financing of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
following:

 

(i) furnishing, or causing to be furnished, to Parent, any of the Parent
Subsidiaries and the Financing Parties and their respective agents (A) the

Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries filed with the SEC relating to such
financing or otherwise in connection with any such financing consisting of an
offering of securities;

 

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries independent accountants to (A) participate in a manner
consistent with their customary practice in drafting sessions and accounting
due diligence sessions in connection with such financing and (B) provide
customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort) with
respect to financial information related to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, to the extent such comfort letters are required to be delivered
to the applicable underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in

comprising part of such financing;

 

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries in (including by providing information limited to the Company

documents (including customary certificates, affidavits and title insurance
related assistance) and similar or related documents to be prepared by Parent
or the Parent Subsidiaries in connection with such financings, and which may
incorporate by reference periodic and current reports filed by the Company
with the SEC, in each case upon the reasonable request of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries and as necessary or customary to consummate the
Financing;

(v) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with customary marketing
efforts of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including using
reasonable best efforts to cause its management team, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, to assist in preparation for and to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions, and
sessions with rating agencies, in each case, upon reasonable notice and
at mutually agreeable dates and times and using reasonable efforts to ensure
that any syndication efforts benefit from any existing lending and investment
banking relationships;

 



79

    

(vi) causing the taking of corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of
the Closing Date) reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the
Financing by persons that shall remain or will become officers or directors of

information to prospective lenders or investors and containing a
representation that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not
include material non-public information about the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (only to the extent such authorization letters contain customary
disclaimers for the Company, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives with respect to responsibility for the use or
misuse of the contents thereof); and

 

(x) providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma
information, risk factor disclosure and other disclosures required to

Company Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives, in each case
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, shall be kept

consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
trademarks, service marks and logos solely in connection with the financing
for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_

(e) In connection with _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.12_,
(w) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any liability or expenses
in connection with any financing to be obtained by Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except
such expenses for which Parent or one of the Parent Subsidiaries is obligated
to reimburse the Company or, if reasonably requested by the Company, for which
funds that are actually necessary to pay such expenses are provided in
advance by Parent or one of the Parent Subsidiaries to the Company, (x)
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers shall be obligated to execute any agreement,
certificate, document or instrument with respect to such financing (except as
explicitly provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.12_) that would be effective prior to
the Closing (other than customary authorization letters), (y) any required
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and (z) neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall be
required to take or cause to be taken any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _

warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or cause any condition in _Article VIII_ to not be
satisfied; (2) would conflict with (A) the Organizational Documents of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any material Laws or material
Contracts of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or (B) obligations of
confidentiality from a third party (not created in contemplation hereof)
binding on the Company or the Company Subsidiaries ( _provided_  that in the
event that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries do not provide information
in reliance on the exclusion in this clause (B), the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall provide notice to Parent promptly that such information

obligation of confidentiality)); (3) would require providing access to or
disclosing information that would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to allow for such access to the maximum
extent that does not result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege); (4)
would require its legal counsel to provide any legal opinions; (5) would
require the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to prepare any projections; or
(6) would require the adoption of resolutions or execution of consents to
approve or authorize such financing effective prior to the Closing Date. The
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall
be indemnified and held harmless by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with such financing to the fullest extent permitted by Law
and with appropriate contribution to the extent such indemnification is not
available, other than to the extent any such liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties are the
result of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, or
such Persons material breach of this Agreement, or with respect to any
material misstatement or omission in information provided in writing hereunder
by any of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives for
use in connection herewith or with the financing. Parent shall promptly, upon
written request by the Company, reimburse the Company or any of the Company

81

    

 actually incurred by each such Person in connection with the cooperation
provided under this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, or such
financing, whether or not the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is
terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a breach of
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ shall not be deemed to
cause the condition in _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ to fail to be satisfied
unless such breach was the primary cause of Parent failing to obtain the
Financing.

 

SECTION 7.12. _Certain Indebtedness; Convertible Notes_ _._

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, deliver
all notices and take all other actions required to facilitate (i) the
termination of commitments in respect of the Company Credit Agreement and the
repayment in full of all obligations in respect of any Indebtedness incurred
under the Company Credit Agreement, and (ii) to the extent requested in
writing by Parent and reasonably necessary to consummate the Financing or any
Substitute Financing, the termination, repayment, redemption or defeasance of
any other Indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by any of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and the repayment in
full of all obligations in respect of such Indebtedness (it being understood
that the Company shall promptly and in any event no later than ten (10) days
prior to the Closing Date notify Parent of the amount of any such
Indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and expected to be outstanding on the
Closing Date), and the release of any Liens securing any such Indebtedness
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) and guarantees in connection
therewith on the Closing Date. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent (i) (A) at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, a draft payoff letter and (B) on the Closing Date, an
executed payoff letter, with respect to the Company Credit Agreement (the "
_Company Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for transactions
of this type, from the agent thereunder on behalf of the Persons to whom such
Indebtedness is owed, which Company Payoff Letter together with any related
release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount
and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries securing the Company Credit Agreement and any
other obligations secured thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set
forth in the Company Payoff Letter at or prior to the Closing, be released and
terminated.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable
best efforts to comply with all of their respective obligations under the
Convertible Notes Indenture, including delivering any notices and entering
into any agreements, instruments, supplemental indentures and undertakings as
required pursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, and shall not amend,
supplement or modify any of the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture
without the prior written consent of Parent.

all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
If any Takeover Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party to this Agreement shall take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required
by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of

than 20%" in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed
to be a reference to "more than 50%", and the term " _Parent Acquisition

Termination Fee is payable for

 



89

    

 the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

(k) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 9.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and are
not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. If Parent fails to pay promptly the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, Parent will also pay the Companys reasonable
costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to
collect payment of such overdue amount, together with interest on the unpaid
amount under this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_, accruing from its due date, at an
interest rate per annum equal to two percentage points in excess of the prime
rate quoted by _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent
be required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee more than
once. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Parent Termination Fee
is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances
in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ that
(1) after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires
further approval by such stockholders, without approval by such holders and
(2) in the case of Parent, any such amendment may be effected only upon the
recommendation of, or otherwise at the direction or with the approval of, the
Transaction Committee. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

waiver shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders, without approval by such holders, and (2) in the case of any
such extension or waiver by Parent, such extension or waiver may be effected
only upon the recommendation of, or otherwise at the direction or with the
approval of, the Transaction Committee. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure or delay of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any
other right hereunder.

SECTION 12. NO JOINT VENTURE.

 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make the Company and the

SECTION 13. EFFECTIVE TIME; TERM.

 

(a) This Agreement shall have no force or effect until such time as the
Merger becomes effective in accordance with the Merger Agreement (such time,
the "Effective Time"). Until the Effective Time, the Original AandR Management
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
At the Effective Time, this Agreement shall automatically amend and restate
the Original AandR Management Agreement in its entirety without any further
action required by the Company or the Manager. If the Effective Time does not
occur for any reason, then this Agreement shall be null and void and shall
have no force or effect and shall be disregarded by the parties hereto, and
the Original AandR Management Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
The term of this Agreement (the "Term") shall begin at the Effective Time and
end at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 31, 2021, unless this Agreement
is terminated before that time pursuant to Section 14(a) or Section 15 of this
Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 15(b) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Manager, on the
date on which such termination is effective, a termination fee (the
"Termination Fee") equal to the amount of the Management Fee earned by the
Manager during the period consisting of the 12 full, consecutive calendar
months immediately preceding such termination.

(c) Section 3(a), Section 11, Section 13(b), this Section 13(c), Section
16 and Section 29 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the
obligation of the Company to pay the accrued and unpaid Incentive
Compensation shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this
Agreement.

SECTION 14. ASSIGNMENT. 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 14(b) of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment, in whole or in
part, by the Manager, unless such assignment is consented to in writing by the
Company with the consent of a majority of the Independent Directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such consent shall be required in the

 



14

    

 case of an assignment by the Manager to an entity whose day-to-day business
and operations are managed and supervised by Mr. Wesley R. Edens (the
"Principal"), _provided_ , _further_ , that such transaction is determined at
the time not to be an "assignment" for purposes of Section 205 of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated under such act and the interpretations thereof issued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such permitted assignment shall bind
the assignee under this Agreement in the same manner as the Manager is bound,
and the Manager shall be liable to the Company for all errors or omissions of
the assignee under any such assignment. In addition, the assignee shall
execute and deliver to the Company a counterpart of this Agreement naming
such assignee as Manager. This Agreement shall not be assigned by the Company
without the prior written consent of the Manager, except in the case of
assignment by the Company to a successor to the Company, in which case
such successor organization shall be bound under this Agreement and by the
terms of such assignment in the same manner as the Company is bound under this
Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Manager may
subcontract and assign any or all of its responsibilities under Sections
2(b), 2(c) and 2(d) of this Agreement to any of its affiliates in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement applicable to any such subcontract or
assignment, and the Company hereby consents to any such assignment and
subcontracting. In addition, provided that the Manager provides prior written
notice to the Company for informational purposes only, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall preclude any pledge, hypothecation or other transfer of
any amounts payable to the Manager under this Agreement.

SECTION 15. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.

 

(a) The Company may terminate this Agreement effective upon 60 days prior
written notice of termination from the Company to the Manager, without
payment of any Termination Fee, if any act of fraud, misappropriation of
funds, or embezzlement against the Company or other willful violation of this
Agreement by the Manager in its corporate capacity (as distinguished from the
acts of any employees of the Manager that are taken without the complicity of
the Principal) under this Agreement or in the event of any gross negligence on
the part of the Manager in the performance of its duties under this Agreement.

 

(b) The Manager may terminate this Agreement effective upon 60 days prior
written notice of termination to the Company in the event that the Company
shall default in the performance or observance of any material term, condition
or covenant contained in this Agreement and such default shall continue for a
period of 30 days after written notice thereof specifying such default and
requesting that the same be remedied in such 30 day period.

SECTION 16. ACTION UPON TERMINATION.

 

(a) From and after the conclusion of the Term, the Manager shall not be
entitled to compensation for further services under this Agreement, but shall
be paid (i) all compensation accruing prior to the conclusion of the Term and
(ii) if applicable, the Termination Fee. The previous sentence will not limit
any damages that may be awarded for a breach of this Agreement. Promptly
after the Term, the Manager shall forthwith:

 



15

    

(i) after deducting any accrued compensation and reimbursement for its
expenses to which it is then entitled, pay over to the Company or a Subsidiary
all money collected and held for the account of the Company or a Subsidiary
pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(ii) deliver to the Board of Directors a full accounting, including a
statement showing all payments collected by it and a statement of all money
held by it, covering the period following the date of the last accounting
furnished to the Board of Directors with respect to the Company or a
Subsidiary;

 

(iii) deliver to the Board of Directors all property and documents
(including books and records) of the Company or any Subsidiary then in the
custody of the Manager; and

(iv) if applicable, enter into an appropriate intellectual property
assignment agreement with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in a form
customary for circumstances of this nature and on terms mutually agreed by the
Company and the Manager, which assignment agreement will provide for the use
and ownership of intellectual property created or used by the parties during
the Term in connection with the provision of services by the Manager to the
Company hereunder and primarily related to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) [Reserved]

 

SECTION 17. RELEASE OF MONEY OR OTHER PROPERTY UPON WRITTEN REQUEST.

 

The Manager agrees that any money or other property of the Company or
Subsidiary held by the Manager under this Agreement shall be held by
the Manager as custodian for the Company or Subsidiary, and the Managers
records shall be appropriately marked clearly to reflect the ownership of such
money or other property by the Company or such Subsidiary. Upon the receipt by
the Manager of a written request signed by a duly authorized officer of the
Company requesting the Manager to release to the Company or any Subsidiary any
money or other property then held by the Manager for the account of the
Company or any Subsidiary under this Agreement, the Manager shall release
such money or other property to the Company or any Subsidiary within a
reasonable period of time, but in no event later than 60 days following such
request. The Manager shall not be liable to the Company, any Subsidiary, the
Independent Directors, or the Companys or a Subsidiarys stockholders or
partners for any acts performed or omissions to act by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the money or other property released to
the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with the first sentence of this
Section 17\. The Company and any Subsidiary shall indemnify the Manager and
its members, managers, officers and employees against any and all expenses,
losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature
whatsoever, which arise in connection with the Managers release of such money
or other property to the Company or any Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of this Section 17. Indemnification pursuant to this provision shall be
in addition to any right of the Manager to indemnification under Section 11 of
this Agreement.

Exhibit AForm of Award Agreement

 

[Attached]

   

NEW MEDIA INVESTMENT GROUP INC.

 

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN

 

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

 

This NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), by and between
NEW MEDIA INVESTMENT GROUP INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and
FORTRESS OPERATING ENTITY I LP, a Delaware limited partnership and an
affiliate of the Manager of the Company (the "Optionee"), shall be effective
from and after the Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Amended and
Restated Management and Advisory Agreement entered into on August 5, 2019 by
the Company and FIG LLC (the "Manager"), as amended from time to time, the
"Management Agreement").

 

Pursuant to the New Media Investment Group Inc. Nonqualified Stock Option and
Incentive Award Plan (as amended from time to time, the "Plan"), the Optionee
is hereby granted, on the terms and conditions set forth herein (and subject
to the terms and provisions of the Plan), a nonqualified stock option (an
"Option") to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the "Common Stock"). It is intended that the Option constitute a
"nonqualified stock option" and not an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Any
capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the
Plan.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OPTION

1\. NUMBER OF SHARES AND OPTION PRICE. The Option entitles the Optionee to
purchase 3,163,264 shares of Common Stock (the "Option Shares") at a per
share exercise price of $15.50 (the "Option Price"), subject to adjustment as
set forth in the Plan.

 

2. TERM OF OPTION. This Agreement and the terms of the Option hereunder shall commence at the Effective Time and, unless previously terminated pursuant to this Agreement, the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of ten (10) years from the Effective Time. Upon the termination of the Option, all rights of the Optionee hereunder with respect to the Option shall cease. 

3. CONDITIONS OF EXERCISE. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the Option shall be fully vested at all times, and shall become exercisable as to all of the Option Shares from and after the Exercise Date. The "Exercise Date" shall be the earlier of (a) the first trading day immediately following the first 20 consecutive trading day period in which the closing price of the Common Stock (on its principal U.S. national securities exchange) was at or above $20 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Option Price as set forth in the Plan) and (b) the date on which the Common Stock is not publicly traded on a U.S. national securities exchange; provided, however, that the Board (acting through the Independent Directors (as defined in the Management Agreement)) may at any time and by written notice to the Optionee waive the "Exercise Date" conditions and accelerate the "Exercise Date". 

   

4. EXERCISE OF OPTION. The Option shall be exercised in full or in part in the following manner from and after the occurrence, or waiver by the Board, of the Exercise Date: the Optionee (or any subsequent party or parties having the right to exercise the Option) shall deliver to the Company written notice, in the form attached hereto, specifying the number of Option Shares to be purchased, together with payment of the aggregate Option Price of the Option Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised by means of one of the following payment methods: (a) payment of cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Option Price, (b) delivery to the Company of a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate Option Price, (c) payment or delivery of any combination of cash or shares of Common Stock, the sum of which equals the aggregate Option Price or (d) by electing to have the Company withhold from the delivery of the Option Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option the number of Option Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate Option Price. The Option Shares purchased shall thereupon be promptly delivered. In addition, the Optionee (or such other party) shall be entitled to exercise the Option in any other manner permitted under the Plan and approved by the Committee. The Optionee will not be deemed to be a holder of any Option Shares until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate (or notation in book entry) to it for such shares and until such shares are paid for in full. 

5. DISPOSITION OF OPTION SHARES. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the Option and the Common Stock acquired in connection with the exercise of the Option shall be freely transferable by the Optionee, to the extent not prohibited by applicable laws. 

6. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Option shall become immediately and fully vested and exercisable upon a Change in Control in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Management Agreement).
