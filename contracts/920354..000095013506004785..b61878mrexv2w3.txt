                           AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 3,
                  2006 (this "Agreement"), by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
                  MACHINES CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("Parent"),

                  WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub
deems it in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate
the merger (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, of Sub with and into the Company in which the Company would
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and such Boards of Directors have
adopted this Agreement (and, in the case of the Board of Directors of the
Company, recommended that this Agreement be approved by the Company's
stockholders);

                  WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

                  WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and
as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement,
certain employees of the Company have executed offer letters (the "Offer
Letters") regarding the employment of such employees following the consummation
of the Merger; and

                  WHEREAS concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and
as a condition to the willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, Parent
has entered into agreements pursuant to which certain stockholders and employees
have agreed, among other things, to certain non-competition, non-solicitation
and no hire restrictions.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the

another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company;
provided, however, that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not

total number of shares of stock that the Surviving Corporation is authorized to

                  SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Sub immediately

                                   ARTICLE II

                            Conversion of Securities

                  SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock"), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub:

                  (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
         common stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into
         and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
         value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All
         shares of Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the
         Company or owned by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective
         Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
         exist and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
         exchange therefor.

                  (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company
         Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
         Time (after giving effect to the purchase described in Section 5.04(b)
         with respect to the ESPP and other than (i) shares to be canceled and
         retired in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and (ii) Restricted Shares
         to the extent set forth in Section 5.04) shall be converted into the
         right to receive $25.80 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
         Consideration"). At the Effective Time such shares shall no longer be
         outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
         exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
         Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall
         cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
         receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
         Agreement. The right of any holder of any share of Company Common Stock
         to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
         the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax
         Law, such withholding to be pursuant to the terms of Section 2.02(f)
         hereof and any other requirements under applicable Tax Law.

                  SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent.

reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and,
from time to time after the Effective Time,

Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the
times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all
interest or other amounts earned with respect to funds made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.

                  (b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held
by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Sub shall take any action
that would prevent the Paying Agent from making payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with its customary procedures. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer books of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting `such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

                  (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

                  (d) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash which would
otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate which is delivered to
a public official in accordance


                                       4
<PAGE>

with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

                  (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in
respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate.

                  (f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

                  SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
Except as set forth in the Company Letter (with specific reference to the
section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure
relates; provided that information contained in any section of the Company
Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this
Agreement to the extent that it is readily apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such information is applicable to such other section of this
Agreement) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and
Sub as follows:

                           (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each
                  of the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly
                  organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
                  Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (except, in the
                  case of good standing, for entities organized under


                                       5
<PAGE>

                  the Laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize such
                  concept), (ii) has all requisite corporate, company,
                  partnership or other organizational power and authority to
                  carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly
                  qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing
                  in each jurisdiction (except, in the case of good standing,
                  any jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) in
                  which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
                  operation of its properties makes such qualification or
                  licensing necessary or desirable, other than where the failure
                  to be so organized, existing, qualified or licensed or in good
                  standing (except in the case of clause (i) above with respect
                  to the Company), individually or in the aggregate, is not
                  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
                  Company. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
                  accurate copies of the Company Articles and the Bylaws of the
                  Company, as amended (the "Company Bylaws") and the certificate
                  of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational
                  documents) of each of the Subsidiaries, in each case as
                  amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made
                  available to Parent and its representatives complete and
                  accurate copies of the minutes (or, in the case of draft
                  minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of
                  the stockholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of
                  the Board of Directors of the Company and each of the
                  Subsidiaries held since October 1, 2003.

                           (b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the Company
                  Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of each
                  Subsidiary and its place of organization. All the outstanding
                  shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
                  interests in, each such Subsidiary are owned by the Company,
                  by one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries or by the Company and
                  one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
                  pledges, claims, liens, charges, options to purchase, security
                  interests or other encumbrances of any kind or nature
                  whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), except for transfer
                  restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws and are
                  duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
                  Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting
                  interests in, the Subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
                  directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity
                  or voting interests in, any person.

                           (c) Capital Structure. (i) The authorized capital
                  stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company
                  Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par
                  value $0.01 per share of the Company (the "Company Preferred
                  Stock"). At the close of business on July 17, 2006, (A)
                  26,624,356 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury
                  shares) were issued and outstanding, including 431,991 shares
                  of Company Common Stock that are subject to transfer
                  restrictions and subject to forfeiture back to the Company or
                  repurchase by the Company pursuant to agreements with the
                  Company ( "Restricted Shares"), (B) 11,699 shares of Company
                  Common Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares, (C)
                  4,786,129 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
                  outstanding


                                       6

                  options (other than rights under the Company's 2002 Employee
                  Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")) to acquire shares of Company
                  Common Stock pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated
                  1999 Equity Incentive Plan (the "1999 Equity Incentive Plan")
                  and the Company's 1994 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option
                  Plan (the "1994 Stock Option Plan") (such plans, together with
                  the ESPP, the "Company Stock Plans") (together with any other
                  stock options granted after July 17, 2006 under the Company
                  Stock Plans pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
                  disclosed in the Company Letter, the "Stock Options") and (D)
                  543,071 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and
                  available for issuance by the Company pursuant to the ESPP.
                  Other than the Company Stock Plans, there is no Contract, plan
                  or other arrangement providing for the grant of options
                  exercisable for or into shares of Company Common Stock by the
                  Company or any of the Subsidiaries. No shares of Company
                  Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. No shares of
                  Company Common Stock are owned by any Subsidiary. The Company
                  has made available to Parent (A) a complete and accurate list,
                  as of the close of business on July 17, 2006, of all
                  outstanding Stock Options, the number of shares subject to
                  each such Stock Option, the grant date, exercise price and
                  expiration date of each such Stock Option and the name of the
                  holder thereof and an indication of whether or not such Stock
                  Option was intended at the time of grant to qualify as an
                  "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code and (B)
                  a complete and accurate list, as of the close of business on
                  July 17, 2006, of all Restricted Shares, the grant dates, the
                  names of the holders thereof and the form of Restricted Share
                  grant agreement, and any Restricted Share grant agreements
                  that differ in any material respect from such form, pursuant
                  to which each Restricted Share was granted. As of the date of
                  this Agreement, other than pursuant to the Stock Options,
                  rights under the ESPP, the Restricted Shares and the Company's
                  Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchase rights
                  (the "Company Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement
                  dated January 27, 1998, between the Company and BankBoston,
                  N.A. (the "Company Rights Agreement"), there are no
                  outstanding rights of any person to receive from the Company
                  Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans or
                  otherwise, on a deferred basis or otherwise. Based upon the
                  assumptions set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i) of the Company
                  Letter, and further assuming that the fair market value per
                  share of Company Common Stock on the last day of the ESPP
                  Offering Period will be equal to the Merger Consideration, the
                  Company estimates that 24,853 shares of Company Common Stock
                  will be issued under the ESPP immediately prior to the
                  Effective Time pursuant to the exercise of purchase rights by
                  participants in the current ESPP Offering Period.

                  (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(c)(i), as of the
         close of business on July 17, 2006, no shares of capital stock of, or
         other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or options, warrants,
         shares of deferred stock, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation
         rights, phantom stock awards or other rights to acquire any such stock
         or securities or similar rights that are linked to the value of the


                                       7
<PAGE>

         Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof,
         in each case issued by the Company, were outstanding. From July 17,
         2006 to the date of this Agreement, (A) there have been no issuances by
         the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
         interests in, the Company other than issuances of shares of Company
         Common Stock and attached Company Rights pursuant to the exercise of
         Stock Options or rights under the ESPP, in each case outstanding as of
         July 17, 2006 and only if and to the extent required by their terms as
         in effect on July 17, 2006 and (B) there have been no issuances by the
         Company of options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted
         stock awards, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards, other
         rights to acquire shares of capital stock or other equity or voting
         interests from the Company or other rights that are linked to the value
         of Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part
         thereof, other than rights under the ESPP.

                  (iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
         are, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock
         Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly
         authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
         subject to preemptive rights. There are no (A) bonds, debentures, notes
         or other indebtedness of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and
         (B) except as set forth in this Section 3.01(c), securities or other
         instruments or obligations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
         in each case under clause (A) or (B), the value of which is in any way
         based upon or derived from any capital stock of, or other equity or
         voting interests in, the Company or which has or which by its terms may
         have at any time (whether actual or contingent) the right to vote (or
         which is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
         right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company or
         any of the Subsidiaries may vote. Except (1) as set forth in this
         Section 3.01(c) and (2) for rights under the ESPP, the Company Rights
         Agreement or the Stock Options in effect as of the date of this
         Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants, calls, rights or
         Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
         is a party, or by which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
         bound, obligating the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to issue,
         deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
         shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or
         securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares
         of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
         Company or any of the Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of
         the Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
         security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. With respect to the
         Stock Options, (u) each Stock Option intended to qualify as an
         "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies,
         (v) each grant of a Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the
         date on which the grant of such Stock Option was by its terms to be
         effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action,
         including, as applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of the
         Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and
         any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or
         written consents, (w) the award agreement governing such grant (if any)
         was duly delivered by the Company to the recipient, (x) each such grant
         was made in


                                       8
<PAGE>

         accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plan under which it was
         issued, the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and regulatory
         rules or requirements, including the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select
         Market or any other exchange on which Company securities are traded,
         (y) the per share exercise price of each Stock Option was greater than
         or equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on
         the applicable Grant Date and (z) each such grant was properly
         accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
         (including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the
         Company's Filed SEC Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act and
         all other applicable Laws. Except for the Restricted Shares outstanding
         as of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual
         or other obligations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to (A)
         repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of,
         or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of the
         Subsidiaries or (B) vote or dispose of any shares of capital stock of,
         or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of the
         Subsidiaries. The Company is not a party to any voting agreements with
         respect to any shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
         interests in, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and, to the
         knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement there are no
         irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any shares
         of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
         Company or any of the Subsidiaries. All Stock Options and Restricted
         Shares may be treated in accordance with Section 5.04(a).

                  (iv) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any
         (A) indebtedness for borrowed money, (B) indebtedness evidenced by any
         bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture or other debt instrument or
         debt security, (C) accounts payable to trade creditors and accrued
         expenses not arising in the ordinary course of business, (D) amounts
         owing as deferred purchase price for the purchase of any property
         (other than accounts payable, accrued expenses and amounts owing
         referred to in clauses (C) and (D) taken in the aggregate which do not
         exceed $350,000) or (E) guarantees with respect to any indebtedness or
         obligation of a type described in clauses (A) through (D) above of any
         other person (other than, in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (D),
         accounts payable to trade creditors and accrued expenses arising in the
         ordinary course of business) (collectively, "indebtedness", which term
         shall exclude any indebtedness of the Company or any wholly-owned
         Subsidiary to any wholly-owned Subsidiary or of any wholly-owned
         Subsidiary to the Company).

                           (d) Authority; Noncontravention. The Company has the
                  requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
                  this Agreement, to consummate the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject to
                  obtaining the Stockholder Approval) and to comply with the
                  provisions of this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
                  this Agreement by the Company, the consummation by the Company
                  of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement and the compliance by the Company with the
                  provisions of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
                  necessary corporate action on the part of the Company

                  purpose or intended or known result or effect of such joint
                  venture, partnership or Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
                  material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,

                  such Subsidiary's published financial statements or other SEC
                  Documents.

                  reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
                  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time

                  1, 2005, none of the Major Customers or Major Suppliers has

                  amendment to any of its Major Customer Contracts or Major
                  Supplier Contracts (other than renewals and amendments in the
                  ordinary course of business not adverse in any material
                  respect to the Company or any Subsidiary), with the Company or
                  any of the Subsidiaries.

         businesses as presently conducted. The Company and the Subsidiaries
         have complied and are in compliance in all material respects with all

         or Judgments which are the subject of representations made in Sections
         3.01(e), (l), (m) and (n). The execution and delivery of this Agreement
         by the Company does not, and the consummation by the Company of the
         Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
         compliance by the Company with the terms of this Agreement are not
         reasonably likely to, cause the revocation or cancelation of any
         material Permit. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of
         the Subsidiaries has received any written communication during the past
         three years from any person that alleges that the Company or any of the
         Subsidiaries is not in compliance in all material respects with, or is
         subject to liability under, any material Permit, Law or Judgment or
         relating to the revocation or modification of any material Permit. As
         of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has
         received any written notice that any investigation or review by any
         Governmental Entity is pending with respect to the Company or any of
         the Subsidiaries or any of the assets or operations of the Company or
         any of the Subsidiaries or that any such investigation or review is
         contemplated, other than any audit, examination or review of any Tax
         Return in the ordinary course of business.

                  (k) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans; Employment
         Agreements; Labor Relations. (i) Except as disclosed in the Filed SEC

         Subsidiaries has adopted, entered into, terminated, amended, modified
         or agreed to adopt, enter into, terminate, amend or modify (or
         announced an intention to adopt, enter into, terminate, amend or

         subject to the Laws of the United States), sponsored, maintained,
         contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to by the
         Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any other person that, together
         with the Company, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b),
         (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or with respect to which the Company is

         "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case, providing compensation or
         benefits to any Company Personnel, but not including the Benefit
         Agreements (all such plans, programs, arrangements and understandings,
         including any such plan, program, arrangement or understanding entered
         into or adopted on or after the date of this Agreement, collectively,
         "Benefit Plans"), or has made any change in any actuarial or other
         assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any
         Pension Plan, or any change in the manner in which contributions to any

                  organizing activity, or had any actual or threatened employee
                  strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts. As of the date
                  of this Agreement, none of the employees of the Company or any
                  of the Subsidiaries is represented by any union with respect
                  to his or her employment by the Company or such Subsidiary.

                  labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or any
                  of the Subsidiaries that is pending and, to the knowledge of
                  the Company, there is no unfair labor practice charge or

                  threatened, in each case before the National Labor Relations
                  Board or any comparable Governmental Entity.

         Environmental Claims the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has, or may
         have, retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of Law;
         (E) neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has retained or

         Company, were there any underground storage tanks on, under or about

         Subsidiaries; and (H) there are no past or present events, conditions,

         Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any
         unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements, descriptions thereof),
         (B) the two most recent annual reports, or such similar reports,
         statements, information returns or material correspondence required to
         be filed, with or delivered to any Governmental Entity, if any, with
         respect to each Benefit Plan (including reports filed on Form 5500),
         (C) the most recent summary plan description (if any), and any summary
         of material modifications prepared for each Benefit Plan for which such
         summary plan description is required under applicable Law and (D) each
         trust agreement and group annuity or insurance Contract and other
         documents relating to the funding or payment of compensation or
         benefits under any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement. Each Benefit Plan
         has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its
         terms. The Company and the Subsidiaries and all the Benefit Plans are
         in compliance in all material respects with applicable Law, including
         ERISA and the Code.

                           (ii) All Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified
                  under the Code are so qualified and have been the subject of
                  favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue
                  Service (the "IRS") with respect to all Tax Law changes with
                  respect to which the IRS is currently willing to provide a
                  determination letter to the effect that such Pension Plans are
                  qualified and exempt from United States Federal income Taxes
                  under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code,
                  and no such determination letter has been revoked (nor, to the
                  knowledge of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, has
                  revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since
                  the date of the most recent determination letter or
                  application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that is
                  reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualification of
                  such Pension Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or
                  require security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Pension Plans
                  required to have been approved by any non-United States
                  Governmental Entity (or permitted to have been approved to
                  obtain any beneficial tax or other status) have been so
                  approved or timely submitted for approval, no such approval
                  has been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of the Company as of
                  the date of this


                                       25
<PAGE>

                  Agreement, has revocation been threatened) and no event has
                  occurred since the date of the most recent approval or
                  application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that is
                  reasonably likely to affect any such approval relating thereto
                  or increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has made
                  available to Parent a copy of the most recent determination or
                  approval letter received with respect to each Pension Plan, as
                  well as a copy of each pending application for a determination
                  or approval letter, if any.

                           (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled
                  Entity has sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been
                  obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or
                  contingent liability under, any Benefit Plan that is subject
                  to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
                  or is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or that
                  provides for the payment of termination indemnities.

                           (iv) No Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement that
                  provides welfare benefits (each, a "Welfare Plan") is funded
                  through a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in
                  Section 419(e) of the Code), or is unfunded or self-insured.
                  There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings,
                  written or oral, that would prevent any Welfare Plan
                  (including any Welfare Plan covering retirees or other former
                  employees) from being amended or terminated without material
                  liability to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries on or at
                  any time after the Effective Time. No Welfare Plan provides
                  benefits after termination of employment, except where the
                  cost thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his
                  or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries) or as required by
                  Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

                           (v) Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter sets
                  forth a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this
                  Agreement, of (A) each Benefit Plan and each Benefit Agreement
                  pursuant to which any Company Personnel could become entitled
                  to any additional compensation, severance or other benefits or
                  any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
                  compensation, severance or other benefits as a result of the
                  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event) or
                  termination of employment, or any benefits the value of which
                  would be calculated on the basis of the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
                  combination with any other event), (B) the names of all
                  Company Personnel entitled to any such compensation or
                  benefits actually payable as of the Closing Date or upon
                  termination of employment after the Closing Date and the
                  category or type of each such form of compensation or benefit
                  to which such Company Personnel is entitled, (C) the aggregate
                  value of each such form of compensation or benefit actually
                  payable as of the Closing Date and each such form of
                  compensation or benefit that would be payable upon termination
                  of employment or otherwise after the


                                       26
<PAGE>

                  Closing Date, in each case, to all Company Personnel, and (D)
                  the aggregate value of any such compensation or benefits that
                  would be paid to each individual set forth in Section
                  3.01(m)(v) of the Company Letter as of the Closing Date and
                  upon termination of employment. Except as expressly set forth
                  in the Offer Letters or in Section 5.04, no Company Personnel
                  will be entitled to any severance, change in control,
                  termination, bonus or other additional compensation or
                  benefits from or on behalf of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries or any acceleration of the time of payment or
                  vesting of any compensation or benefits from or on behalf of
                  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
                  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event) or
                  any compensation or benefits from or on behalf of the Company
                  or any of its Subsidiaries related to or contingent upon, or
                  the value of which will be calculated on the basis of, the
                  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event). The
                  execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
                  the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event) and
                  compliance by the Company with the provisions of this
                  Agreement do not and will not (A) trigger any funding (through
                  a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or increase the cost of, or
                  give rise to any other obligation under, any Benefit Plan,
                  Benefit Agreement or any other employment arrangement, (B)
                  trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any Company
                  Personnel to the Company or any of its affiliates or (C)
                  result in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or
                  without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or limit to
                  the Company's ability to amend, modify or terminate any
                  Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.

                           (vi) No deduction of any amount payable pursuant to
                  the terms of the Benefit Plans, Benefit Agreements or any
                  other employment arrangements has been disallowed or is
                  subject to disallowance under Section 162(m) of the Code.

                           (vii) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
                  Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received written
                  notice of, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no,
                  pending investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect
                  to, or pending termination proceedings or other material
                  claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
                  operation of the Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against
                  or involving any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement or
                  asserting any rights or claims to benefits under, any Benefit
                  Plan or Benefit Agreement.

                           (viii) All contributions, premiums and benefit
                  payments under or in connection with the Benefit Plans or
                  Benefit Agreements that are required to have been made by the
                  Company or any of the Subsidiaries have been timely made.
                  Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has


                                       27
<PAGE>

                  incurred, or could reasonably be expected to incur, any
                  unfunded liabilities in relation to any Benefit Plan or
                  Benefit Agreement.

                           (ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has
                  not occurred any prohibited transaction in which the Company,
                  any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
                  directors or employees or, to the knowledge of the Company as
                  of the date of this Agreement, any trustee or other fiduciary
                  or administrator of any Benefit Plan or trust created
                  thereunder, in each case, who is not an officer, director or
                  employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (a
                  "Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary"), has engaged that is
                  reasonably likely to subject the Company, any of the
                  Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or
                  employees or any Non-Affiliate Plan Fiduciary, to the tax or
                  penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of
                  the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or
                  any other applicable Law and (B) none of the Company, any of
                  the Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
                  directors or employees, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
                  as of the date of this Agreement, any Non-Affiliate Plan
                  Fiduciary, nor any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged
                  in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a
                  manner, that is reasonably likely to subject the Company, any
                  Subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company,
                  as of the date of this Agreement, any Non-Affiliate Plan
                  Fiduciary to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty under
                  ERISA or any other applicable Law.

                           (x) The Company and the Subsidiaries do not have any
                  liability or obligations (other than immaterial liabilities or
                  obligations), including under or on account of a Benefit Plan
                  or Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to
                  provide services to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and
                  treating such persons as consultants or independent
                  contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries.

                  (n) Taxes. (i) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has
         timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it and
         all such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material
         respects. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has timely paid all
         material Taxes due and owing, and the most recent financial statements
         contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve, in
         accordance with GAAP, for all material Taxes payable by the Company and
         the Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through
         the date of such financial statements.

                           (ii) As of the date of this Agreement, no material
                  Tax Return of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
                  currently under audit or examination by any Taxing Authority,
                  and no written notice of such an audit or examination has been
                  received by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. There is
                  no material deficiency, refund litigation, proposed


                                       28
<PAGE>

                  adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes
                  due and owing by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. Each
                  deficiency resulting from any completed audit or examination
                  or concluded litigation relating to Taxes by any Taxing
                  Authority has been timely paid. As of the date of this
                  Agreement, no issues relating to Taxes were raised by the
                  relevant Taxing Authority during any presently pending audit
                  or examination, and no issues relating to Taxes were raised by
                  the relevant Taxing Authority in any completed audit or
                  examination, that are reasonably likely to recur in a later
                  taxable period, except for issues that individually or in the
                  aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a material
                  liability for the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. The
                  relevant statute of limitations is closed with respect to the
                  U.S. federal income Tax Returns of the Company and the
                  Subsidiaries for all tax years ending on or before December
                  31, 1998.

                           (iii) There is no currently effective agreement or
                  other document extending, or having the effect of extending,
                  the period of assessment or collection of any material Taxes
                  and no currently effective power of attorney (other than
                  powers of attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act
                  on behalf of the Company) with respect to any material Taxes
                  has been executed or filed with any Taxing Authority.

                           (iv) No material Liens for Taxes exist with respect
                  to any assets or properties of the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due
                  and Liens for Taxes that the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries is contesting in good faith through appropriate
                  proceedings and for which adequate reserves, in accordance
                  with GAAP, have been established.

                           (v) None of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is
                  a party to or bound by any Tax sharing agreement, Tax
                  indemnity obligation or similar agreement, arrangement or
                  practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
                  agreement, closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the
                  Code, or other agreement relating to Taxes with any Taxing
                  Authority).

                           (vi) None of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
                  will be required to include in a taxable period ending after
                  the Effective Time a material amount of taxable income
                  attributable to income that accrued (for purposes of the
                  financial statements of the Company included in the Filed SEC
                  Documents) in a prior taxable period but was not recognized
                  for Tax purposes in any prior taxable period as a result of
                  the installment method of accounting, the completed contract
                  method of accounting, the long-term contract method of
                  accounting, the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of
                  the Code or comparable provisions of any Tax Law, or for any
                  other reason (including as a result of prepaid amounts or
                  deferred revenue received on or prior to the Effective Time).

                           (vii) Other than agreements pursuant to which the
                  Company or a Subsidiary may be required to make payments to
                  persons set forth on Section 3.01(n)(vii) of the Company
                  Letter (the "Primary Company Executives"), neither the Company
                  nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Contract that could
                  result in the payment of any amount or other entitlement
                  (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a
                  result of the Merger (alone or in combination with any other
                  event) to any person who is a "disqualified individual" (as
                  defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect
                  to the Company, which payment would be characterized as an
                  "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
                  of the Code). The Company has provided Parent with
                  documentation evidencing the "base amount" (as defined in
                  Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary Company

         the Company and the Subsidiaries as presently conducted and as proposed

                  estate or any interest therein.

                           (v) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is in
                  compliance in all material respects with the terms of all
                  material leases to Leased Real Property to which it is a party

                  lease is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company
                  or a Subsidiary, as the case may be and, to the knowledge of
                  the Company, of each other party thereto, enforceable against
                  the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to

                  bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
                  moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement
                  of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
                  equity. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries enjoys
                  peaceful and undisturbed possession in all material respects
                  under all the leases to Leased Real Property to which it is a
                  party and under which it is in occupancy.

                           Intellectual Property that is owned or intended to be
                           owned by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
                           except where the failure to do so is not reasonably
                           likely to have a material adverse effect on a
                           material product or service of the Company or any
                           Subsidiary or to result in a material liability to
                           the Company or any Subsidiary, and none of the former
                           or current members of management or key personnel of
                           the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, including all
                           former and current employees, agents, consultants and
                           independent contractors known to the Company to have
                           contributed to or participated in the conception and
                           development of Intellectual Property owned or
                           intended to be owned by the Company or any of the
                           Subsidiaries, has a valid claim against the Company
                           or any of the Subsidiaries in connection with the
                           involvement of such person in the conception and
                           development of any material Intellectual Property
                           that is owned or intended to be owned by the Company
                           or any of the Subsidiaries, and no such claim is
                           pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
                           threatened, in each case other than claims that are
                           not reasonably likely to have a material adverse
                           effect on a material product or service of the
                           Company or any Subsidiary or to result in a material
                           liability to the Company or any Subsidiary. To the
                           knowledge of the Company, none of the current
                           employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
                           has any patents issued or applications pending for
                           any device, process, design or invention of any kind
                           now used or needed by the Company or any of the
                           Subsidiaries in furtherance of their business as
                           presently conducted, which patents or applications
                           have not been assigned (or are not contractually
                           obligated to be assigned) to the Company or any of
                           the Subsidiaries.

                                    provisions of this Agreement will not,
                                    conflict with, or result in any violation

                                    with respect to which the Company or any of
                                    the Subsidiaries now has any agreement with
                                    any third party, or any right of
                                    termination, cancellation or acceleration of

                                    which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
                                    is a party, or the loss or encumbrance of
                                    any material Intellectual Property or
                                    material benefit related thereto, or result
                                    in the creation of any Lien in or upon any
                                    material Intellectual Property or right,
                                    except for such conflicts, violations,
                                    defaults, rights, licenses, losses,
                                    encumbrances or Liens as are not reasonably
                                    likely to have a material adverse effect on
                                    a material product or service of the Company
                                    or any Subsidiary or to result in a material
                                    liability to the Company or any Subsidiary.

                                             (H) To the extent Third Party
                                    Software is (I) currently distributed to
                                    customers of the Company or any of the
                                    Subsidiaries by the Company or any of the
                                    Subsidiaries or (II) made available by the
                                    Company or any of the Subsidiaries to
                                    customers of the Company or any of the
                                    Subsidiaries under a hosting, outsourcing or
                                    similar arrangement, (1) the Company and the
                                    Subsidiaries have obtained all licenses
                                    necessary for such distribution or making
                                    available, except where the failure to
                                    obtain any such license is not reasonably
                                    likely to have a material adverse effect on
                                    a material product or service of the Company
                                    or any Subsidiary or to result in a material
                                    liability to the Company or any Subsidiary,
                                    (2) the Company's use of such Third Party
                                    Software has not obligated the Company to
                                    make any source code of the Company
                                    available to any third party and (3) no
                                    royalties or payments in excess of $100,000
                                    are due. Section 3.01(p)(ii)(H) of the
                                    Company Letter contains a complete list of
                                    such material Third Party Software, and
                                    identifies the Contract pursuant to which

                                    trade secrets with respect to which the
                                    Company knowingly made a business judgment
                                    prior to the date of this Agreement to not
                                    keep such trade secrets confidential) of the
                                    Company or any of the Subsidiaries has been
                                    published or disclosed by the Company or any
                                    of the Subsidiaries to any third party,
                                    except pursuant to a written non-disclosure
                                    Contract or covenant, or, to the knowledge
                                    of the Company, by any third party to any
                                    other third party, except pursuant to
                                    licenses or other Contracts or covenants
                                    requiring such third party to keep such
                                    trade secrets confidential, in each case
                                    subject to customary and commercially
                                    reasonable exceptions.

                                             (J) Neither the Company nor any of
                                    the Subsidiaries has assigned, sold or
                                    otherwise transferred ownership of any
                                    material issued patent, patent application,
                                    registered trademark or application
                                    therefor, service mark, registered copyright
                                    or application therefor or any other
                                    material Intellectual Property since October
                                    1, 2003, other than assignments, sales or
                                    transfers between or among the Company and
                                    its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

                                             (K) No licenses or rights have been
                                    granted to a third party to distribute the
                                    source code for, or to use any source code
                                    to create Derivative Works of, any product
                                    currently marketed by, commercially
                                    available from or under development by the
                                    Company or any of the Subsidiaries for which
                                    the Company possesses the source code.

                                             (L) Each of the Company and the
                                    Subsidiaries has created and has safely
                                    stored in a commercially reasonable manner
                                    back-up copies of all the material Software
                                    of the Company and each of the Subsidiaries.

                           (iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Derivative
                  Work" shall have the meaning set forth in 17 U.S.C. Section
                  101.

                           (iv) For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual
                  Property" shall mean Software, trademarks, service marks,
                  brand names, certification marks, trade dress, assumed names,
                  domain names, trade names and other

                  indications of business origin, the goodwill associated with
                  the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction of, and
                  applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing,
                  including any extension, modification or renewal of any such
                  registration or application; inventions, discoveries and
                  ideas, whether patentable or not in any jurisdiction; patents,
                  applications for patents (including divisions, provisionals,
                  continuations, continuations in-part and renewal

                  thereof, in any jurisdiction; non-public information, trade
                  secrets, know-how, formulae, processes, procedures, research
                  records, records of invention, software and confidential
                  information, whether patentable or not in any jurisdiction and
                  rights in any jurisdiction to limit the use or disclosure
                  thereof by any person; writings and other works, whether
                  copyrightable or not in any jurisdiction, and any renewals or
                  extensions thereof; any similar intellectual property or
                  proprietary rights; and any claims or causes of action of the
                  owner of such intellectual property or proprietary rights
                  (whether pending or threatened or which could be filed)
                  arising out of any infringement or misappropriation of any of
                  the foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, "Software"
                  shall mean all types of computer software programs, including
                  operating systems, application programs, software tools,
                  firmware and software imbedded in equipment, including both
                  object code and source code. The term "Software" shall also
                  include all written or electronic data, documentation, and
                  materials that explain the structure or use of Software or
                  that were used in the development of Software or are used in
                  the operation of the Software including logic diagrams, flow
                  charts, procedural diagrams, error reports, manuals and
                  training materials, look-up tables and databases. For purposes
                  of this Agreement, "Third Party Software" shall mean Software
                  with respect to which a third party holds any copyright or
                  other ownership right (and therefore, such Software is not
                  owned exclusively by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries).

                           (q) Receivables. As of the date of this Agreement,
                  all the Receivables (i) represent actual indebtedness or other
                  obligations incurred by the applicable account debtors and
                  (ii) have arisen from bona fide transactions. The Baseline
                  Financials reflect appropriate reserves for doubtful accounts,
                  in accordance with GAAP, as of the most recent date specified
                  therein. For purposes of this Agreement, "Receivables" shall
                  mean all receivables constituting the right of the Company or
                  any of the Subsidiaries to receive payments in respect of
                  goods or services.

                           (r) Insurance. The Company or the Subsidiaries
                  maintain policies of fire and casualty, liability and other
                  forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles and
                  against such risks and losses as are customary for businesses
                  in the Company's and the Subsidiaries' business. All such
                  insurance policies are in full force and effect, all premiums
                  due and payable thereon have been paid, and no written notice
                  of cancelation or termination has been received with respect
                  to any such policy which has not been replaced


                                       38

                  on substantially similar terms prior to the date of such
                  cancelation. There is no material claim pending under any such
                  policies as to which coverage has been disputed.

                           (s) State Takeover Statutes; Company Articles. The
                  Board of Directors of the Company has taken all actions
                  necessary, if any, so that the restrictions contained in (i)
                  Chapters 110C, 110D and 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws
                  and (ii) Article 6A of the Company Articles ("Article 6A"), in
                  each case to the extent, if any, such restrictions would
                  otherwise be applicable to the execution, delivery or
                  performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
                  or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
                  compliance with the terms of this Agreement, shall not so
                  apply. A majority of the Board of Directors of the Company and
                  a majority of the "Disinterested Directors" (as defined in
                  Article 6A) have determined (assuming the accuracy of the
                  representations and warranties of Parent and Sub in Section
                  3.02(e) below) that none of Parent, Sub or any of their
                  respective affiliates is an "Interested Stockholder" (as
                  defined in Article 6A) such that subsection (a)(1) of such
                  Article 6A would apply to the execution, delivery or
                  performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
                  or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
                  compliance with the terms hereof. No other "control share
                  acquisition", "interested stockholder", "fair price",
                  "moratorium" or other state takeover or similar statute or
                  regulation or other similar provision of the Company Articles
                  or the Company Bylaws is, or at the Effective Time will be,
                  applicable to the execution, delivery or performance of this
                  Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or compliance with
                  the terms of this Agreement.

                           (t) Company Rights Agreement. The Company has taken
                  all actions necessary to (i) render the Company Rights
                  Agreement inapplicable to the execution, delivery or
                  performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger
                  and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
                  compliance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) ensure that
                  (A) none of Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent is
                  an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Company Rights
                  Agreement), (B) a "Distribution Date" or a "Stock Acquisition
                  Date" (as such terms are defined in the Company Rights
                  Agreement) does not occur and (C) the Company Rights to
                  purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock issued
                  under the Company Rights Agreement do not become exercisable,
                  in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (C), solely by reason of
                  the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
                  consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
                  contemplated by this Agreement or compliance with the terms of
                  this Agreement and (iii) provide that the "Expiration Date"
                  (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) shall occur
                  immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
                  arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company
                  has provided Parent with complete and accurate copies of all
                  agreements under which any such fees or commissions are
                  payable and all indemnification and other agreements related
                  to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees are
                  payable. The fees and expenses of any accountant, broker,

                  Directors of the Company has received the written opinion of
                  Goldman, Sachs & Co. dated as of the date of this Agreement
                  and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company to the
                  effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, and based upon
                  and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions
                  set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by
                  the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement is
                  fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view, a
                  copy of which opinion the Company has delivered to Parent.

                           SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties of
         Parent and Sub. Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
         follows:

                           (a) Organization. Each of Parent and Sub is a
                  corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
                  standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
                  organization and has all requisite corporate power and
                  authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.

                           (b) Authority; Noncontravention. Parent and Sub have
                  the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
                  deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this

                  Agreement and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
                  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
                  Sub, the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger and the
                  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
                  compliance by Parent and Sub with the provisions of this
                  Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
                  action on the part of Parent and Sub and no other corporate
                  proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to
                  authorize this Agreement, to comply with the terms of this
                  Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement
                  has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and,
                  assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement by
                  the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
                  Parent and Sub, enforceable against Parent and Sub in
                  accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery of this
                  Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by
                  Parent and Sub with the provisions of this Agreement do not
                  and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or
                  breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time
                  or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
                  termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or
                  to a loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
                  creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or
                  assets of Parent or Sub under, or give rise to any increased,
                  additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements
                  under, any provision of (i) the Certificate of Incorporation
                  or Bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of Parent or
                  Sub, (ii) any Contract or Permit to which Parent or Sub is a
                  party or bound by or their respective properties or assets are
                  bound by or subject to or (iii) subject to the governmental
                  filings and other matters referred to in the following
                  sentence, any Law or Judgment, in each case, applicable to
                  Parent or Sub or their respective properties or assets, other
                  than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
                  conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, results,
                  losses, Liens or entitlements that individually or in the
                  aggregate are not reasonably likely to (x) impair in any
                  material respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to
                  perform its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent,
                  materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
                  Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
                  registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
                  Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Parent
                  or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this
                  Agreement by Parent and Sub, the consummation by Parent and
                  Sub of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement or the compliance by Parent and Sub with the
                  provisions of this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of a
                  premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act and
                  the filings and receipt, termination or expiration, as
                  applicable, of such other approvals or waiting periods
                  required under any other applicable competition, merger
                  control, antitrust or similar Law, (ii) the filing of the
                  Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
                  Massachusetts and appropriate documents with the relevant
                  authorities of other states in which the Company


                                       41
<PAGE>

                  or any of the Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and
                  (iii) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
                  registrations, declarations, filings and notices, the failure
                  of which to be obtained or made individually or in the
                  aggregate are not reasonably likely to impair in any material
                  respect the ability of each of Parent and Sub to perform its
                  obligations under this Agreement or prevent, materially impede
                  or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the
                  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                           (c) Information Supplied. None of the information
                  supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub specifically for
                  inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
                  will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments
                  or supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy
                  Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, at
                  the time of the Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any
                  amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement
                  of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
                  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
                  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
                  they are made, not misleading.

                           (d) Interim Operations of Sub. Sub was formed solely
                  for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has engaged in
                  no business other than in connection with the Merger and the
                  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                           (e) Beneficial Ownership of Company Stock. None of
                  Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates (other than
                  any retirement, pension, medical or other benefit plan, where
                  a fiduciary of the beneficiaries of such plan exercises
                  independent investment oversight over the assets of such plan)
                  is, or has been since August 1, 2004, the beneficial owner,
                  directly or indirectly, of more than fifteen percent (15%) of
                  the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the date
                  of determination. For purposes of this paragraph, Parent, Sub
                  and their respective affiliates shall not be deemed to be the
                  beneficial owner of any shares of Company Common Stock due to
                  the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
                  determination of "beneficial owner" shall be as set forth in
                  Article 6A.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                    Covenants Relating to Conduct of Business

         of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably delayed) or as specifically
         contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Letter, the Company
         shall, and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to, carry on their
         respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past
         practice and use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
         applicable Laws and, to the extent consistent therewith, use

         Agreement to the Effective Time, except as specifically contemplated by
         this Agreement or as set forth in Section 4.01(a) of the Company Letter

         delayed), the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of the

         solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary after the
         date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of
         this Section 4.02, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c) and
         the other provisions of this Agreement, (A) furnish or cause the
         Subsidiaries to furnish information with respect to the Company and the
         Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
         representatives) pursuant to an agreement which contains terms that are
         no less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality
         Agreement dated April 27, 2006 between Parent and the Company (as it
         may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement");
         provided that all such information had been or is provided on a prior
         or concurrent basis to Parent and (B) participate in discussions or
         negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
         representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
         restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director,
         officer or employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any
         investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
         representative of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall be
         deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub)
relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions, including
by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock
acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or
similar transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent
15% or more of the total revenue, net income, EBITDA or assets of the Company
and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Company's Subsidiaries which,
in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or businesses referred
to in clause (i) above, in each case other than the Merger.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal"
means any bona fide written offer which was unsolicited after the date of this
Agreement by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary and did not otherwise
result from a breach of Section 4.02(a) made by a third party which, if accepted
by the Company would be binding upon the third party and which, if consummated,
would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) (i) would
provide a higher value to the stockholders of the Company than the consideration
payable in the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of
such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

                  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (or shall agree, resolve or vote to) (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation by such Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend, or
propose publicly to recommend, the approval of any Takeover Proposal (any such
action or any such resolution or vote or agreement to take such action being
referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), (ii) approve or
recommend any Takeover Proposal, or propose the approval or recommendation of
any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended by the Company to
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Stockholder


                                       49
<PAGE>

Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company, or a duly authorized committee
of the Board of Directors may, and may agree, resolve or vote to, in response to
a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change, provided that the Board of Directors of the Company or such committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do
so is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and provided, further, that
the Board of Directors of the Company or such committee may not effect such an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i) the Board of Directors of the Company
or such committee shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent (an
"Adverse Recommendation Change Notice") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, attach the most
current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of an Intervening Event,
attach information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and
(ii) Parent does not make, within five business days after the receipt of such
notice, a proposal that would, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company or such committee (after consultation with a financial
advisor of national reputation and outside legal counsel), (A) cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal or (B) obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of an Intervening Event. The Company agrees that, during the five
business day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company and its officers, directors and representatives shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent and its officers, directors, and representatives regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

                  For purposes of this Agreement the term "Intervening Event"
means an event, unknown to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date
hereof (or, if known, the material consequences of which are not known to or
understood by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof),
which event (or any material consequence of which) becomes known (or understood)
to or by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Stockholder Approval
and which causes the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized
committee thereof to conclude in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that
its failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the receipt,
existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within 24 hours after the receipt
thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Takeover Proposal or any
request for information or inquiry that the Company believes in good faith could
reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal and (ii)
the terms and conditions of such Takeover


                                       50
<PAGE>

Proposal or a reasonable description (which in the good faith judgment of the
Company is complete) of such request or inquiry (including any subsequent
amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions or such request or
inquiry) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal
request or inquiry. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above, once, and not more than once, each day at mutually reasonably agreeable
times, the Company (or its outside counsel) shall (i) advise and confer with
Parent (or its outside counsel) regarding the progress of negotiations
concerning any Takeover Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved issues
related thereto and any other matters identified with reasonable specificity by
Parent (or its outside counsel) and the material details (including material
amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) of any
such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and (ii) promptly upon receipt or
delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside counsel) with copies of all
documents and written communications relating to such Takeover Proposal
exchanged between the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives,
on the one hand, and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or
other advisors or representatives, on the other hand.

                  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, failure so to disclose is reasonably likely to result in a breach of
applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or its
Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree, resolve or vote to take
any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

                  SECTION 4.03. Conduct by Parent. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing
by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to,
take any action (or knowingly omit to take any action) if such action (or known
omission) is reasonably likely to result in (a) any representation and warranty
of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (b) any such representation and warranty
that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

                                  ARTICLE V

                              Additional Agreements

                  SECTION 5.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meeting. (a) Subject to the reasonable cooperation of Parent, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and,
no later than the tenth business day following the date of this Agreement, file
with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, absent any Legal Restraint which has the
effect of preventing such action,


                                       51
<PAGE>

the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy Statement and shall
cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company to occur on or prior to the 10th calendar day (or, if such calendar day
is not a business day, the first business day subsequent to such calendar day)
immediately following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement with the
SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning such person to the other as may be reasonably requested
in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file or
mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and in any event, which approval will be provided not later than three
business days following a written request therefor. If at any time prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, shall be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. Each of Parent and the Company shall bear one-half
of the cost of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto; provided that if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred, the Company shall bear 100% of such cost.

                  (b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
that none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments or
supplements contemplated hereby), at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with
the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied or to be supplied by


                                       52
<PAGE>

Parent or Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement. Parent agrees that none of such information will (except to the
extent revised or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated hereby),
at the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, or at
the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

                  (c) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement) for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting
the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint which has the effect of preventing
such action, cause to occur on the 20th calendar day (or, if such calendar day
is not a business day, the first business day subsequent to such calendar day)
immediately following the mailing of the Proxy Statement (the "Stockholders
Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of
whether any Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at any time; provided,
however, that the Company may extend the date of the Stockholders Meeting to the
extent (and only to the extent) (i) necessary in order to obtain a quorum of its
stockholders and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
such a quorum as promptly as practicable or (ii) the Company reasonably
determines that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply with comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The notice of such
Stockholders Meeting shall state that a resolution to approve this Agreement
will be considered at the Stockholders Meeting. Subject to Section 4.02(b), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to holders of the Company
Common Stock that they approve this Agreement, and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section
5.01(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any Takeover
Proposal.

                  SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a)
Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and Judgments, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants and
other advisors and representatives all reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties,
assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits, documents, information, officers and
employees, and during such period the Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent any information concerning its
business as Parent may reasonably request (including the work papers of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, subject to the requirements of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP). Subject to compliance with applicable Laws and
Judgments, during the period prior to the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall
not be required to), following reasonable notice to the Company, contact and
interview any Company Personnel and review the personnel records and such other
information


                                       53
<PAGE>

concerning such Company Personnel as Parent may reasonably request, in each case
subject to such reasonable conditions as the Company shall specify. No
investigation by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives and no
other receipt of information by Parent or its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives
shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation or warranty of
the Company or any covenant or other provision in this Agreement; provided that
for the avoidance of doubt, the information set forth in the Company Letter
shall qualify the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III and the covenants of the Company set forth in Section 4.01, as and
to the extent provided for in the first sentence of Section 3.01 or in Section
4.01(a), as applicable. Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment,
Parent will hold, and will direct and cause its officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold,
any and all information received from the Company, the Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors and representatives confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

                  (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during
the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of the Subsidiaries to, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent,
provide Parent with (i) a materially complete and accurate list of all licenses
issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") and held by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (the "FCC Licenses"), (ii) materially
complete and accurate copies of each FCC License, (iii) if available, the
address and physical location of the device(s) covered by each FCC License, (iv)
if available, a written description of the purpose of the device(s) covered by
each FCC License, (v) materially complete and accurate copies of any Notices of
Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries and (vi) all reasonably available information in the
possession of the Company or a Subsidiary necessary for Parent to make an
independent determination that the Company and the Subsidiaries have complied
with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC Licenses
(including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change of ownership
or control of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany reorganizations) and
corporate organizational charts depicting the ownership structure of the holder
of the FCC Licenses before and after any such change of ownership or control).

                  (c) Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, cooperate to ensure an
orderly transition and integration process in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to minimize the
disruption to, and preserve the value of, the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Consultation and
Notice. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the


                                       54
<PAGE>

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of
all reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and
the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under
the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices
to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to
provide any supplemental information requested by a Governmental Entity,
including participating in meetings with officials of such entity in the course
of its review of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding of
the type described in Section 6.02(c) by any Governmental Entity or third party
and (v) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, other than consents, approvals and waivers the absence of which will
not impair the ability of Parent to conduct the material business operations of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided that Parent does
not reasonably object to not obtaining such consent, approval or waiver). In
connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent
or Sub be obligated to, and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not without
the prior written consent of Parent, agree or proffer to divest or hold
separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to,
any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or any of its subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate
in the litigation of any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Entity (i)
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or
seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its subsidiaries any damages in relation
therewith; (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates of all or any portion of the business or assets or any
product of the Company or the Subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries or to
require any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive
or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion of the business or
assets or any product of the Company or the Subsidiaries or Parent or its
subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) seeking to
directly or indirectly impose limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its
affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of,


                                       55
<PAGE>

any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, including the right to vote the Company Common Stock or
the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation on all matters properly
presented to the stockholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
respectively; or (iv) seeking to (A) directly or indirectly prohibit Parent or
any of its affiliates from effectively controlling in any respect any of the
business or operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries or (B) directly or
indirectly prevent the Company or the Subsidiaries from operating any of their
business in substantially the same manner as operated by the Company and the
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and
Parent shall provide such assistance, information and cooperation to each other
as is reasonably required to obtain any such actions, nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations or to give any such notices or to
make any such registrations, declarations and filings or to provide such
information and, in connection therewith, shall notify the other person promptly
following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any
request by any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional
information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing with, or
notice to, such Governmental Entity, shall supply the other person with copies
of all correspondence between such person or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand.

                  (b) (i) In connection with the continuing operation of the
business of the Company and the Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in
good faith on a reasonably regular basis with Parent to report material
(individually or in the aggregate) operational developments, the general status
of relationships with customers and resellers, the general status of ongoing
operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to
procedures reasonably requested by Parent; provided, however, that no such
consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

                  (ii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall
         promptly notify Parent in writing of:

                           (A) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1)
                  is, or that is reasonably likely to be, material (individually
                  or in the aggregate) to the business, assets, properties,
                  financial condition or results of operations of the Company
                  and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (2) is reasonably
                  likely to result in any condition to the transactions
                  contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 6.02 not being
                  satisfied;

                           (B) the failure of the Company to perform in any
                  material respect any obligation to be performed by it under
                  this Agreement;

                           (C) any notice or other communication from any person
                  (other than a Governmental Entity) alleging that the consent
                  of such person is


                                       56
<PAGE>

                  required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement;

                           (D) any notice or other communication from any Major
                  Customer or Major Supplier to the effect that such Major
                  Customer or Major Supplier is terminating or otherwise
                  modifying its relationship with Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries in a manner that is adverse in any material
                  respect to the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                           (E) any material notice or other material
                  communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
                  the Merger, and a copy of any such notice or communication
                  shall be furnished to Parent together with the Company's

                  or investigations commenced or threatened, against, relating
                  to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of
                  the Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this
                  Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
                  pursuant to Section 3.01(h), or that relate to the
                  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement;

provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement.

                  (iii) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Parent shall
         promptly notify the Company in writing of:

                           (A) the occurrence of any matter or event that is
                  reasonably likely to result in any condition to the
                  transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 6.03
                  not being satisfied;

                           (B) any notice or other communication from any person

                  contemplated by this Agreement;

                           (C) any material notice or other material

                  such notice or communication shall be furnished to the Company
                  together with Parent's written notice;

                           (D) any filing made by Parent with any Governmental
                  Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement, and a copy of any such filing shall be
                  furnished to the Company (other than portions of such filing
                  that include confidential information not directly related to
                  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) together with
                  Parent's written notice; and

                           (E) any actions, suits or proceedings commenced or,
                  to its knowledge, threatened, or, to its knowledge, any claims
                  or investigations commenced or threatened, that relate to the
                  Company or any Subsidiary or the consummation of the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement.

                (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parent's expense,
in the defense of any claim or litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any
such claim or litigation, it being understood and agreed that this Section
5.03(c) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense.

                SECTION 5.04. Equity Awards. (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the

(including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to effect the
following:

                  (i) (A) not less than 10 days prior to the Effective Time,
         each outstanding Stock Option shall automatically accelerate so that
         each such Stock Option shall become fully exercisable for all shares of
         Company Common Stock at the time subject to such Stock Option and may
         be exercised by the holder thereof for any or all of such shares, (B)
         upon the Effective Time, all outstanding Stock Options under the 1994
         Stock Option Plan shall be canceled, with the holder of each Stock
         Option becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights
         of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (x) the
         excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
         share of Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option, multiplied
         by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
         Stock Option; provided that all amounts payable pursuant to this clause
         (i) shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes or proof of
         eligibility for exemption therefrom and shall be paid at or as soon as
         practicable following the Effective Time, without interest and (C) each
         holder of a Stock Option that is outstanding as of the Effective Time
         under the


                                       58
<PAGE>

         1999 Equity Incentive Plan (each, a "1999 Option") shall no longer have
         an option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock immediately
         following the Effective Time pursuant to such 1999 Option, and in lieu
         thereof, such holder shall have the right to receive, on the same terms
         and conditions as were applicable to such 1999 Option (including
         exercise, expiration and forfeiture), an amount in cash, if any, equal
         to (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
         exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that was subject to
         such 1999 Option, multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company
         Common Stock that were subject to such 1999 Option immediately prior to
         the Effective Time; provided that all amounts payable pursuant to this
         clause (C) shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes or
         proof of eligibility for exemption therefrom;

                  (ii) each provision in each Benefit Plan and Benefit Agreement
         providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any shares of Company
         Common Stock or any Stock Options, Restricted Shares or any other
         interests in respect of any capital stock (including any "phantom"
         stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company shall be deleted
         prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure, that
         following the Effective Time, there shall be no rights to acquire
         shares of Company Common Stock, Stock Options, Restricted Shares or any
         other interests in respect of any capital stock (including any
         "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company or the
         Surviving Corporation;

                  (iii) each Restricted Share outstanding at the Effective Time
         shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an
         amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration (each Restricted
         Share, as so converted, a "Restricted Share Cash Amount"), the payments
         of which shall be subject to, and such amounts shall be payable to the
         holder of such Restricted Share (each, an "RS Holder") in accordance
         with, Section 5.04(c) hereof; and

                  (iv) except as expressly required pursuant to this Section
         5.04, take such action as necessary under the Company Stock Plans to
         ensure that all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting,
         all forfeiture restrictions, all repurchase rights with respect to the
         Restricted Shares, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations
         shall not have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof, shall
         remain in full force and effect with respect to the corresponding
         Restricted Share Cash Amounts after giving effect to the Merger,
         subject to the terms of the grant of such Restricted Shares as in
         effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                (b) The Company shall take any actions with respect to the ESPP
as are necessary to provide that (i) participation in the ESPP shall be limited
to those employees who were participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
such participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (iii)
participants' accumulated payroll deductions outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time under the then-current offering period in effect under the ESPP
(each, an "ESPP Offering Period") shall be used to purchase Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and participants shall have no


                                       59
<PAGE>

further rights under such Offering Period, (iv) there shall not be any
additional "Grant Dates" (as defined in the ESPP) commencing following the date
of this Agreement under the ESPP and (v) the ESPP be suspended following the
close of the current ESPP Offering Period and shall terminate, effective upon
the last business day before the Effective Time (but after the purchases
described in clause (iii) above).

                  (c) Subject to the Offer Letters, each RS Holder shall be
entitled to receive from Parent such RS Holder's Applicable RS Portion (as
defined below) after each Lapse Date (as defined below); provided that if the RS
Holder is not employed by Parent or any of its affiliates on a Lapse Date (other
than any termination of employment that results in the occurrence of a Lapse
Date pursuant to such terms and conditions as were applicable to such Restricted
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time), the RS Holder shall not be
entitled to receive the Applicable RS Portion for such Lapse Date and any
subsequent Lapse Date. For purposes hereof, (i) "Applicable RS Portion" means,
in respect of each RS Holder, an amount equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of Restricted Shares held by such RS Holder at the
Effective Time that would have vested or with respect to which the Company's
right to repurchase would have lapsed on the applicable Lapse Date, and (ii)
"Lapse Date" means, in respect of any Restricted Shares, each date on which such
shares would have vested or the Company's right to repurchase such shares would
have lapsed pursuant to such terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, giving effect to the
acceleration in vesting of such Restricted Shares that will take place pursuant
to Section 16(b) of the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan as a result of the change in
control of the Company at the Effective Time.

                  SECTION 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a)
Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of organization or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

                  (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties
and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.05.

                  (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering each person currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy for


                                       60
<PAGE>

acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms that are no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which insurance shall, prior to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid
for such six year period; provided, that in no event shall Parent be required to
pay, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective Time,
premiums for insurance under this Section 5.05(c) which in the aggregate exceed
300% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company for the period from March 18,
2006, to, and including, March 18, 2007, for such purpose (which premiums for
such period are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $640,500);
provided that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage,
with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective Time, as may
be obtained for such 300% amount. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 5.05(c) shall require Parent to make expenditures exceeding $1,921,500
in the aggregate.

                  (d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

                  SECTION 5.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as expressly set
forth in the last sentence of Section 5.01(a) or this Section 5.06, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

                  (b) In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal has become known
to the Company or any person has publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a
Takeover Proposal otherwise becomes known to the stockholders of the Company and
thereafter (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) (provided in the case of
termination pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), that such Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly announced or disclosed or otherwise become known to the
stockholders of the Company or any person shall have publicly announced the
intention to make a Takeover Proposal (whether or not conditional and whether or
not withdrawn)), and (B) prior to the date that is 12 months after such
termination, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition
Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any Takeover Proposal is
consummated (solely for purposes of this Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), the term
"Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of
Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to 15%
shall be deemed references to 40%) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(d) then the Company shall pay Parent
a fee equal to $23,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day
funds to an account designated by Parent (A) in the case of a termination by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(d), within two business days after
such termination and (B) in the case of a payment as a


                                       61
<PAGE>

result of any event referred to in Section 5.06(b)(i)(B), no later than the
first to occur of such events.

                  (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 5.06, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts
set forth in this Section 5.06, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06 at the prime rate of
Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

                  SECTION 5.07. Public Announcements. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.
Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to
the extent at all reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making,
and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system.

                  SECTION 5.08. Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Sub to comply
with all of Sub's obligations under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.09. Company Rights Agreement. The Board of Directors
of the Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to
in Section 3.01(t)) requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Except as provided
above with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
amend, modify, take any action with respect to, or make any determination under,
the Company Rights Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.10. Certain Pre-Closing Actions. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall take all actions set forth on Section 5.10 of the
Company Letter.

Company, Parent or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in

                  SECTION 7.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated,

from the terminating party to the non-terminating party specifying the
subsection of this Section 7.01 pursuant to which such termination is effected:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and the Company;

         shall not have breached any of its representations, warranties,
         covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
         would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth, in the case
         where such other party is Parent, in Section 6.03(a) or (b), or, in the
         case where such other party is the Company, in Section 6.02(a) or (b));

         Approval shall not have been obtained thereat;

                  (c) by Parent in the event the Board of Directors of the
Company (or a committee thereof) has delivered an Adverse Recommendation Change
Notice or an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred;

                  (d) by Parent in the event the Board of Directors of the
Company fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the approval of this
Agreement within ten business days of the Company's receipt of a written request
by Parent for such reaffirmation, which written request will not be made by
Parent more than twice unless a Takeover Proposal has been made known to the
Company or its stockholders or any person has publicly announced an intention

not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover Proposal otherwise
becomes known to the stockholders of the Company;


                  (e) by Parent if (i) any event shall have occurred which is
not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date and would result in any
condition set forth in Section 6.02 not being satisfied prior to the Termination
Date, (ii) the Company shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.02(a) or (b) and which breach is capable of being cured by the Company by the
Termination Date, but the Company does not commence to cure such breach within
10 business days after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent and
diligently pursue such cure thereafter or (iii) any Legal Restraint having any
of the effects referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 6.02(c) shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.01(e) if any breach of this Agreement by Parent shall have been a
principal cause of the failure of such condition to be satisfied; or

                  (f) by the Company, if (i) any event shall have occurred which
is not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date and would result in
any condition set forth in Section 6.03 not being satisfied prior to the
Termination Date (but only after taking into account any ability of Parent or
Sub to cure any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement herein prior to the Termination Date) or (ii) Parent or Sub shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or (b) and which breach is capable of
being cured by Parent or Sub by the Termination Date, but Parent or Sub, as
applicable, does not commence to cure such breach within 10 business days after
its receipt of written notice thereof from the Company and diligently pursue
such cure thereafter; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(f) if any breach of
this Agreement by the Company shall have been a principal cause of the failure
of such condition to be satisfied.

                  SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either or both of the Company and Parent as
provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the
Company except under the last sentence of Section 5.01(a), the last sentence of
Section 5.02(a), Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII and except for
any willful or intentional material breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement
(which willful or intentional material breach and liability therefor shall not
be affected by termination of this Agreement or any payment of the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(b)).

                  SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval has
been obtained; provided, however, that after the Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval
by stockholders


                                       66
<PAGE>

of the parties without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.

                  SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after the
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by
Law requires further approval by stockholders of the parties without the further
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party which sets forth the substance of such extension
or waiver. The failure or delay by any party to this Agreement to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this
Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                  SECTION 9.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except for the

not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto (and their
respective successors and assigns) any rights (legal, equitable or otherwise)
or remedies, whether as third party beneficiaries or otherwise.

                  SECTION 8.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles

Articles of Merger.

                  SECTION 8.08. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 8.09. Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process;

exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and, if such federal court does not have or declines

the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees that no such
action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or
any of its subsidiaries except in such courts). In the event of an action filed
in any New York State court sitting in the County of New York, each party
commits to designate such action as appropriate for assignment to the Commercial
Division. Each of the parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document
by U.S. registered mail to such person's respective address set forth above
shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New
York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as
set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or
claim), any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in (a) any New York State court sitting in the
County of New York or (b) the United States District Court for the Southern

such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                  SECTION 8.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly
or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not,
in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver
and certifications in this Section 8.10.

                  SECTION 8.11. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
applicable court referenced in Section 8.09, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

                  SECTION 8.12. Consents and Approvals. For any matter under
this Agreement requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and
binding on the parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and
executed and delivered to the other parties by a person duly authorized by such
party to do so.

                  SECTION 8.13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement
or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof.
