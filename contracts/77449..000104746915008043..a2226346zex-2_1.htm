AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 26, 2015, by and among Bridgestone Retail Operations, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), TAJ Acquisition Co., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and The Pep Boys  Manny, Moe and Jack, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are each referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." 

  

    
W I T N E S S E T H: 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $1.00 per share (the "Company Capital Stock" and each share of Company Capital Stock, a "Share"), at a price per Share of $15.00 (such amount or any greater amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable Tax withholding; 

  

 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company as the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 and the Pennsylvania Entity Transactions Law (collectively, the "PBCL"), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding Share, other than (a) Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and (b) Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the Merger Consideration; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (a) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (b) approved the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and adopted this Agreement, and (c) recommended that the shareholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and if required to consummate the Merger, that the shareholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of managers of Parent and the board of directors of Merger Sub have each approved and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and, following execution of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

THE OFFER 

  

 Section 1.1 _ The Offer._ 

  

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Article X_ and provided further that the Company is prepared (in accordance with _Section 1.2_) to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Merger Sub commences the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in any event not later than 15 Business Days from the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. 

  

 (b) The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) prior     

  

to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of Shares which, together
with the Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any),
represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares as of immediately
prior to the Expiration Time (the "Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth on _Exhibit A_ (together with the Minimum Condition,
the "Offer Conditions"). For purposes of determining whether the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied, any Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures shall be included only if such Shares have
been delivered pursuant to such procedures. Subject to the prior satisfaction
of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger
Sub, of the other Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time, Merger Sub
shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in
accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly
as practicable after the Expiration Time. The conditions to the Offer set
forth on _Exhibit A_ are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the
circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub,
_provided_ that nothing therein shall relieve any Party from any obligation or
liability such Party has under this Agreement) giving rise to such condition
or may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time, subject to this _Section 1.1_.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in
cash, without interest, less any applicable Tax withholding.

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub reserve the right (in their sole discretion) to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not on Merger Sub\'s behalf, (i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to any shareholders of the Company, (v) except as otherwise provided in this _Section 1.1_, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, or (vi) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to any shareholders of the Company. 

  

 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless the Offer is extended in accordance with this Agreement or the Parties shall otherwise agree, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the later of (i) January 4, 2016 and (ii) the date that is 20 business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (such time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with this Agreement, the "Expiration Time"). 

  

 (e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article X_, (i) Merger Sub may, and at the request of the Company shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), extend the Offer on one or more occasions for periods of up to 20 Business Days per extension (with the length of any such extension to be determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its sole discretion) up to and including the Termination Date, if at any then-scheduled Expiration Time any Offer Condition has not been satisfied or waived and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period or periods if required by any Law applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Merger Sub be required to, nor shall Parent be required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. 

  

      

  

 (f) Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period or one or more extensions thereof (a "Subsequent Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act if, as of the commencement of such period, there shall not have been validly tendered (without regard to Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee), and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, that number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of shareholders of the Company in accordance with Section 321(d)(1)(ii) of the PBCL. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.1_ shall affect any termination rights in _Article X_. 

  

 (g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions prior to the Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) promptly after the date of the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this _Section 1.1_), accept for payment all Shares that have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (such acceptance for payment of Shares following the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing"), which acceptance shall be by written notice to the Paying Agent, (ii) on the date of the Offer Closing, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price for such accepted Shares and (iii) cause the Paying Agent to pay the Offer Price (subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section 3.6_) for all Shares so accepted as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (h) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article X_. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article X_, prior to the acceptance for payment of the Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event within three Business Days) return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. 

  

 (i) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish in writing to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that may be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in 

  

      

  

each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to
the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments.

  

  

 Section 1.2 _ Company Actions._ 

  

  

 (a) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 8.3_, contain the Company Recommendation. The Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 a copy of the fairness opinion described in _Section 5.23_, together with a summary thereof and of the underlying financial analysis. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9. 

  

 (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub or their agents mailing labels, security position listings, nonobjecting beneficial owner lists and any other available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such information and assistance (including updated lists of record holders or beneficial owners of the Shares, from time to time upon Parent\'s, Merger Sub\'s or either of their respective agents\' reasonable request, and the addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record holders or beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer and providing the Offer Documents to the record holders and beneficial 

  

      

  

owners of the Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up
Option and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Transactions"), Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause their agents and Representatives to deliver)
to the Company or shall destroy all copies and any extract or summaries of
such information then in their possession or control as required by the
Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its Representatives to cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject
to any Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender
such Shares in the Offer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
applicable Company Benefit Plan.

 (a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this _Section 1.3_) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including either by promptly increasing the number of directors (including by amending the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") if necessary to increase the size of the Company Board) or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (x) each committee of the Company Board and (y) as requested by Parent, each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board. 

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the appointment of Parent\'s designees, including mailing to its shareholders information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder require in order to fulfill its obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_, which, unless Parent otherwise elects, shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Company\'s obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject to the receipt of such information. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, (iii) any amendment to the Company\'s Organizational Documents, (iv) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action 

  

      

  

hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, and (v) any waiver of compliance with, or
enforcement by the Company of, any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of the Company.

  

  

 Section 1.4 _ Top-Up Option._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 1.4_, to purchase, at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer, that number of newly issued Shares (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one Share more than 80% of the Fully Diluted Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable to the extent the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the Company\'s authorized and unissued Shares and Shares held in the treasury at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (assuming all Fully Diluted Shares were issued and outstanding). Upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part, at any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice, specifying (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (after giving effect to the Offer Closing) and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, promptly following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parent\'s election, either (i) entirely in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by issuing to the Company an unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option. Such promissory note (i) shall bear interest at the applicable short-term federal rate per annum for U.S. income tax purposes (as periodically set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service "IRS"), payable in arrears at maturity, (ii) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution of the promissory note, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other material terms. The Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a Certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number of Uncertificated Shares. Such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares may include any legends that are required by federal or state securities Laws. The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the issuance and purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that Merger Sub delivers to the Company its notice of exercise of the Top-Up Option and, in any event, as promptly thereafter as possible. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act and that all such Shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act). Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the 

  

      

  

Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

   

 (d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the payment by Merger Sub to the Company of consideration for the Top-Up Shares, will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Subchapter 15D of the PBCL as contemplated by _Section 2.6(a)_. 

  

 (e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 1.4(e)_ will be null and void. 

  

  

 Section 1.5 _ Adjustments._ Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur (other than the issuance of (a) Top-Up Shares, (b) Shares in connection with the exercise or settlement of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Performance Stock Units outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or (c) Shares under the Company ESPP), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) and any other amounts payable in respect of Shares or other securities pursuant to this Agreement, as well as the number of and the purchase price for Top-Up Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change. Nothing in this _Section 1.5_ shall be construed as permitting the Company to take or effect any such reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, combination, exchange or readjustment, stock dividend or distribution, or to enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

On the date of such filing (the "Closing Date"), a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., Philadelphia time, at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 1701 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA (or such other place or time as the Parties may agree). 

        

 Section 2.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of Section 336 of the PBCL. 

   

 Section 2.4 _ Conversion of Company Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

  

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding Share at the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Shares or of any Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article III_, without interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Each Share (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) that is owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) All Shares cancelled and converted pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any Shares (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of an uncertificated Share represented by book entry (each such Share, an "Uncertificated Share") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article III_. 

  

  

 Section 2.5 _ Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.6 _ Dissenters\' Rights._ 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised dissenters\' rights (if applicable) with respect to such Shares in accordance with Subchapter 15D of the PBCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s dissenters\' rights under the PBCL with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Subchapter 15D of the PBCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder\'s dissenters\' rights pursuant to Subchapter 15D of the PBCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Subchapter 15D of the PBCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Articles II_ and _III_ , without interest thereon. If any demand for fair value is made of Dissenting Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the Effective Time, then for purposes of determining the fair value of any Dissenting Shares, the cash received or value of the 

  

      

  

promissory note issued to the Company pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_, as
applicable, in payment of the exercise price of the Top-Up Option shall
be treated as if it had not been paid to or received by the Company and the
Top-Up Shares issued shall be treated as if they were not issued or
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
2.4(a)_, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned prior to the Effective Time,
then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such
shareholder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Subchapter 15D of the PBCL shall
cease.

  

 (b) The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the PBCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. 

  

 

    
ARTICLE III 

PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 

  

 Section 3.1 _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a paying agent mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of Shares for payment in accordance with this _Article III_, immediately available funds constituting an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration that may become payable in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_. 

  

 Section 3.2 _ Payment Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than The Depository Trust Company ("DTC")) (a) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to such letter of transmittal. The surrender of any Uncertificated Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agent\'s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or, in the case of DTC, the customary surrender procedures of DTC and the Paying Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered Shares, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable after such proper surrender, cash in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable. 

       

                                    

    

 Section 3.3 _ No Further Ownership Rights._ All cash paid as Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares. 

  

 Section 3.4 _ Failure to Surrender; No Liability._ If any Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration payable to the holder of such Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange) authority, agency, court commission, or other governmental body (each, a "Governmental Entity")), any such Merger Consideration, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 3.5 _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of Shares claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 3.6 _ Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entities charged with the collection of such amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 3.7 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the close of business on the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or such Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 3.8 _ Equity Awards Under Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall become fully vested and exercisable, and shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation or the Company as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (in conjunction with the Surviving Corporation\'s regular payroll process) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if 

  

      

  

any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per Share exercise price
of each such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares such holder
could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had
such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to
the Effective Time, less any applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance
of doubt, no consideration shall be paid with respect to any Company Stock
Option which has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or more than
the Merger Consideration, and all such Company Stock Options shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each holder of
Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except for the right to receive the payment (if any) described in this
_Section 3.8(a)_.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive Shares granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that vests over the passage of time (including any such award that previously became vested, but which was deferred by the holder) (each, a "Company Restricted Stock Unit") shall vest (to the extent not vested) and shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation or the Company as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (in conjunction with the Surviving Corporation\'s regular payroll process) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of units covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit that have not been settled or paid immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable Tax withholding. As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Stock Units shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the payment described in this _Section 3.8(b)_. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award representing the right to receive Shares granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that vests based on the level of achievement of performance goals (each, a "Company Performance Stock Unit") shall vest as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the applicable performance period (to the extent not vested) and shall be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation or the Company as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (in conjunction with the Surviving Corporation\'s regular payroll process) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of vested units covered by such Company Performance Stock Unit, as determined pursuant to this _Section 3.8(c) _, that have not been settled or paid immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable Tax withholding. As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Performance Stock Units shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the payment described in this _Section 3.8(c)_. 

  

 (d) As soon as administratively practicable following the date of this Agreement, but not later than the day immediately prior to the date on which the first offering period that is regularly scheduled to commence under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to suspend the Company ESPP so that no further offering periods shall commence after the date of this Agreement. With respect to the offering period that is in effect on the date of this Agreement, each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP shall be exercised in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP on the regularly scheduled purchase date for such offering period; _provided_  that if the Closing Date occurs prior to such purchase date, then the purchase right for such offering period shall be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to provide at least ten days\' prior written notice to each participant in the Company ESPP of such purchase. At the Effective Time, all Shares held in the ESPP Brokerage Account, as well as Shares purchased under the last offering period of the Company ESPP, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation or the Company as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time (in conjunction with the 

  

      

  

Surviving Corporation\'s regular payroll process) an amount of cash equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of
Shares purchased under the Company ESPP by such participant.

  

 (e) All notional investments in Shares under the Company Nonqualified Plans (whether vested or unvested), shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder thereof to have allocated to the holder\'s account under the Company Nonqualified Plans an amount denominated in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares deemed invested under or otherwise referenced by such account immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each holder of notional investments in Shares under the Company Nonqualified Plans shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the allocation described in _Section 3.8(e)_. The Company shall provide for the cancellation and conversion of the amounts described in this Section 3.8(e) in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). 

  

 (f) After the date of this Agreement, but prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions with respect to the equity or compensation plans or arrangements as are necessary to (i) give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.8_ and (ii) to ensure that no Person shall have any right under any Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit, Company Performance Stock Unit or any other equity award to acquire or otherwise receive any equity security (or any derivative security relating to any security) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall take such actions in respect of the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence as shall be reasonably requested by Parent between the date of this Agreement and the Closing. All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ shall be made through the Surviving Corporation\'s or the Company\'s payroll systems and the Surviving Corporation or the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from such payments any amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Company and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the equity in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Company. The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP effective as of the Effective Time. The Company shall provide for the cancellation of the Company Restricted Stock Units that previously became vested but which have been deferred by the holder in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

ARTICLE VIII 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

 Section 8.1 _ Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders Meeting._ 

  

  

 (a) Provided there shall not have been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 8.3_, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, if the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders is required under applicable Law, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in such preparation and filing of, a proxy statement or information statement relating to the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement or information statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement"), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the later to occur of (i) the Offer Closing and (ii) the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement and such other information or assistance in the preparation thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Company and (ii) correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC (such date, the "Proxy Clearance Date"). Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Proxy Statement or response, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments. 

  

 (b) Provided there shall not have been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 8.3_, if the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders is required under applicable Law, the Company shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Clearance Date and in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and applicable Law, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") and (ii) (A) use reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company and (B) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any Subsequent Offering Period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries hold, in the aggregate, at least 80% of the Fully Diluted Shares, the Parties will take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub 

  

      

  

of any Shares held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the
Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 321(d)(1)(ii) of the
PBCL. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall affirmatively vote at the Company
Shareholders Meeting or otherwise all Shares acquired in the Offer (if any),
or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries
as of the applicable record date, for the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

 Section 8.2 _ Access to Information._ Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records (including for purposes of observing or conducting physical inventory), officers, and employees and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent consistent with its legal obligations all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent (a) that an agreement is required to be kept confidential in accordance with its terms, (b) it is required by a Governmental Entity or (c) that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, applicable Law requires it or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or information; _provided further_ that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to limit such restrictions and shall furnish information to the extent not so restricted; _provided further_ , however, that (x) to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted in or prohibited from providing any such access pursuant to a Contract for the benefit of any third party under the preceding clause (a), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (without being required to make any payments) to obtain any approval, consent or waiver with respect to such Contract that is necessary to provide such access, and (y) the foregoing shall in no event permit Parent or its Representatives to access information which is the subject matter addressed in _Section 8.3_, which shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions of _Section 8.3_. The Parties will hold any such information in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter agreement dated July 2015, between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

  

 Section 8.3 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 8.3(b)_, from and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any material non-public information with respect to, any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend any Competing Proposal, (v) adopt, enter into, or propose publicly to adopt or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract relating to any Competing Proposal or (vi) terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company or its Subsidiaries may waive, if requested by the applicable counterparty, rights under any standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to the extent necessary to enable such counterparty to make a Competing Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be 

  

      

  

terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to any Competing
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives. Subject to _Section
8.3(b)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (i) withdraw (or change, amend, modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or change,
amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the
Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal, (iii) fail to announce
publicly, within ten Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the Shares (other than the Offer) has been commenced, that the
Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, or (iv)
take any other action or make any other proposal or public statement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any action described in clauses
(i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Change of Recommendation").

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_, if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Closing, the Company receives a Competing Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and which Competing Proposal did not result from a breach of _Section 8.3(a)_, then the Company may, subject to compliance with this _Section 8.3_ in all material respects, (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such Competing Proposal or (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case if, and only if, (x) the Company provides notice to Parent of its intent to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such person in accordance with this _Section 8.3(b)_, (y) the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are determined in good faith by the Company to be no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement ( _it being understood_ that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement) (any such agreement, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), and the Company promptly thereafter (but in any event within 24 hours) provides to Parent a copy of any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (z) the Company provides to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to such Person (or its Representatives) to the extent such information has not previously been provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person (or its Representatives). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board may, if the Company receives a Competing Proposal after the execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of _Section 8.3(a)_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that have been offered in writing by Parent in accordance with this _Section 8.3(c)_, (i) effect a Change of Recommendation or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1(g)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case only if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) unless (A) the Company shall have 

  

      

  

provided prior written notice (a "Company Notice") to Parent, at least three
Business Days in advance of such Change of Recommendation or
such termination, of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which Company
Notice shall specify (1) the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
(3) a copy of the most current version of any proposed definitive
agreement(s) with respect to such Superior Proposal and (B) at or after 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day following the day on
which Parent and Merger Sub receive the Company Notice (it being understood
that for purposes of calculating such three Business Days, the first Business
Day will be the first Business Day after the date of such receipt), the
Company reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor) that (1) such Competing Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to make a Change of
Recommendation as a result thereof would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any change
in the consideration payable with respect thereto or any other material
amendment to the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Company Notice and a new two Business Day period (which two Business
Day period shall be calculated in the same manner as the initial three
Business Day period)). In determining whether to make a Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
10.1(g)_ and this _Section 8.3(c)_, the Company Board will take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement as may be proposed in
writing by Parent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day
of the applicable three Business Day period or two Business Day period, as
applicable, in response to a Company Notice, and if requested by Parent, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
a Company Notice.

  

 (d) The Company will (i) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis of the status and developments (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Competing Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent within 24 hours after receipt or delivery thereof all drafts of agreements relating to any Competing Proposal and any written proposals containing any material terms of a Competing Proposal or a counterproposal to a Competing Proposal, in each case exchanged between any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making any such Competing Proposal or any of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives, on the other hand. No notice or communication made by the Company to Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ will be deemed to be a Company Notice unless such notice or communication complies with the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_. 

  

 (e) As used in this Agreement, 

    

 (i) the term "Competing Proposal" means any written bona fide proposal made by a third party (other than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries) relating to any direct or indirect (A) acquisition, purchase, sale, license, lease, contribution or disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise) to such Person or group of Persons (or Affiliates thereof) of any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries representing or generating 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) issuance, sale or other disposition to such Person or group of Persons (or Affiliates thereof) of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% 

   

      

   

or more of the combined voting power of the Shares, (C) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 15% or more of the combined voting power of the Shares, (D) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in which the other party thereto or its shareholders will own
15% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from
any such transaction or (E) combination of the foregoing, in each case other
than Transactions; and

  

 (ii) the term "Superior Proposal" means a Competing Proposal that the Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company\'s shareholders than the Transactions, after taking into account such factors (including likelihood of termination in light of all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal) as the Company Board considers to be appropriate; _provided_ that, for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "15% or more" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "all or substantially all". 

    

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with any applicable Law; _provided_ that disclosures under this _Section 8.3(f)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves, for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_. 

  

  

 Section 8.4 _ Efforts; Cooperation._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an appropriate filing (or draft if required by the applicable Governmental Entity) pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days of the date hereof and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. 

  

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 8.4(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission, including by promptly supplying the other Party with any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filing or submission, and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, and except as prohibited by applicable Law or the applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other Party with copies of all such written communications, and (iii) permit the other Party to review (and consider in good faith the views and comments of the other Party in connection with) any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or 

  

      

  

conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
except as prohibited by applicable Law or the applicable Governmental Entity,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences. Absent mutual consent, neither Parent nor the
Company shall have the right to determine whether to enter into any agreement
with any applicable Governmental Entity extending additional time for the
review of the Transactions under the HSR Act if such additional time would
extend beyond the Termination Date.

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in _Sections 8.4(a)_ and _8.4(b)_ , if any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violating any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent and the Company shall, subject to _Section 8.4(d)_, use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the Transactions, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, including agreeing to any structural or conduct relief relating to the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries or to litigate. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (i) nothing in this _Section 8.4_ shall limit a Party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries will be required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, products, services, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, products, services, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, (C) pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel) or (D) impose any restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, in order to satisfy the condition set forth in clause (a) of _Exhibit A_, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be required to take the actions set forth in clause (ii) above if, but only if, such actions would not result, in the aggregate, in the loss of net sales revenue (other than revenue from the Company\'s retail and/or commercial automotive parts business) (as measured by the Parties\' and their Affiliates\' fiscal year 2014 net sales revenue with respect thereto) in excess of $75,000,000. To the extent any such action implicates overlapping assets, products, services, businesses or portions of businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, then the calculation of revenue shall be measured by reference to the highest such revenue of Parent or the Company, or their respective Affiliates, for each such overlapping asset, product, service, business or portion of business so implicated, regardless of which asset, product, service, business or portion of business is actually sold, licensed, assigned, transferred, divested, held separate, disposed or otherwise restricted or limited. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties shall in good faith consult with the other Parties with respect to all material antitrust defense decisions; _provided_ that Parent shall control and direct the antitrust defense of the Transactions in any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other Person and in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representations, without the prior written consent of Parent, propose, negotiate or commit or otherwise agree to 

  

      

  

any effect, remedy or relief or to take any action in respect of any
objection or suit challenging the Transactions.

  

  

 Section 8.5 _ Employee Benefit Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving Corporation ("Company Employees") (i) compensation (including, without limitation, base salary and target bonus opportunity, and excluding any equity-based compensation) that is, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the aggregate compensation being provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any equity-based compensation) and (ii) benefits programs that are, in the aggregate, not materially less favorable than the aggregate benefits programs being provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement limits the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to terminate the employment of any Company Employee at any time following the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit plans of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service credit shall result in a duplication of benefits with respect to any service period. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, to the extent permitted under the applicable New Plan, Parent shall cause (A) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents and (B) any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the plan year of the New Plan that includes the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.5_ to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, no Company Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates before the Closing, for any purpose, under any employee benefit plans of Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates that are closed for purposes of participation by new participants.

In addition, the Company shall terminate each of the Company Nonqualified Plans in accordance with the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B) and Parent acknowledges and agrees to such termination of the Company Nonqualified Plans. In connection with the termination of the 

  

      

  

Company Nonqualified Plans, each participant entitled to receive a benefit
under the Company Nonqualified Plans shall receive full payment of the total
value of the amounts credited to their accounts under the Company
Nonqualified Plans in a single lump sum cash payment as soon as
administratively practicable after the Effective Time (in conjunction with the
Surviving Corporation\'s regular payroll process).

  

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 8.5_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties and nothing in this _Section 8.5_, express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or (ii) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement sponsored by either of the Parties. 

   

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of calculations with respect to Section 280G of the Code (whether or not final) with respect to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) in connection with the Transactions. 

  

  

 Section 8.6 _ Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), now existing in favor of the current directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective Organizational Documents or in any written indemnification agreement (accurate and complete copies of which have been provided to Parent and are listed on Section 8.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (including, if necessary, by providing the Surviving Corporation with the necessary financial resources), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, solely to the extent required by: (i) the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws or the equivalent Organizational Documents of any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other applicable Contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 8.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to) obtain a six-year pre-paid "tail policy" covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the current policies of the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company (the "DandO Insurance") with such coverage levels not materially less favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , that (i) such "tail" insurance policies shall not require the payment of an aggregate annual premium in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the DandO Insurance (and if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to (and as of the Effective Time Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii) prior to the Closing, the Company shall not enter into any Contract for a "tail" policy without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably 

  

      

  

withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the current DandO
Insurance with levels of coverage no less favorable than that provided as of
the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts
to purchase comparable policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance for such six year period with levels of coverage no less favorable
as provided under the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement to maintain such insurance (and if the annual premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount).

   

 (c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 8.6_ applies are intended (and shall be) third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.6_. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Sections 11.1_ or _11.10_ to the contrary, this _Section 8.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.6_. 

  

  

 Section 8.7 _ Public Announcements._ Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any Party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or exchange listing requirements to which the relevant Party is subject or submits, wherever situated, or as may be made by the Company in accordance with _Section 8.3_, in which case the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party. 

  

 Section 8.8 _ Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the Company, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 Section 8.9 _ Section 16(b) Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 

        

 Section 8.10 _ Rule 14d-10(d) Matters._ Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each Contract entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 8.11 _ Anti-Takeover Statutes._ If any Anti-Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to any Transaction, then each Party shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Anti-Takeover Statute inapplicable to the Transactions. 

  

 Section 8.12 _ Securityholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any securityholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement will be agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 Section 8.14 _ Company SEC Reports._ From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will timely file with the SEC all Company SEC Reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act and should any error or omission in a previously filed Company SEC Report be identified, the Company will make any required filings or amendments necessary to complete the Proxy Statement and ensure that neither such filings nor the Proxy Statement contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

supplemented, if applicable, filed after the date of this Agreement pursuant
to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective after to the date of this Agreement, will not contain any

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

 Section 8.15 _ Stock Exchange De-listing._ After the Offer Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Capital Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Capital Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten days thereafter.

 (c) by either the Company or Parent if any Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law that is in effect and which has the effect of making the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibiting or preventing the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, and such Law, in each case, shall have become final and nonappealable; 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (d) by the Company, if, prior to the Offer Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their respective obligations hereunder and (ii) has not been or is incapable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, within the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) 30 days after its receipt of written notice thereof from the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to pay any consideration when due hereunder shall not be entitled to a cure period; 

  

 (e) by Parent, if, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in clause (b) or (c) of _Exhibit A_ and (ii) has not been or is incapable of being cured by the Company within the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) 30 days after its receipt of written notice thereof from Parent;

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1_ shall not be available to
any Party (x) that is in material breach of its obligations hereunder or (y)

As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Party\'s advisors, counsel and accountants, incurred by the Party or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, and the out-of-pocket expenses of the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement (if any) and the solicitation of shareholders related to the Transactions. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section 10.1(e)_ and, prior to such termination, a Competing Proposal has been publicly proposed or disclosed, and, in each case, not publicly withdrawn at the time of the termination, (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)(i)_, (iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)(ii)_, or (iv) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(g)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the date of such termination (in the case of clauses (i) through (iii) above) or concurrently with such termination (in the case of clause (iv) above), pay Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds a fee equal to $35,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Termination Fee will be payable by the Company pursuant to clause (i) or (iii) above unless and until within 12 months of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement relating to any Competing Proposal or consummates the transactions contemplated by any Competing Proposal, in which case such Company Termination Fee shall be paid upon the earlier to occur of the Company\'s or its Subsidiary\'s entry into a definitive agreement with respect to the Competing Proposal or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the case of any fraud or Willful Breach, (x) Parent\'s receipt of payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Affiliates for any loss suffered in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination (including any breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or any certificate or other document delivered or entered into pursuant to this Agreement) and (y) thereafter neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members, shareholders, assignees, representatives or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to contrary herein, the provisions of this _Section 10.4(b)_ shall be subject in all respects to _Section 11.11_; _it being understood_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to enforce all of their rights under this Agreement prior to the effectiveness of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, and in no event shall the Company assert Parent\'s entitlement to termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, or the amount of the Company Termination Fee that Parent shall become entitled to receive as a result of such termination, as a basis to oppose any of the remedies as provided in _Section 11.11_. 

  

      

  

 (c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section 10.4(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment.

 (a) Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable harm would occur and that the Parties may not have any adequate remedy at law (i) for any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, each of the Company and Parent shall be entitled to equitable relief (if the court so grants), without proof of actual damages, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and such injunction or injunctions shall be in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties are entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance or actual or threatened breach. 

  

 (b) Any action or proceeding for any such remedy shall be brought exclusively in such courts as specified in _Section 11.7_ and each Party waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy and any defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for such breach or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason of law or equity. Each of the Parties agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 11.11_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has been breached or terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 11.11_ are not available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this _Section 11.11_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party\'s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 11.11_ before exercising any termination right under _Article X_ (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 11.11_ or anything contained in this _Section 11.11_ restrict or limit any Party\'s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article X_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. The Parties further agree that following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article X_, a Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in this _Section 11.11_ to enforce specifically the surviving obligations herein, including to make such payments as may be required under _Section 10.3_ or _Section 10.4(b)_

   

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may pursue a grant of specific performance of the type described in this _Section 11.11_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under _Section 10.4(b)_, but under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Company Termination Fee.
