to the Continuing Employees,  during normal business hours, for purposes of
enrolling the Continuing  Employees in Purchaser\'s Benefit Plans and
Purchaser\'s 401(k) Plan (as  hereinafter defined).   (c) Effective as of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make  available to Continuing Employees of
the US Companies ("US Continuing  -------------  Employees") a defined
contribution plan of Purchaser (the "Purchaser\'s  --------- -----------

contribution may include  promissory notes for loans made to such US

amounts paid under a  corresponding Benefit Plan during the same period for
purposes of  applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as

conditions  of the Purchaser\'s Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing  provisions of this paragraph (d), service and other amounts shall
not  -------------  be credited to US Continuing Employees (or their
eligible dependents)  to the extent the crediting of such service or other
amounts would  result in the duplication of benefits, and Purchaser\'s
Benefit Plans  shall not be required to waive any pre-existing condition
limitation  with respect to any US Continuing Employees (or their eligible 
dependents) if, after taking into account the foregoing provisions of  this
paragraph (d), such pre-existing condition limitation would not 
-------------  be waived for other participants in applicable Purchaser\'s
Benefit  Plans.   (e) After the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that the
Non-US  Companies or Purchaser shall be liable for all benefits payable

other than the US Benefit Plans.   (f) It is understood and agreed that all
provisions contained in  this Agreement with respect to employee benefit
plans or employee  compensation are included for the sole benefit of the

Closing, Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Companies to) indemnify each
MRM Seller and   -35-     their respective Affiliates against, and hold

5.14 Non-Competition. For a period of five (5) years from and after the 
--------------- Closing Date (the "Non-Competition Period"), none of the MRM
Sellers or their  ---------------------- Affiliates (excluding the
Management Stockholders) will, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world,
conduct any business, or own, manage, operate, join, control, finance,
participate in the ownership, management, operation, control or financing of,
or become or be connected with or otherwise become or be interested in or
associated with, any Person which is at such time engaged in competition with
the Business as conducted by the Companies as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that:  -------- -------   (a) the restrictions contained in this
Section 5.14 shall not  ------------  apply to the present operations or
activities of any MRM Seller or any  of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies), including the provision  by any MRM Seller or any of its
Affiliates of incidental fund  administration services as part of its trust
and corporate services  business;   (b) the restrictions contained in this
Section 5.14 shall not  apply to the operations or activities of any Person
not affiliated  with an MRM Seller (an "Acquiring Person") which acquires
Equity  Interests or assets of either MRM Seller or any of their
Affiliates,  or any Affiliate of such Acquiring Person (other than the MRM
Sellers  and their Affiliates prior to such acquisition) and which
immediately  prior to such acquisition is engaged in operations or activities
in  competition with the Business;   (c) any of the MRM Sellers or their
Affiliates may sell or  otherwise provide goods and services to competitors
of the Business,  so long as the sale or provision of such goods and services
in and of  itself does not directly compete with the Business;  
-36-      (d) any of the MRM Sellers or their Affiliates may purchase
fund  administration services, securities services and corporate
secretarial  services from competitors of the Business; and   (e) any of

competitor (or its corporate parent)  do not comprise more than 5% of the
outstanding securities of any  class of such competitor and provided that it
does not have the power  to control or direct the management or affairs of
such competitor. It  is recognized by the MRM Sellers that the Business is or
will be after  the Closing Date conducted throughout the entire world, and
that more  limited geographical limitations on this non-competition covenant
are  therefore not appropriate.  Each MRM Seller represents and warrants to
Purchaser that the present operations or activities of any MRM Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Companies) that overlap with that of the
Business are only incidental to the other businesses of any MRM Seller or any
of its Affiliates.   5.15 Use of Hemisphere Name.

of any Person, other than Purchaser or its  Affiliates, relating to the
possible acquisition of any of the  Companies, whether by way of merger or

otherwise, or of any portion of the  capital stock or assets (excluding sales

----------- ---------------  provided, that in the event of a breach by any
Seller in the  --------  performance of its obligation to consummate the
sale of any Shares to  Purchaser in accordance with, and subject to, the

any other right to indemnification, contribution or recovery  from any Seller
or any of their respective Affiliates (whether under  this Agreement or under
any common law or any statute, including any  environmental Law, or

employees.   10.5 Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after
becoming aware  ------ of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
not involving a claim, or the   -50-     commencement of any suit,
action or proceeding, of the type described in Section  ------- 10.6, but in
any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after first
becoming ---- aware of such claim, the Indemnified Person shall give notice
to the Indemnifying Person of such claim, which notice shall specify the
facts alleged to constitute the basis for such claim, the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations alleged to have been breached and a
good faith estimate of the amount that the Indemnified Person seeks hereunder
from the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to
request and receive from the Indemnified Person such other information that
is reasonably available to the Indemnified Person as may be necessary for the
Indemnifying Person to determine that the limitations in Section 10.4 have
been satisfied or  ------------ do not apply with respect to such claim;
provided, that the failure of the  -------- Indemnified Person to give such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under
this Article X except to the extent (if any) that the 
--------- Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby.   10.6
Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified 
--------------------------------------------------- Person shall give notice
as promptly as is reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days after receiving notice thereof, to the Indemnifying Person
of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature and amount of such claim. The Indemnifying Person shall
have the right to request and receive from the Indemnified Person such other
information that is reasonably available to the Indemnified Person as may be
necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that the limitations in
Section 10.4 have been satisfied or do not apply; provided, that the failure 
------------ -------- of the Indemnified Person to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this Article X
except to the extent (if any)  --------- that the Indemnifying Person shall
have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own
expense, (a) participate in the defense of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified Person, at any time during
the course of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense
thereof with counsel of its own choice and in the event of such assumption,
shall have the exclusive right, subject to clause (i) of Section 10.7, to
settle or compromise such claim, suit, action or ----------
------------ proceeding; provided, that the Indemnifying Person shall not
have the right to  -------- assume the defense of any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding if at such time, it is reasonably foreseeable that such
claim, suit, action or proceeding would result in damages in excess of $7.5
million of the amount which would be indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Person
under this Agreement with respect to such claim, suit, action or proceeding.
If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to
defend or prosecute any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, all of the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.  
10.7 Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or caused 
------------------------ to be made by the Indemnified Person (unless the
Indemnifying Person has the   -51-    exclusive right to settle or
compromise under clause (b) of Section 10.6) or the  ----------
------------- Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any such claim,
suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in Section 10.6 shall also
be binding upon  ------------ the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or
decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of
such settlement or compromise; provided,  -------- that (i) no obligation,
restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of
such settlement or compromise without its prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the Indemnified Person
will not compromise or settle any claim, suit, action or proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.   10.8 Time Limits. If any claim for
indemnification or other recovery is  ----------- timely asserted under this
Article X, the Indemnified Person shall have the  --------- right to bring
an action, suit or proceeding with respect to such claim within two (2) years
after the earlier of (a) becoming aware of a claim for indemnification or (b)
receiving notice thereof, as the case may be, but may not bring any such
action, suit or proceeding thereafter.   10.9 Net Losses and Subrogation. 
--------------------------   (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary,  the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any
Indemnified  Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any
insurance  proceeds received by the Indemnified Person (or any of its
Affiliates)  with respect to such Losses, and (ii) any recoveries obtained by
the  Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third 
party. Each Indemnified Person shall exercise commercially reasonable 
efforts to obtain such proceeds and recoveries. If any such proceeds  or
recoveries are received by an Indemnified Person (or any of its  Affiliates)
with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Person  has made a payment
to the Indemnified Person with respect thereto, the  Indemnified Person (or
such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying  Person the amount of such
proceeds or recoveries (up to the amount of  the Indemnifying Person\'s
payment).   (b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person in
respect  of any Losses, the Indemnifying Person will, to the extent of such 
payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Person (and  its
Affiliates) against any third party in respect of the Losses to  which such
payment relates to the extent of such payment. Such  Indemnified Person (and
its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Person will  execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence  or further perfect such
subrogation rights.   10.10 Purchase Price Adjustments. To the extent
permitted by Law, any  -------------------------- amounts payable under
Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 shall be treated by Purchaser  ------------
------------ and Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.  
-52-      10.11 Role of Seller Representative. Purchaser shall be
entitled to deal  ----------------------------- with and rely on the Seller
Representative on all matters involving Sellers in connection with this
Article X.  ---------   ARTICLE XI   MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 Expenses.
Each party hereto shall bear its own fees and expenses with 
-------- respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, provided, that
Purchaser shall  -------- pay all sales, use, value added, stamp, transfer,
service, recording and like taxes and fees imposed by any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transfer and assignment of the Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to fees and expenses incurred by
MRM Sellers on behalf of themselves and the Management Stockholders, and by
the Management Stockholders on their own behalf, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Related Agreement, the
Management Escrow Agreement and the Agreement and Release, (a) the MRM
Sellers shall pay for the fees of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, and
(b) the MRM Sellers shall bear 86.8%, and the Management Stockholders shall
bear 13.2%, of all other expenses incurred by the MRM Sellers (including any
expenses (but not fees) to be paid to Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation)
and the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel incurred by the
Management Stockholders (the "Shared Expenses").  ---------------   11.2
Amendment. Except as provided in Section 11.15, this Agreement may be 
--------- ------------- amended, modified or supplemented but only in writing
signed by Purchaser and the Seller Representative; provided that no such
amendment, modification or  -------- waiver shall disproportionately affect
the Management Stockholders or any one or portion of them without the consent
of the Management Stockholder Representative (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment, modification or waiver that would cause the Management
Stockholders to bear more than 13.2% of any decrease in the Purchase Price
shall be deemed to have a disproportionate effect on the Management
Stockholders for purposes of this Section 11.2).  ------------   11.3
Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be 
------- given hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be
