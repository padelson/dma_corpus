AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of October 3, 2018 by and among Cloudera, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Cloudera"), Surf Merger Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Cloudera ("Merger Sub"),
and Hortonworks, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Hortonworks"). All capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in Annex A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Cloudera, Merger Sub
and Hortonworks have approved the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and deems it advisable and in the best interest of their stockholders
to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into Hortonworks (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Hortonworks
will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cloudera and each share of Hortonworks Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined herein) will be canceled
and converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth herein,
all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement will be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Cloudera and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Hortonworks
(together with certain of their respective affiliates), in their respective
capacities as stockholders of Hortonworks, have entered into support
agreements with Cloudera substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (each, a "Hortonworks Support Agreement" and collectively, the "Hortonworks
Support Agreements").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Hortonworks to enter into this
Agreement, each of the officers and directors of Cloudera (together with
certain of their respective affiliates), in their respective capacities as
stockholders of Cloudera, have entered into support agreements with
Hortonworks substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a
"Cloudera Support Agreement" and collectively, the "Cloudera Support
Agreements").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Cloudera, Merger Sub and Hortonworks hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into 

Hortonworks, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease and Hortonworks shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cloudera. Hortonworks, as the
surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation." Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Cloudera, Merger Sub and
Hortonworks shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the DGCL by filing
a certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the "Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware
Secretary of State") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
The time of such filing and acceptance by the Delaware Secretary of State, or
such later time as may be agreed in writing by Cloudera and Hortonworks and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, is referred to herein as the
"Effective Time."

1.2 The Surviving Corporation of the Merger.

(a) Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

(i) Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the terms of Section 7.8(b),
effective at the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Hortonworks shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read identically to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated
Certificate of Incorporation shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation;
provided, however, that at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "Hortonworks, Inc."

(ii) Bylaws. Subject to the terms of Section 7.8(b), Cloudera and Hortonworks
shall take such actions reasonably necessary to cause the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, to become the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
such Bylaws.

(b) Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(i) Directors. Unless otherwise determined by Cloudera and Hortonworks prior
to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(ii) Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Cloudera and Hortonworks prior
to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

1.3 General Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Hortonworks and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Hortonworks and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.4 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations.

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Capital Stock of Hortonworks.

(i) Generally. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Cloudera, Merger Sub, Hortonworks, or the holders of any
of the following securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this Section
1.4(b), each share of Hortonworks Common Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive 1.305 shares of Cloudera
Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio") and the cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i) (the "Common Stock Consideration")
upon the surrender of such share of Hortonworks Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit of loss and indemnity in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(e)); provided, however, that (x) the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Cloudera Common Stock or
Hortonworks Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other like change with respect to Cloudera Common Stock or Hortonworks
Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, and (y) notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth herein, no fraction of a share of Cloudera Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, and in lieu thereof, each holder of
record of shares of Hortonworks Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Hortonworks Common Stock pursuant to this Section
1.4(b)(i) (after aggregating all fractional shares of Cloudera Common Stock
that otherwise would be received by such holder of record) shall, upon the
surrender of such share of Hortonworks Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.3(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit of loss and indemnity in the manner provided in
Section 2.3(e)), receive an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying such
fraction by the Closing Average. From and after the Effective Time, all shares
of Hortonworks Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of
shares of Hortonworks Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Cloudera Common Stock
issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i), cash in lieu
of any fractional shares payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Section
1.4(b)(i) and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.3(d). All shares of Cloudera Common Stock issued upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Hortonworks Common Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to
this Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of a fractional share of Cloudera Common Stock
and any dividends or other distributions paid in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.3(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Hortonworks Common Stock, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Hortonworks Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
certificate representing shares of Hortonworks Common Stock is presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such certificate shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Common Stock Consideration in accordance with
this Section 1.4(b), any cash payable in respect thereof pursuant to



this Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of a fractional share of Cloudera Common Stock
and any dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.3(d).

(ii) Owned Shares of Hortonworks Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Cloudera, Merger Sub, Hortonworks, or the
holders of any of the following securities, each share of Hortonworks Common
Stock that is owned by Cloudera, Merger Sub or Hortonworks, or by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Cloudera, Merger Sub or Hortonworks, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Restricted Shares of Hortonworks Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, if any shares of Hortonworks Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or subject to
a repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
Hortonworks or under which Hortonworks has any rights (the "Hortonworks
Restricted Stock"), then the Common Stock Consideration payable in exchange
for such Hortonworks Restricted Stock also shall be unvested and subject to
the same repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other
condition. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Hortonworks Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) and the Cloudera Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) shall adopt any corporate resolutions that may be
reasonably necessary to provide that, from and after the Effective Time,
Cloudera is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

(c) Stock Awards of Hortonworks.

(i) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Hortonworks Stock Award that is
a stock option to purchase shares of Hortonworks Common Stock (each a
"Hortonworks Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable (each, an "Assumed
Option"), shall be assumed by Cloudera and converted into an option to acquire
that number of shares of Cloudera Common Stock equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Hortonworks Common Stock subject to
such Hortonworks Stock Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share of Cloudera Common Stock. Each Assumed Option shall
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting
and exercisability) as were applicable under the respective Hortonworks Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Assumed
Option shall have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of Hortonworks Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio (which price per
share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of
the parties that each Assumed Option that qualified as a United States-based
incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue
to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Stock Option is subject to the Legal
Requirements of a non-U.S. jurisdiction and Cloudera determines (in good faith
and upon advice from Cloudera's legal counsel) the Stock Option may not be
converted into an Assumed Option under a Legal Requirement of the relevant
non-U.S. jurisdiction (including without limitation by reason of a failure to
obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain such consents or approvals) (such Stock Options,
the "Unassumed Options"), Cloudera shall: (A), if necessary to ensure
compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, require that outstanding
Unassumed Options be accelerated and exercised only by a cashless exercise
pursuant to which employees will authorize a broker to sell all shares that
they are entitled to at exercise immediately upon exercise and receive the
difference between the



fair market value of the shares at exercise and the exercise price in cash;
(B) provide for conversion of the Unassumed Options into the right to receive,
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Closing Average over the
applicable exercise price of such Unassumed Option by (y) the number of
Hortonworks shares subject to such Unassumed Option, less all applicable
deductions and withholdings required by applicable Legal Requirements to be
withheld in respect of such payment; or (C) provide for such other treatment
that is in compliance with applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably agreed
upon by Cloudera and Hortonworks at least twenty (20) days prior to the
Effective Time.

(ii) Restricted Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each Hortonworks
Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested (each, an "Assumed Unit"), shall be assumed
by Cloudera; provided, however, that each Assumed Unit shall be converted into
an award to receive that number of shares of Cloudera Common Stock equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Hortonworks
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Cloudera Common Stock. Each Assumed Unit shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and issuance) as were
applicable under the respective Hortonworks Restricted Stock Unit immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Assumed Unit
that was granted with a purchase price other than par value shall have a
purchase price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
per share purchase price of Hortonworks Common Stock subject to such Assumed
Unit by (y) the Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Hortonworks
Restricted Stock Unit is subject to the Legal Requirements of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction and Cloudera determines (in good faith and upon advice from
Cloudera's legal counsel) the Restricted Stock Unit may not be converted into
an Assumed Unit under a Legal Requirement of the relevant non-U.S.
jurisdiction (including without limitation by reason of a failure to obtain
any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain such consents or approvals), Cloudera shall
provide for such other treatment that is in compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements and reasonably agreed upon by Cloudera and Hortonworks at least
twenty (20) days prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) Performance Stock Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the Hortonworks
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) will adopt resolutions and take
all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that each award of
Hortonworks Performance Stock Units shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive, immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the occurrence
of the Closing, the number of shares of Hortonworks Common Stock that are
earned thereunder shall be determined based on the greater of target
performance or actual performance (measured through the Effective Time). Any
shares of Hortonworks Common Stock so delivered in respect of Hortonworks
Performance Stock Units shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and treated in accordance with Section
1.4(b).

(iv) Registration Statements for Assumed Options and Other Awards. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than two (2)
business days following the Effective Time, Cloudera shall file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or another
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of Cloudera Common Stock issuable with
respect to the Assumed Options and Assumed Units, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so
long as such Assumed Options or Assumed Units remain outstanding.



1.5 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Hortonworks and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of Hortonworks and
Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary
action.

1.6 Tax Reorganization. The parties hereto intend, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is hereby
adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g).

ARTICLE II 
THE CLOSING

2.3 Issuance of Merger Consideration After the Closing.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Cloudera shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Hortonworks to act as the exchange
agent for the Merger pursuant to an exchange agent agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Hortonworks (the "Exchange Agent").

(b) Exchange Fund.

(i) Creation of Exchange Fund. As promptly as practicable (and in any event
within one (1) business day) following the Effective Time, Cloudera shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, the shares of Cloudera Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i)
in exchange for shares of Hortonworks Common Stock. In addition, Cloudera
shall make available from time to time after the Effective Time as necessary,
cash in an amount sufficient to pay any cash payable pursuant to Section
1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional shares of Cloudera Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Hortonworks Common
Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(d). Any Cloudera Common Stock
and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "Exchange Fund."

(ii) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of Cloudera or the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to Cloudera or the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise according to the instruction of Cloudera or the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such
Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.3 shall after such delivery to
Cloudera and the Surviving Corporation look only to Cloudera and the Surviving
Corporation for delivery or payment of the shares of Cloudera Common Stock
issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), cash payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of any fractional shares
of Cloudera Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d).

(c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time (and in any event, within five (5) business days thereafter), Cloudera
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the
"Certificates") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Hortonworks Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form as Hortonworks and Cloudera may reasonably agree (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for whole
shares of Cloudera Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), cash payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of any fractional shares
of Cloudera Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d). Upon surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Cloudera, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the number of whole shares
of Cloudera Common Stock (after taking into account all



Certificates or such Book Entry Shares surrendered by such holder of record)
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) (which shall
be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested by the holder of record or is otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements), payment of any cash such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional shares of Cloudera Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.3(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose for
an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates on the cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.3. Until so surrendered, from and
after the Effective Time outstanding Certificates shall be deemed to evidence
only the ownership of the number of full shares of Cloudera Common Stock into
which such shares of Hortonworks Common Stock shall have been so converted and
the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.4(b)(i) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d). Any holder of non-
certificated shares of Hortonworks Common Stock represented by book entry
("Book Entry Shares") shall not be required to deliver an executed letter of
transmittal in order to receive the shares of Cloudera Common Stock issuable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), cash payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of any fractional shares of
Cloudera Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(d). In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book
Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Cloudera shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event, no later than five (5)
business days thereafter), such consideration in accordance with the customary
procedures of Cloudera's transfer agent, the Exchange Agent and any depository
for such Book Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, shares of Cloudera Common Stock to be received in conjunction with
the Merger by any Person constituting an "affiliate" of Hortonworks for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act shall be subject to the
restrictions described in such Rule 145.

(d) Dividends and Distributions. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Cloudera Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a
dividend or other distribution in respect of all shares of Cloudera Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Cloudera Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Cloudera Common Stock
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements,
following surrender of any Certificates or Book Entry Shares in the manner
provided in Section 2.3(c), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record
holders thereof, without interest, promptly after such surrender, the number
of whole shares of Cloudera Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along
with any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Cloudera Common Stock.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the shares of Cloudera Common
Stock issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i), the cash
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i) in lieu of fractional
shares of Cloudera Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.3(d); provided, however, that Cloudera
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
customary indemnity against any claim that may be made against Cloudera, the



Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) Transferred Shares. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of
Hortonworks Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of Hortonworks, or if shares of Cloudera Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificates so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has
paid to Cloudera (or any agent designated by Cloudera) any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Cloudera Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Cloudera (or any agent
designated by Cloudera) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid or
are otherwise not payable.

(g) Tax Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Cloudera and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Hortonworks Capital Stock, such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non
U.S. tax law or under any applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

(h) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Cloudera, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Cloudera
Common Stock or Hortonworks Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirement.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HORTONWORKS

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure letter that has been prepared by
Hortonworks and delivered by Hortonworks to Cloudera in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Hortonworks Disclosure Letter"), which expressly identifies the Section (or,
if applicable, subsection) to which such exception relates (it being
understood and hereby agreed that any disclosure in the Hortonworks Disclosure
Letter relating to one Section or subsection shall also apply to any other
Sections and subsections if and to the extent that it is readily apparent on
the face of such disclosure (without reference to the underlying documents
referenced therein) that such disclosure also relates to such other Sections
or subsections), or (ii) as set forth in any Hortonworks SEC Reports filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC and publicly available on or after January 1,
2018 and prior to the date hereof (other than in any "risk factors" or other
disclosure statements included therein that are cautionary, predictive or
forward looking in nature and not statements of historical fact), Hortonworks
hereby represents and warrants to Cloudera and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. Hortonworks is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to enable it to own,
lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to
conduct its business as it is currently conducted. Hortonworks is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character or location of



the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 Authority; Approvals and Enforceability.

(a) Hortonworks has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and subject only
to the approval of the Hortonworks Stockholders as described below, to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Hortonworks, and
performance by Hortonworks with its obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
have been duly and validly approved by the Hortonworks Board (the "Hortonworks
Board"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Hortonworks Board has
unanimously determined that this Agreement and the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of
the Hortonworks stockholders and has unanimously resolved to recommend that
the Hortonworks Stockholders adopt this Agreement (the "Hortonworks Voting
Proposal"). The Hortonworks Board has received an opinion of Qatalyst Partners
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject
to the various assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set
forth therein, the Exchange Ratio to be received pursuant to and in accordance
with, the terms of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Hortonworks
Common Stock (other than Cloudera or any Affiliate of Cloudera), is fair, from
a financial point of view, to such holders, and as of the date of this
Agreement, the foregoing opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified
in any respect.

(c) Except for the approval of the Hortonworks Voting Proposal by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Hortonworks Common Stock entitled to vote at a meeting of the Hortonworks
Stockholders called to consider the Hortonworks Voting Proposal (the
"Requisite Hortonworks Stockholder Approval") and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.23 of this Agreement, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Hortonworks are necessary to
approve or adopt this Agreement under applicable Legal Requirements and to
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms hereof.

(d) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Hortonworks, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Cloudera and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Hortonworks, enforceable against Hortonworks in accordance with
its terms, except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Legal
Requirements affecting creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.

3.3 Required Filings and Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery by Hortonworks of this Agreement do not, and
the performance by Hortonworks of its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement and the consummation by Hortonworks of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming receipt of the Requisite Hortonworks
Stockholder Approval conflict with or violate the Hortonworks Certificate of
Incorporation or the Hortonworks Bylaws or any Hortonworks Subsidiary
Documents, (ii) assuming receipt of the government approvals contemplated by
Section 3.3(b) conflict with or violate any Legal Requirements applicable to
Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their
respective properties is



bound or affected, (iii) require notice to or the consent of any Person under,
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default), or impair Hortonworks' or
any of its Subsidiaries' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any
third party under, or give to any third party any rights of termination,
amendment, payment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation
of a Lien on any of the properties or assets (including intangible assets) of
Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of
their respective properties is bound or affected, or (iv) give rise to or
result in any person having, or having the right to exercise, any preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal, rights to acquire or similar rights with
respect to any capital stock of Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets or properties, except in the case of the preceding
clauses (ii) through (iv), inclusive, as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery by Hortonworks of this Agreement do not, and
the performance by Hortonworks of its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement and the consummation by Hortonworks of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Merger) will not, require any consent,
approval, order, license, authorization, registration, declaration or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i)
as may be required by the HSR Act, (ii) the filing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act and as
may be required under the Securities Act, (iii) such consents, approvals,
orders, licenses, authorizations, registrations, declarations, permits,
filings, and notifications as may be required under applicable United States
federal and state securities laws, (iv) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger or other documents as required by the DGCL and (v) such other consents,
approvals, orders, registrations, declarations, permits, filings and
notifications which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Hortonworks Material Adverse
Effect.

3.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Hortonworks has heretofore made
available to Cloudera a complete and accurate copy of the Hortonworks
Certificate of Incorporation and Hortonworks Bylaws, along with the charter
and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) each as amended to date,
of each of its Subsidiaries (the "Hortonworks Subsidiary Documents"). The
Hortonworks Certificate of Incorporation, Hortonworks Bylaws and Hortonworks
Subsidiary Documents, each as amended to date, are in full force and effect,
and neither the Hortonworks Board nor, to the knowledge of Hortonworks, any
Hortonworks Stockholder has taken any action to amend the Hortonworks
Certificate of Incorporation or the Hortonworks Bylaws in any respect.
Hortonworks has not taken any action in breach or violation of any of the
provisions of the Hortonworks Certificate of Incorporation or the Hortonworks
Bylaws, and each Subsidiary is not in breach or violation of any of the
material provisions of their respective Hortonworks Subsidiary Documents,
except, in the case of a Subsidiary, as would not reasonably be expected to

together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and the
percentage of each Subsidiary's outstanding capital stock owned by Hortonworks
or another Subsidiary or Affiliate of Hortonworks, is set forth in Section 3.6
of the Hortonworks Disclosure Letter. Hortonworks does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity, voting or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any

publicly traded company held for investment by Hortonworks and comprising less
than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock of such company. Each
Subsidiary of Hortonworks is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Legal Requirements of its jurisdiction of organization (to
the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) and has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease
and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to conduct
its business as it is currently conducted, except to the extent that the
failure to be so organized or existing or in good standing or have such power
or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of
Hortonworks is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent such
concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the character or location of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 SEC Reports.

Hortonworks has filed and made available to Cloudera all forms, reports,
schedules, statements and other documents, including any exhibits thereto,
required to be filed by Hortonworks with the SEC since



January 1, 2017 (collectively, the "Hortonworks SEC Reports"). The Hortonworks
SEC Reports, including all forms, reports and documents filed by Hortonworks
with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (i) were

forms, reports and documents filed by Hortonworks with the SEC after the date
of this Agreement, will not as of the time they are filed, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such Hortonworks SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the

of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hortonworks and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded

arrangement or relationship between or among Hortonworks or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries in Hortonworks'
consolidated financial statements.

(f) Neither Hortonworks nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
Hortonworks, any director, officer, auditor, accountant, consultant or
representative of Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any substantive complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that Hortonworks or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No
current or former attorney representing Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Hortonworks or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the current the Hortonworks Board or any
committee thereof or to any current director or executive officer of
Hortonworks.

(g) To the knowledge of Hortonworks, no employee of Hortonworks or any of its
Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement
agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any applicable Legal Requirements of the
type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Hortonworks or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither Hortonworks nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the knowledge of Hortonworks, any director, officer, employee, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of Hortonworks or any such Subsidiary has discharged,
demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated
against an employee of Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries in the terms and
conditions of employment because of any lawful act of such employee described

other than (i) Liabilities incurred since the date of the Hortonworks Balance
Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii)
Liabilities under this Agreement or expressly permitted to be incurred under
this Agreement, and (iii) Liabilities that, individually and in the aggregate,
have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Hortonworks
Material Adverse Effect.

3.10 Subsequent Changes. Since the date of the Hortonworks Balance Sheet
through the date hereof, Hortonworks has conducted its business in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, since such date
through the date hereof, there has not occurred (i) any Hortonworks Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) any action taken by Hortonworks or event that would
have required the consent of Cloudera pursuant to Section 5.2(a), (c)-(e),
(f), (j)-(m), (p)-(r), (t) and (v) had such action or event occurred after the
date of this Agreement.

3.11 Real Property. Hortonworks and each of its Subsidiaries have good and
valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the real properties
which it purports to own or lease, including all the real properties reflected
in the Hortonworks Balance Sheet. All real properties reflected in the
Hortonworks



Balance Sheet are held free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected
on the Hortonworks Balance Sheet and Liens for current Taxes not yet due and
for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP and
other Liens that do not materially impair the use of the property subject
thereto. All real property leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
agreements to which Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
(collectively, the "Hortonworks Real Property Leases") are in full force and
effect, except where the failure of such Hortonworks Real Property Leases to
be in full force and effect would not be reasonably likely to result in a
Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect. There is no default by Hortonworks or any
of its Subsidiaries under any of the Hortonworks Real Property Leases, or, to
the knowledge of Hortonworks, defaults by any other party thereto, except such
defaults as have been waived in writing or cured or such defaults that in the
aggregate would not be reasonably likely to result in a Hortonworks Material
Adverse Effect. Section 3.11 of the Hortonworks Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of all Hortonworks Real Property Leases providing

Material Real Property Lease") and lists for each such Hortonworks Material

properties and assets reflected in the Hortonworks Balance Sheet. All tangible
properties and assets reflected in the Hortonworks Balance Sheet are held free
and clear of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Hortonworks Balance
Sheet and Liens for current Taxes not yet due and for which adequate reserves
have been established in accordance with GAAP and other Liens that do not
materially impair the use of the property or assets subject thereto. The
machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property
and assets owned, leased or used by Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries
are, in the aggregate, sufficient and adequate to carry on their respective
businesses in all material respects as conducted as of the date hereof, and
Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and have good title to,
or valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under contract to use, such
machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property
and assets that are material to Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, free and clear of all Liens, except for conditions or defects in title
that in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to result in a
Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect.

the knowledge of Hortonworks, subsisting, valid and enforceable.

(b) All Hortonworks Intellectual Property is owned by Hortonworks or one or
more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens (excluding any non-
exclusive licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business). To the
knowledge of Hortonworks, all material Hortonworks Intellectual Property is,
and following the transactions contemplated hereby shall be, freely
transferable, licensable and alienable without the consent of, or notice or
payment of any kind to any Governmental Authority or third party. Neither
Hortonworks nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted an exclusive license to

third party, of any material Technology or Intellectual Property Rights that
are or were owned by Hortonworks or a Subsidiary of Hortonworks.



(c) To the knowledge of Hortonworks, neither Hortonworks nor its Subsidiaries
has, in the conduct of the business of Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries as

license, any Intellectual Property Rights owned by any third Person except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business of Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Hortonworks, threatened
(and at no time within the three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement
has there been pending or threatened any) Legal Proceeding against Hortonworks
or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging that any activities, products or conduct
of Hortonworks' or any of its Subsidiaries' business infringes or will
infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person, or challenging the ownership, validity,
or enforceability of any rights in Hortonworks Intellectual Property.
Hortonworks is not party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents,
decrees, stipulations, judgments, or Orders resulting from Legal Proceedings,
which (i) materially restrict Hortonworks' or any of its Subsidiaries' rights
to use, license or transfer any material Hortonworks Intellectual Property, or
(ii) compel or require Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries to license or
transfer any material Hortonworks Intellectual Property. In the past three (3)
years, no indemnity claims have been asserted in writing or, to the knowledge
of Hortonworks, are threatened against Hortonworks or any Subsidiary of
Hortonworks by any customer alleging that any Hortonworks Product infringes
upon, violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person.

its Subsidiaries against any third party with respect to any Hortonworks
Intellectual Property, which remain unresolved as of the date hereof.

included in any Hortonworks Product or necessary to the development of any
Hortonworks Product, (ii) Contracts between Hortonworks or any Hortonworks

entered into in the ordinary course of business.

(f) Section 3.13(f) of the Hortonworks Disclosure Letter contains a complete

Hortonworks any other party to a Hortonworks IP License, is in material breach
of any such Hortonworks IP License that is material to the business of
Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result or cause: (A) (i) the breach
by Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries of any Hortonworks IP License, (ii)
the termination, impairment or restriction of any right or license granted to
Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries under a Hortonworks IP License, or
(iii) Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, or expand the scope of
a prior grant, to a



third party of any rights to any material Hortonworks Intellectual Property
(including by release of any source code that is not Open Source Software),
except (with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)) as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect or (B) as a result
of any Contract to which Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, a
third party to become licensed to, or otherwise have rights to, any material
Intellectual Property Rights of Cloudera or any of its Subsidiaries.

(h) To the knowledge of Hortonworks, Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all terms and conditions of any license for Open Source
Software, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the business of Hortonworks or any of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(i) No proprietary source code (excluding, for clarity, any Open Source
Software) for any Hortonworks Product has been delivered, licensed or made
available to any escrow agent or other third party who is not, as of the date
of this Agreement, or was not, at the time, an employee, consultant or
contractor of Hortonworks or a Subsidiary of Hortonworks. To the knowledge of
Hortonworks, neither Hortonworks nor any Subsidiary of Hortonworks has any
duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver,
license or make available the proprietary source code (excluding, for clarity,
any Open Source Software) for any Hortonworks Product to any escrow agent or
other third person, other than any employee, consultant or contractor of
Hortonworks or a Subsidiary of Hortonworks under confidentiality obligations
that prohibit the disclosure of such proprietary source code to any third
party.

(j) Each current and former employee, consultant and contractor of Hortonworks
or a Subsidiary of Hortonworks who was or is involved in the creation or
development of any Hortonworks Products, as well as any other material
Hortonworks Intellectual Property, has signed and delivered a written Contract
that assigns to Hortonworks or a Subsidiary of Hortonworks any such
Intellectual Property, except as would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the business of Hortonworks or
any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(k) Section 3.13(k) of the Hortonworks Disclosure Letter contains a list of
each standards-setting organization or similar organizations in which the
Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries has participated in the past three (3)
years, or is currently participating, that could require or obligate
Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any other Person
any license or right to use any Hortonworks Intellectual Property.

(l) No government funding, facilities of a university, college, other
educational institution or research center was used in the development of any
material Hortonworks Intellectual Property.

(m) The Processing by Hortonworks or any Subsidiary of Hortonworks of any
Personal Information, as well as all communications from Hortonworks and
Subsidiaries of Hortonworks to users, partners or customers (whether sent
directly or, to Hortonworks' knowledge, through third-party providers) has
complied in all material respects with (i) all Legal Requirements, (ii)
Hortonworks' and its Subsidiaries' existing contractual commitments with third
parties and (iii) Hortonworks' and its Subsidiaries' privacy policies and any
other terms applicable to the Processing of Personal Information from
individuals by Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their agents,
except where the failure to so comply would not constitute a Hortonworks
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no claims have been asserted
in writing or, to the knowledge of Hortonworks, are threatened in writing
against Hortonworks or any Subsidiary of Hortonworks by any third party
alleging a violation of any third party's privacy rights that would constitute
a Hortonworks Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Hortonworks,
neither



Hortonworks, any Subsidiary of Hortonworks or any of their service providers
has suffered any breach in security that has permitted or resulted in any
unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Information.

(n) To the knowledge of Hortonworks, the Hortonworks Products are free from
any defect, bug or programming, design or documentation error or disrupting,
disabling, harming or corrupting code that would constitute a Hortonworks
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Hortonworks, none of the
Hortonworks Products contain any "back door," "drop dead device," "time bomb,"
"Trojan horse," "virus" or "worm" (as such terms are commonly understood in
the software industry), vulnerability or any other similar malicious code
("Malicious Code") that would constitute a Hortonworks Material Adverse
Effect.

(o) Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries have information technology systems that
in their reasonable business judgment are sufficient in all material respects

currently conducted. Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
steps and implemented reasonable procedures to ensure that information
technology systems used in connection with the operation of Hortonworks and
its Subsidiaries, and data stored or transmitted on such systems are secure
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such systems are free from Malicious
Code, except as would not be reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

all requisite corporate or other power and authority necessary to enable it to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and
to conduct its business as it is currently conducted, except to the extent
that the failure to be so organized or existing or in good standing or have
such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Cloudera Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of
Cloudera is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent such
concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the character or location of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except to the extent that the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cloudera
Material Adverse Effect.

4.7 SEC Reports. Cloudera has filed and made available to Hortonworks all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents, including any
exhibits thereto, required to be filed by Cloudera with the SEC since January

of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
material transactions and dispositions of the assets of Cloudera and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Cloudera or any of its Subsidiaries in Cloudera's consolidated
financial statements.

(f) Neither Cloudera nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
Cloudera, any director, officer, auditor, accountant, consultant or
representative of Cloudera or any of its Subsidiaries has



received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any substantive complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that Cloudera or any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. No current or former attorney representing Cloudera or any of its
Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws,

officers, directors, employees or agents to the current the Cloudera Board or
any committee thereof or to any current director or executive officer of
Cloudera.

the date hereof, Cloudera has conducted its business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and, since such date through the date
hereof, there has not occurred (i) any Cloudera Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) any action taken by Cloudera or event that would have required the
consent of Hortonworks pursuant to Section 5.2(a), (c)-(e), (f), (j)-(m),
(p)-(r), (t) and (v) had such action or event occurred after the date of this
Agreement.

4.11 Real Property. Cloudera and each of its Subsidiaries have good and valid
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the real properties which it
purports to own or lease, including all the real properties reflected in the

All real property leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to
which Cloudera or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the
"Cloudera Real Property Leases") are in full force and effect, except where
the failure of such Cloudera Real Property Leases to be in full force and
effect would not be reasonably likely to result in a Cloudera Material Adverse
Effect. There is no default by Cloudera or any of its Subsidiaries under any
of the Cloudera Real Property Leases, or, to the knowledge of Cloudera,
defaults by any other party thereto, except such defaults as have been waived
in writing or cured or such defaults that in the aggregate would not be

whole, free and clear of all Liens, except for conditions or defects in title
that in the aggregate would not be reasonably likely to result in a Cloudera
Material Adverse Effect.

There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Cloudera, threatened (and at no
time within the three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement has there

Hortonworks shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest such action or proceeding and
have vacated or otherwise lifted any such Legal Requirement or Order,
including by effecting or committing to, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition
or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Cloudera and Hortonworks or their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) the licensing or provision of any software or other

or the provision of any software as Open Source Software, and (iii) the
imposition of any limitation or regulation on the ability of Cloudera and
Hortonworks or their respective Subsidiaries to freely conduct their business
or own such assets; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Cloudera nor Hortonworks nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to effect or commit to any of the
foregoing, or required to effect or commit to any other actions, if doing so
would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial
condition or results of operations of Cloudera and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, following the Merger.



7.3 Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Cloudera and Hortonworks shall jointly prepare, and Cloudera shall
file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 in connection with the
issuance of shares of Cloudera Common Stock in the Merger (as may be amended
or supplemented from time to time, the "Registration Statement"), in such form
as may be approved by Cloudera and Hortonworks, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Registration Statement
shall include (i) a prospectus for the issuance of shares of Cloudera Common
Stock in the Merger (including shares of Cloudera Common Stock issued in the
Merger in exchange for shares of Hortonworks Restricted Stock), (ii) a proxy
statement of Cloudera for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies
for the Cloudera Voting Proposal to be considered at the Cloudera Stockholder
Meeting, and (iii) a proxy statement of Hortonworks for use in connection with
the solicitation of proxies for the Hortonworks Voting Proposal to be
considered at the Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting (as may be amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each
of Cloudera and Hortonworks shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing with the SEC. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of Hortonworks and Cloudera shall, and
shall cause its respective Representatives to, fully cooperate with the other
party hereto and its respective Representatives in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall
furnish the other party hereto with all information concerning it and its
Affiliates as the other party hereto may deem reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto,
and each of Cloudera and Hortonworks shall provide the other party hereto with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. As promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC,
Cloudera and Hortonworks shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to their respective stockholders.

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the
approval of Cloudera and Hortonworks, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that Cloudera, in
connection with a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, and Hortonworks, in
connection with a Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change, may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment
to effect such change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in
this Section 7.3(b) shall apply only with respect to such information relating
to the other party or its business, financial condition or results of
operations, and shall be subject to the right of each party to have its board
of directors' deliberations and conclusions be accurately described therein.

(c) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall comply
in all material respects as to form and substance with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement
shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or
declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not,
on the date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, at



the time of each of the Merger Stockholder Meetings, or as of the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. In addition, the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to
Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a‑12 under the
Exchange Act (each, a "Regulation M‑A Filing") shall not, at the time any such
Regulation M‑A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) Hortonworks and Cloudera shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement,
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any such
document would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements or the SEC, disseminated to the Hortonworks
Stockholders and/or the Cloudera Stockholders. Hortonworks and Cloudera shall
each notify the other as promptly as practicable of (i) the receipt by such
party of any written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any
written or oral request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to, the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives and the SEC or its
staff with respect to any of the foregoing filings, (ii) the issuance of any
stop order, or (iii) the suspension of qualification for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction of the Cloudera Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger.

(e) Hortonworks and Cloudera shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. In addition, Cloudera shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions required under any applicable federal or state
securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Cloudera Common Stock in the Merger.

7.4 Stockholder Meetings and Board Recommendations.

(a) Each of Hortonworks and Cloudera, acting through its board of directors,
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements,
applicable rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the case of Hortonworks
or the NYSE in the case of Cloudera, the Hortonworks Certificate of
Incorporation and the Hortonworks Bylaws in the case of Hortonworks, and the
Cloudera Certificate of Incorporation and the Cloudera Bylaws in the case of
Cloudera, to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the
declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, a meeting of its
stockholders (including any postponement or adjournment thereof in accordance
with this Agreement, the "Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting" in the case of
Hortonworks, and the "Cloudera Stockholder Meeting" in the case of Cloudera,
and together, the "Merger Stockholder Meetings") for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the approval of the Hortonworks Voting Proposal in
the case of Hortonworks and the Cloudera Voting Proposal in the case of
Cloudera. Each of Hortonworks and Cloudera may postpone or adjourn the
Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting or Cloudera Stockholder meeting, respectively,
(i) with the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) if a quorum has not
been established, (iii) to allow



reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Hortonworks Board or the Cloudera Board, as
applicable, has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is necessary under applicable Legal Requirements and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
Hortonworks or Cloudera stockholders, as applicable, prior to the Hortonworks
Stockholder Meeting or Cloudera Stockholder Meeting; (iv) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent the
Requisite Hortonworks Stockholder Approval or Requisite Cloudera Stockholder
Approval, as applicable, would not otherwise be obtained; or (v) if required
by Legal Requirements; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (ii),
(iii), (iv) and (v), each of the Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting and the
Cloudera Stockholder Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned (x) for more
than ten (10) business days in the aggregate from its originally scheduled
date without the prior written consent of the other party or (y) beyond the
Initial Termination Date (or if applicable, the Extended Termination Date);
provided, further, that in the event that either party postpones or adjourns
the Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting or the Cloudera Stockholder Meeting, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the other party
may postpone or adjourn its meeting for an equal number of days. Each of
Hortonworks and Cloudera shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the Hortonworks Voting Proposal in the case of Hortonworks and the Cloudera
Voting Proposal in the case of Cloudera, and unless the board of directors of
either party hereto shall effect a Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change in
the case of Hortonworks or a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change in the case
of Cloudera, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.4(f),
use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Hortonworks
Stockholder Approval in the case of Hortonworks and the Requisite Cloudera
Stockholder Approval in the case of Cloudera. Each of Hortonworks and Cloudera
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with its Merger Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance
with the DGCL, the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the case of
Hortonworks or the NYSE in the case of Cloudera, the Hortonworks Certificate
of Incorporation and the Hortonworks Bylaws in the case of Hortonworks, and

of Cloudera, and all other applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) Each of Hortonworks and Cloudera shall use its reasonable best efforts to
call, give notice of, convene and hold their respective Merger Stockholder
Meetings on the same day and at the same time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of Hortonworks or Cloudera, after
consultation with the other party hereto, may (but shall not be required to)
adjourn or postpone its respective Merger Stockholder Meeting if (and solely
to the extent and for the minimum duration reasonably necessary to ensure
that) (i) any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to its respective stockholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of its respective Merger Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the applicable Merger Stockholder
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Hortonworks Common
Stock in the case of Hortonworks, or Cloudera Common Stock in the case of
Cloudera, represented (either in person or by proxy) at the respective Merger
Stockholder meeting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the respective Merger Stockholder Meeting, or (iii) the other party hereto
has adjourned or postponed its Merger Stockholder Meeting for any of the
foregoing reasons.

(c) Following the Merger Stockholder Meetings and at or prior to the Closing,
each of Hortonworks and Cloudera shall deliver to the corporate secretary of
the other party hereto a certificate setting forth the voting results from the
respective Merger Stockholder Meeting.

(d) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 7.4(a),
Hortonworks shall submit the Hortonworks Voting Proposal to the Hortonworks
Stockholders at the Hortonworks Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of acting
upon such proposal, and Cloudera shall submit the Cloudera Voting Proposal to
the Cloudera Stockholders at the Cloudera Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of acting



upon such proposal, in each case whether or not (i) the Hortonworks Board or
the Cloudera Board, as the case may be, at any time subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Merger Stockholder Meetings shall effect a
Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change in the case of Hortonworks or a
Cloudera Board Recommendation Change in the case of Cloudera, or (ii) any
actual, potential or purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has
been commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Hortonworks Board in
the case of Hortonworks or the Cloudera Board in the case of Cloudera.

(e) Subject to the terms of Section 7.4(f), (i) the Hortonworks Board shall
recommend that the Hortonworks Stockholders adopt this Agreement at the
Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL (the "Hortonworks Board Recommendation"), and (ii) the Cloudera
Board shall recommend that the Cloudera Stockholders approve the issuance of
shares of Cloudera Common Stock in the Merger at the Cloudera Stockholder
Meeting in accordance with the applicable rules of the NYSE (the "Cloudera
Board Recommendation").

(f) Subject to the terms of this Section 7.4(f), (x) neither the Hortonworks
Board (nor any committee thereof) shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify,
qualify or condition, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, qualify or condition, the Hortonworks Board Recommendation (a
"Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change"), and (y) neither the Cloudera Board
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify or
condition, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, qualify
or condition, the Cloudera Board Recommendation (a "Cloudera Board
Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Hortonworks
Stockholder Approval in the case of Hortonworks, or receipt of the Requisite
Cloudera Stockholder Approval in the case of Cloudera, the Hortonworks Board
may effect a Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change and the Cloudera Board
may effect a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, and, in either case if and
only if either:

(i) (A) the party proposing to take such action has received an Acquisition
Proposal relating to such party that the board of directors has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from or arise out of a breach of any provisions of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2
(as modified by Section 6.3), and the Person from whom such party received
such Acquisition Proposal has not made any other Acquisition Proposals (either
alone or together with one or more other Persons) that resulted from or arose
out of a breach of any provisions of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 (as modified
by Section 6.3), (C) the party proposing to take such action has not breached
any of the provisions of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 (as modified by Section
6.3) in respect of such Acquisition Proposal (and any other Acquisition
Proposals made by the same Person making such Acquisition Proposal, whether
alone or together with one or more other Persons), (D) prior effecting such
Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change or a Cloudera Board Recommendation
Change, as the case may be, the party proposing to take such action shall have
given the other party hereto at least five (5) business days' notice thereof
(which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Hortonworks Board
Recommendation Change or a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change) and the
opportunity to meet and discuss in good faith potential amendments or other
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be effected (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms, or any
other material amendment to the terms, of such Acquisition Proposal shall
require a new written notice and an additional three (3) business day period
for discussion), (E) the other party hereto shall not have made, within the
foregoing notice periods after receipt of such party's written notice of its
intention to effect a Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change or a Cloudera
Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, a counteroffer or proposal
that the board of directors of the party proposing to take such action
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor of
nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel)



is at least as favorable to its stockholders as such Superior Proposal, and
(F) after such discussions, the board of directors of the party proposing to
take such action determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and after considering in good faith any counteroffer or proposal
made by the other party hereto pursuant to the immediately preceding clause
(E)) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law; or

(ii) in response to an Intervening Event, if: (A) the Intervening Event does
not involve the receipt of any offer, proposal or inquiry from any third party
relating to a transaction of the nature described in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" (which, for the purposes of this clause (A), shall
be read without reference to the percentage thresholds set forth in the
definition thereof); and (B) (1) prior to effecting the Hortonworks Board
Recommendation Change or the Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, as the case
may be, the party proposing to take such action shall have given the other
party hereto at least five (5) business days' notice thereof (which notice
shall not, by itself, constitute a Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change or
a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and
discuss in good faith the purported basis for the proposed Hortonworks Board
Recommendation Change or Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, as the case may
be, the other party's reaction thereto and potential amendments and
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in response
thereto so that the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be effected (it being understood and agreed that any material
change to the facts and circumstances of such Intervening Event shall require
a new written notice and an additional five (5) business day period for
discussion), and (2) after such discussions, the board of directors of the
party proposing to take such action determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect such
Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change or Cloudera Board Recommendation
Change, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

Each of Hortonworks and Cloudera acknowledge and hereby agree that any
Hortonworks Board Recommendation Change or Cloudera Board Recommendation
Change effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal may be made solely and exclusively pursuant to
the immediately preceding clause (i) only, and may not be made pursuant to the
immediately preceding clause (ii), and any Hortonworks Board Recommendation
Change or Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, may only
be made pursuant to this Section 7.4(f) and no other provisions of this
Agreement.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Hortonworks Board or the
Cloudera Board from taking and disclosing to the Hortonworks Stockholders or
the Cloudera Stockholders, respectively, a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that neither
Hortonworks (with respect to statements made by the Hortonworks Board) nor
Cloudera (with respect to statements made by the Cloudera Board) pursuant to
Rule 14e‑2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14(d)‑9 under the Exchange Act
shall make disclosures that would amount to a Hortonworks Board Recommendation
Change or a Cloudera Board Recommendation Change, other than pursuant to
Section 7.4(f).

(h) Nothing set forth in this Section 7.4 shall (i) permit either party hereto
to terminate this Agreement, (ii) affect any other obligation of the parties
hereto under this Agreement, (iii) limit the obligation of either party hereto
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold its respective Merger
Stockholder Meeting, (iv) relieve either party hereto of its obligation to
submit to a vote of its stockholders the Hortonworks Voting Proposal or the
Cloudera Voting Proposal, as applicable, at its respective Merger Stockholder
Meeting, or (v) permit either party hereto to submit for a vote of its
respective stockholders at



or prior to its respective Merger Stockholder Meeting any Acquisition Proposal
other than the Hortonworks Voting Proposal and the Cloudera Voting Proposal,
as applicable.

its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Cloudera or the Surviving

Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time

result in duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time,
Cloudera shall, or shall cause (or, with respect to employees outside of the
United States, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause) the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Cloudera or its
affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements and the insured benefits carrier, provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any eligible expenses incurred that were credited to
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket co-insurance requirements under any
Continuing Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or vision benefits in
the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any corresponding medical,
dental or vision plans of Cloudera or the Surviving Corporation.

(e) Change in Control. Each of Cloudera and Hortonworks hereby acknowledge
that the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby may or may be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" (or other similar phrase) for purposes of each Cloudera Employee Plan
and Hortonworks Employee Plan, respectively, each as listed on Schedule
7.7(e). From and after the Closing, Cloudera shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, be bound by, honor and comply with the terms of each
employment, severance and change in control plan, policy and agreement listed
in Schedule 7.7(e), except as may otherwise be modified by mutual agreement
with the counterparty prior to the Effective Time.

(f) No Third Party Rights. The provisions of this Section 7.7 are not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, and the parties hereby expressly disclaim the creation or
establishment of any third party beneficiary rights (whether express or
implied) under or by right of the terms of this Section 7.7. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to amend any Employee Benefit Plan to reflect the terms of
this Section 7.7.

7.8 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Cloudera shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of Hortonworks and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time between Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes
a director or officer of Hortonworks or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Cloudera shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, cause their respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that are
at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of Hortonworks and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any respect except as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Cloudera shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the existing policy of Hortonworks' directors' and
officers' liability insurance (the "DandO Policy") covering claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in



connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent that such acts or
omissions are covered by the DandO Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party
who is covered as of the Effective Time by the DandO Policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall Cloudera
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount
in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by Hortonworks (which
annual premium is set forth on Section 7.8(b) of the Hortonworks Disclosure
Letter) for such insurance (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"),
provided that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in lieu of its obligations under this Section 7.8(b),
Cloudera or Hortonworks may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
DandO Policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Policy,
and in the event that Cloudera shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Cloudera shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder in lieu
of all other obligations of Cloudera and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.8(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full
force and effect.

(c) The obligations under this Section 7.8 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or the
"tail" policy referred to in Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or
the "tail" policy referred to in Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section
7.8(b) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
Section 7.8(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 7.8
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by Hortonworks or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law or in equity).

(d) In the event that Cloudera, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other person,
then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable),
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.8.

7.9 Listing of Cloudera Shares. Cloudera shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have authorized for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, upon
official notice of issuance, the shares of Cloudera Common Stock issuable in
the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, the shares of Cloudera Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all Assumed Options and the shares of Cloudera
Common Stock issuable in respect of all Assumed Units.

7.10 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Hortonworks and the Hortonworks Board shall promptly grant such approvals and
take such lawful actions as are necessary so that the Merger and/or such



other transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, on the Merger and such other transactions.

7.11 Section 16 Matters. The Cloudera Board, or a committee thereof consisting
of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b‑3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by Hortonworks Insiders of Cloudera
Common Stock in exchange for shares of Hortonworks Common Stock, and of
options to purchase Cloudera Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of
the Hortonworks Stock Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16 Information, is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b‑3 under
the Exchange Act. In addition, the Hortonworks Board, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b‑3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Hortonworks Insiders of
Hortonworks Common Stock in exchange for shares of Cloudera Common Stock, and
the disposition of their Hortonworks Stock Awards which will be deemed to
occur upon the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion into
options to purchase Cloudera Common Stock, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed
in the Section 16 Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule
16b‑3 under the Exchange Act.

7.12 Tax Matters.

(a) Prior to or following the Effective Time, none of Cloudera, Merger Sub or
Hortonworks shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries to, take (or fail to take) any action which action (or failure to
act) would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) Each of Cloudera and Hortonworks shall use its reasonable best efforts and
will cooperate with one another to obtain the Tax opinions described in
Section 2.2(a)(vii) (collectively, the "Tax Opinions"). In connection
therewith, (a) officers of Cloudera and Merger Sub shall execute and deliver
to Fenwick and West LLP, counsel to Cloudera (or other counsel selected by
Cloudera and reasonably satisfactory to Hortonworks), and Latham and Watkins
LLP, counsel to Hortonworks (or other counsel selected by Hortonworks and
reasonably satisfactory to Cloudera), certificates containing such customary
representations as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable each
such counsel to render the opinion described in Section 2.2(a)(vii), as
applicable, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"Cloudera Tax Certificate"), (b) officers of Hortonworks shall execute and
deliver to each such counsel a certificate containing such customary
representations as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable each
such counsel to render the opinion described in Section 2.2(a)(vii), as
applicable, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the
"Hortonworks Tax Certificate"), in each case of (a) and (b), dated as of the
Closing Date (and, such other dates as reasonably requested by such counsel in
connection with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), and (c) Cloudera and
Hortonworks shall provide such other information as reasonably requested by
each such counsel for purposes of rendering the opinion described in Section
2.2(a)(vii), as applicable.

(c) The parties will take the position for all Tax purposes that the Merger
qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, unless a contrary position is required by a final determination within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.



7.13 Obligations of Merger Sub. Cloudera shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

8.1 Cloudera Board of Directors.

(a) Board of Directors. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Cloudera
Board shall include, (i) five (5) members who shall be designated by Cloudera
and shall, if such persons are members of the Cloudera Board immediately prior
to the Effective Time, be the persons set forth on Schedule 8.1 with respect
to Cloudera (each, a "Cloudera Designee"), (ii) four (4) members who shall be
designated by Hortonworks and shall, if such persons are members of the
Hortonworks Board immediately prior to the Effective Time, be the persons set
forth on Schedule 8.1 with respect to Hortonworks (each, a "Hortonworks

extent that there is mutual agreement by a majority of the collective
independent directors among the Cloudera Designees and Hortonworks Designees;
provided that for the avoidance of doubt, if no such additional members shall
be determined pursuant to this clause (iii) prior to the Effective Time, then
no such person shall be designated prior to the Effective Time, it being the
intent that in such event the then‑Cloudera Board (and its Nominating and
Governance Committee) will continue to assess additional directors in
accordance with such review, evaluation and recruiting process following the
Effective Time. Schedule 8.1 sets forth, with respect to each Cloudera
Designee and each Hortonworks Designee, the class in which each such Cloudera
Designee and each such Hortonworks Designee shall serve, the year in which
such class is up for reelection, and the committees on which each such
Cloudera Designee and each such Hortonworks Designee shall serve. In the event
any Cloudera Designee or any Hortonworks Designee is not a member of the
Cloudera Board or the Hortonworks Board, respectively, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each of Cloudera and Hortonworks shall be entitled to
replace such Cloudera Designee or Hortonworks Designee, as the case may be,
with a another individual serving on the Cloudera Board (in the case of a
Cloudera Designee) or Hortonworks Board (in the case of a Hortonworks
Designee) immediately prior to the Effective Time to serve as a director in
place of the individual originally selected (the "Substitute Designee");
provided, that, in the case of a Substitute Designee selected by Cloudera,
such Substitute Designee shall be reasonably acceptable to Hortonworks, and in
the case of a Substitute Designee selected by Hortonworks, such Substitute
Designee shall be reasonably acceptable to Cloudera.

(b) Chairman. Immediately following the Effective Time, the chairman of the
board of directors of Cloudera shall be Martin Cole.

8.2 Cloudera Executive Officers. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
chief executive office, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of
Cloudera shall be the persons identified on Schedule 8.2 with respect to such
positions, if such persons are employees of Cloudera or Hortonworks as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

8.3 Effectuation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Cloudera Board shall take
all action necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 8.1 and Section
8.2.



ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

9.1 Termination. Notwithstanding the prior receipt of the Requisite
Hortonworks Stockholder Approval and/or the Requisite Cloudera Stockholder
Approval, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time (it being agreed that the party hereto
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall give prompt
written notice of such termination to the other party hereto):

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Hortonworks Board and the
Cloudera Board;

(b) by either Cloudera or Hortonworks, if any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have (i) enacted, issued, promulgated, entered,
enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger any Legal Requirement that is in
effect and has the permanent effect of making the consummation of the Merger
illegal, or which has the effect of permanently prohibiting, preventing or
otherwise restraining the consummation of the Merger, or (ii) issued or
granted any Order that is in effect and has the effect of making the Merger
illegal or which has the permanent effect of prohibiting, preventing or
otherwise restraining the Merger, and such Order has become final and non-
appealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall have complied with its obligations under
Section 7.1(a)(iv) to have any such Order vacated or lifted or removed;

(c) by either Cloudera or Hortonworks, if the Merger shall have not been
consummated by July 3, 2019 (the "Initial Termination Date"); provided,
however, that in the event the condition to the consummation of the Merger set
forth in Section 2.2(a)(v) (or Section 2.2(a)(i) or Section 2.2(a)(ii), to the
extent related to Section 2.2(a)(v) or the HSR Act) shall not have been
satisfied on or prior to the Initial Termination Date and all of the other
conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Section 2.2 shall
have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the Initial Termination Date
(other than those conditions that by their terms contemplate satisfaction at
the Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being satisfied
at such time), either Cloudera or Hortonworks may elect to extend the Initial
Termination Date by written notice to the other party hereto prior to or on
the Initial Termination Date, until January 3, 2020 (the "Extended Termination
Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this proviso shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or
failure to fulfill any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been
the proximate cause of, or resulted in, any of the conditions to the
consummation of the Merger set forth in Section 2.2(a) having failed to be
satisfied or fulfilled on or prior to the Initial Termination Date or the
Extended Termination Date, as applicable, and such action or failure to
fulfill any covenant or obligation constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement;

(d) by either Cloudera or Hortonworks if:

(i) the Requisite Cloudera Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained
at the Cloudera Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which a vote was taken on the Cloudera Voting Proposal), or

(ii) if the Requisite Hortonworks Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained at the Hortonworks Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote was taken on the Hortonworks Voting
Proposal);

(e) by either Cloudera or Hortonworks (provided it is not then in material
breach of any of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement) in the
event of (i) a breach of any covenant or



obligation set forth in this Agreement by the other party hereto, or (ii) any
inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties of the other party
hereto set forth in this Agreement when made or at any time prior to the
Effective Time, in either case such that the conditions to the consummation of
the Merger set forth in Section 2.2(b)(i) or Section 2.2(b)(ii) in the case of
Cloudera, or Section 2.2(c)(i) or Section 2.2(c)(ii) in the case of
Hortonworks, would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation and warranty became inaccurate; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such breach or
inaccuracy is curable through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts
by the party committing such breach or making such inaccurate representations
and warranties, then the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(e) shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) until the expiration of a thirty (30) calendar
day period after delivery of written notice of such breach or inaccuracy to
the party committing such breach or making such inaccurate representations and
warranties (it being understood that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if such breach or inaccuracy is cured by the
other party hereto within such thirty (30) calendar day period); or

(f)

(i) by Cloudera, if a Hortonworks Triggering Event shall have occurred,
whether promptly after the Hortonworks Triggering Event giving rise to
Cloudera's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(f)(i) or at any time thereafter; or

(ii) by Hortonworks, if a Cloudera Triggering Event shall have occurred,
whether promptly after the Cloudera Triggering Event giving rise to
Hortonworks' right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(f)(ii) or at any time thereafter.



9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or any of its
directors, officers, affiliates or stockholders except (i) that the provisions
of this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X shall survive any termination
of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement or for fraud. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement as
provided therein.

9.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 9.3, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses,
