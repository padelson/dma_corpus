ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE ACQUIRED INTERESTS; CLOSING

2.1 Purchase and Sale of the Acquired Interests. Upon the terms and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in this Agreement, at
the Closing, each of the Seller Parties shall sell, assign, convey, transfer
and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and accept from each of
the Seller Parties, the Acquired Interests, free and clear of all Liens, set
forth opposite such Seller Party's name on Section 2.1 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

2.2 Payments at Closing.

(a) Closing Purchase Price Payment. At the Closing, the Buyer shall issue to
the Principal Seller the Specified Buyer Common Stock, and pay to the
Principal Seller (for its own benefit and for the benefit of the other Seller
Party) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in writing by the Principal Seller (which account shall be so
designated at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date) an aggregate
amount (such aggregate amount, the "Closing Cash Purchase Price") equal to (i)
$135,000,000; minus (ii) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness; minus (iii) an amount equal to the Estimated Transaction
Expenses; minus (iv) the Purchase Price Escrow Amount; minus (v) the
Indemnification Escrow Amount; plus (vi) the Approved New Frac Fleet Amount,
if any; plus (vii) the Reimbursed CapEx Amount, if any, and either plus (viii)
the amount equal to the Estimated Working Capital Excess, if any or minus (ix)
the amount equal to the Estimated Working Capital Deficit, if any.

(b) Transaction Expenses. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be
paid, on behalf of the Seller Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable to the applicable payees set forth on Section 2.2(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and any other Person to whom Transaction Expenses are
owed, and the Estimated Transaction Expenses pursuant to the delivery
instructions provided in the applicable Invoices; 

(c) Closing Debt Payments. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be
paid, on behalf of the Seller Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable to the applicable lenders identified in Section 2.2(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and any other holder of Closing Indebtedness, the
applicable amounts in respect of the Closing Indebtedness pursuant to the
delivery instructions provided in the applicable Payoff Letters.

(d) Escrow Amounts.

(i) At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent, the Purchase Price Escrow
Amount for the Escrow Agent to hold in an account (the "Purchase Price Escrow
Account") and disburse solely in accordance with this Agreement and the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

(ii) At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent, the
Indemnification Escrow Amount for the Escrow Agent to hold in an account (the
"Indemnification Escrow Account") and disburse solely in accordance with this
Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Board Observer Rights. For so long as the Principal Seller and its members
own at least 50% of the Specified Buyer Common Stock, the Principal Seller or
one of its members, as designated by the Principal Seller, will be provided
with the right to appoint one board observer (the "Observer"), subject to
compliance with applicable Law, to attend meetings of the board of directors
of the Buyer (the "Board"), but not vote on any matter before the Board;
provided that Principal Seller's appointment right shall terminate
automatically upon (i) Principal Seller's, White Deer's or any of their
respective Affiliate's acquisition of or agreement to acquire a controlling
interest in any Person or business or (ii) entry into or engagement by any
Person in which the Principal Seller, White Deer or any of their respective
Affiliates has a controlling interest in any business, in either case that
competes directly with the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in the hydraulic fracturing business in the Market Area (an
"Observer Termination Event"). For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no
Observer Termination Event as a result of any controlling interest held by the
Principal Seller, White Deer or any of their respective Affiliates in O-Tex
Holdings, Inc. or Patriot Well Solutions LLC to the extent such interest was
acquired prior to the Closing. Principal Seller shall provide prior written
notice of any event that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
constitute, an Observer Termination Event. Immediately upon any Observer
Termination Event, any Observer appointed by the Principal Seller shall no
longer be entitled to serve as an observer of the Board. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer may exclude from any portion of any meeting of the Board,
the Observer to the extent such portion of any meeting will address a conflict
between the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Principal Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand. The Buyer may
also exclude from any portion of any meeting of the Board the Observer to the
extent the provision of such access would reasonably be expected to compromise
attorney-client privilege for the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Principal Seller's designation rights shall not be
transferable by the Principal Seller or its initial designee to any other
Person. 

2.3 Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer and delivery of the Acquired Interests to the Buyer and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will
take place at the offices of Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New
York, New York 10022 on the last Business Day of the month ending at least
five Business Days following the day in which all of the conditions set forth
in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions which by their terms are only
capable of being satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived by the Party or
Parties entitled to waive such conditions, unless another time, date and place
are agreed to in writing by the Parties. The date of the Closing is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date." The Closing will be deemed
effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York, New York time, on the Closing Date.

2.4 Deliveries and Actions at Closing.

(a) Buyer Deliveries and Actions. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered to the Principal Seller:

(iii) a duly executed counterpart to the CVR Agreement; 

(iv) a duly executed counterpart to the Lock-Up Agreement;

(vii) the certificate contemplated by Section 7.2(f);

(viii) the invoices or good faith reasonable estimates from each of the

(ix) the invoices and proof of payments made in respect of the Approved New

(c) Company Deliveries and Actions. At, or prior to, the Closing, the Company

2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Principal
Seller shall prepare and deliver, or shall cause to be prepared and delivered,
to the Buyer a statement setting forth the Principal Seller's good faith
estimate of the (i) Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"); (ii) the Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction
Expenses"); (iii) the Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital")
calculated in accordance with GAAP and to the extent consistent with GAAP,
prepared in a manner consistent with the Working Capital Calculation,
including a calculation of the Working Capital Deficit or the Working Capital
Excess, as the case may be; (iv) the Approved New Frac Fleet Amount, if any;
(v) the Reimbursed CapEx Amount, if any, and (vi) the Closing Cash Purchase
Price resulting therefrom; provided that, if the Buyer indicates in writing to
the Principal Seller at least two Business Days prior to the Closing that it
does not agree with Principal Seller's calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital, then the Buyer and the Principal Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to mutually reconcile such dispute and if any adjustments
are made thereto, then the adjusted calculation of the Estimated Working
Capital, as so mutually reconciled, shall be the Estimated Working Capital.

(b) Within 60 calendar days following the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Principal Seller a statement (the
"Closing Statement"), 

which shall include (i) a calculation of the Closing Indebtedness; (ii) a
calculation of the Closing Transaction Expenses; (iii) a calculation of
Working Capital, including a calculation of the Working Capital Deficit or the
Working Capital Excess, as the case may be; (iv) a calculation of the Approved
New Frac Fleet Amount, if any; (v) a calculation of the Reimbursed CapEx
Amount, if any, and (vi) the Buyer's determination of the final Closing Cash
Purchase Price (the "Final Cash Purchase Price") resulting therefrom. The
Principal Seller shall have a period of 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Closing Statement to review such documents and make any objections in writing
to the Buyer (the "Seller Objection Notice"); provided that the Seller
Objection Notice shall specify the amount of each such objection along with a
reasonable basis and supporting documentation to substantiate each such
objection. Any items not specifically objected to in the Seller Objection
Notice will be deemed agreed upon as set forth in the Closing Statement. For
purposes of the Principal Seller's evaluation of the Closing Statement, the
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to make available or provide, upon
advance notice and during normal business hours, reasonable access to such
information, books and records and data as may be reasonably requested by the
Principal Seller to analyze the Closing Statement. If the Principal Seller
delivers a Seller Objection Notice to the Buyer within such 30-day period,
then the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall attempt to resolve the matter or
matters in dispute. If no Seller Objection Notice is delivered by the
Principal Seller within such 30-day period, then the Closing Statement shall
be final and binding on the Parties. If disputes with respect to the Closing
Statement cannot be resolved by the Buyer and the Principal Seller within 30
calendar days after timely delivery of a Seller Objection Notice, then, at the
request of the Buyer or the Principal Seller the specific items remaining in
dispute (but no others) shall be submitted to such independent accounting or
consulting firm as shall be mutually agreed to by the Principal Seller and the
Buyer (the "Auditors"), which firm shall render its determination as to such
specific items remaining in dispute. If no such referral is made within 45
days after the delivery of a Seller Objection Notice, then the Closing
Statement (as submitted by the Buyer) shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The matters to be resolved by the Auditors shall be limited to the
unresolved items remaining in dispute between the Buyer and the Principal
Seller. The Auditors shall promptly deliver to the Buyer and the Principal
Seller a written report setting forth its resolution of the disputes and the
reasonable basis for each of its determinations, along with its determination
of the Final Cash Purchase Price, which shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the principles set forth in this Agreement and shall be final
and binding on the Parties. Prior to and until the delivery of the Auditors'
written report, there shall be no ex parte communications between either Party
and the Auditors. The fees and expenses of the Auditors shall be borne in the
same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted to the Auditor that are unsuccessfully disputed by
Principal Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, as
finally determined by the Auditors, bears to the total dollar amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted. By way of example only, if closing
accounts receivable is the only disputed item submitted to the Auditors, and
Principal Seller claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000, and the
Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Principal Seller, and if
the Auditors ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Principal Seller
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Auditors will
be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 / 500) to the Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500) to
the Principal Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing Cash Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) shall be the
"Final Cash Purchase Price" for the purposes of this Agreement. 

(c) If the Final Cash Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Cash Purchase Price,
then (x) then within two Business Days following the final determination
thereof, the Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the accounts designated by the Principal Seller the amount of the excess
and (y) the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release all of
the funds held in the Purchase Price Escrow Account to the Principal Seller
for the benefit of the Seller Parties. If the Closing Cash Purchase Price is
greater than the Final Cash Purchase Price (such excess, the "Buyer
Disbursement") and the Buyer Disbursement (i) is less than the amount in the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release (A) the amount equal to the Buyer Disbursement from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account to the Buyer and (B) the remaining amount in the
Purchase Price Escrow Account to the Seller Parties as directed by the
Principal Seller; (ii) is (A) equal to or (B) exceeds the amount in the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release all of the funds held in the Purchase Price Escrow Account to
the Buyer, and in the case of clause (ii)(B) the Seller Parties shall each
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) pay their respective
portion of the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Buyer.

2.6 Tax Treatment of Purchase of the Acquired Interests; Allocation. For
income Tax purposes, the Buyer's purchase of the Acquired Interests will be
treated in a manner consistent with Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1
C.B. 432 (Jan. 15, 1999) as (i) a sale of the Acquired Interests by the Seller
Parties and (ii) a purchase of all the assets of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries by the Buyer, and the Buyer and the Seller Parties shall report
such purchase on their respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
treatment. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to
the Principal Seller an allocation of the Closing Cash Purchase Price (or, if
determined prior to such time, the Final Cash Purchase Price), the Specified
Buyer Common Stock and any other items constituting consideration for
applicable Tax purposes (the "Consideration") among the assets of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with Sections 755 and 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder for the Principal Seller's review
and comment (the "Proposed Allocation"). The Principal Seller shall review the
Proposed Allocation and shall deliver to the Buyer within 30 days of receipt
of the Proposed Allocation a notice specifying in reasonable detail any
objection the Principal Seller may have in respect of the Proposed Allocation,
it being understood that failure to timely deliver any such notice will
preclude the Principal Seller from thereafter raising any such objection. If
the Principal Seller delivers an objection notice in accordance with the
preceding sentence, then the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objections set forth in such
notice within 20 days of delivery of such notice. To the extent that any
objection remains at the end of such 20-day period, the Buyer and the
Principal Seller shall each submit its proposed valuation with respect to each
disputed item to the Auditors, who shall be directed to determine which of the
two proposed valuations is closest to constituting the correct fair market
value, and the selected valuation shall thereafter constitute the amount of
the Consideration allocated to such item for purposes of this Section 2.6. The
fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be borne in the same proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Auditor
are unsuccessfully disputed by the Principal Seller, on the one hand, and the
Buyer, on the other hand, as finally determined by 

the Auditors, bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items so
submitted. The Proposed Allocation, as adjusted to reflect the resolution of
any disputed item whether by agreement of the parties or by decision of the
Auditor, and adjusted to take into account any adjustment to the Consideration
pursuant to this agreement, shall constitute the "Final Allocation," and the
Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with
the Final Allocation in all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to any
statements required under Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(3) and any
allocation required under Section 755 of the Code), and neither the Buyer, any
of the Seller Parties nor any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
position in any such Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation
in each case, unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code. Each of the Buyer and the Principal Seller agree to
promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the Final Allocation.

forward-looking disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking
statements or any other statements that are non-specific, cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature, other than historical facts included

being conducted, and is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do business
as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified, registered or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

5.2 Authority; Enforceability.

(a) The Buyer has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver the
Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by the Buyer
of the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party, and the

and validly authorized by the Buyer, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Buyer are necessary to authorize the Transaction Documents to

contemplated the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a party.

(b) The Transaction Documents to which the Buyer is, or will be, a party have
been (or will be, when executed and delivered at the Closing) duly executed
and delivered by the Buyer, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto, each Transaction Document to which the
Buyer is, or will be, a party constitutes (or will constitute, when executed
and delivered at the Closing) the valid and binding agreement of the Buyer,
enforceable against the Buyer in accordance with its terms.

5.3 Non-Contravention. Except as set forth on Section 5.3 of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents to which the Buyer is, or will be, a party by the Buyer

result in any breach of or violate or constitute a default (or an event that
with notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a default) under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
(with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Buyer
is a party or by which any property or asset of the 

Buyer is bound or affected; or (c) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 5.4, conflict with or violate any Law to which the
Buyer is subject or by which any of the Buyer's properties or assets is bound,
except, in the cases of clauses (b) and (c), for such defaults or rights of
termination, cancellation, amendment, or acceleration or violations as would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which the Buyer
is, or will be, a party or to materially impair the Buyer's ability to perform
its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is, or will be, a
party.

5.4 Governmental Approvals. No declaration, filing or registration with, or

and expenses of the Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the

otherwise amended or modified in any respect and (iii) no amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver of the Commitment Letter and no
withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification of the financing
commitments in the Commitment Letter is contemplated by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, any other party thereto. The
Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees in connection
with the Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the Execution Date
and shall in the future pay any such fees as they become due and payable.

(b) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including in any
fee letter between the Buyer and the Lenders or any of the Lenders' Affiliates
(the "Fee Letters")) other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letter, to the Lenders' obligations to fund the Financing. There are no side
letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (written or oral)

Letters) to which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party.

the Buyer or any other Affiliate of the Buyer shall be required to sell,
divest, convey or hold separate or otherwise take any other action (and the
Company will not undertake any such action without the Buyer's prior written
consent) that limits the Buyer's and its Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, particular products, assets or
businesses of the Buyer or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, and
(ii) none of the Buyer or any other Affiliate of the Buyer, or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to take or agree to take any action
with respect to its business or operations in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law.

(d) The Buyer and the Seller Parties shall cause their respective counsel to
furnish the other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions under the provisions of the HSR Act. The
Buyer and the Seller Parties shall cause their respective counsel to supply to
the other party copies of all correspondence, filings or written
communications by such party or its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority
or staff members thereof, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, except for the
Notification and Report Forms (and any attachments thereto) prepared and
submitted pursuant to the HSR Act or communications regarding the same, or
documents or information submitted in response to any request for additional
information or documents pursuant to the HSR Act which reveal any Party's
negotiating objectives, strategies or consideration expectations. The Parties
may provide such communications in a manner that protects any legally
applicable privilege. The Buyer and the Seller Parties (i) will promptly
notify each other of any written communication received from any Governmental
Authority pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) agree not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder unless it consults with the other in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the
opportunity to attend.

6.6 Environmental. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have, and
shall have caused its Subsidiaries to have, ceased all operations and vacated
the 22nd Avenue Property, including but not limited to (a) the removal,
decommissioning or disposal of all the items set forth on Section
4.13(a)(v)(C) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; and (b) the removal of all
personnel. 

6.7 Expenses. Other than the costs and expenses relating to (a) the HSR
filings and as set forth in Section 6.5, which shall be borne solely by the

brokerage or underwriting fees) for the RandW Policy, which shall be borne by
the Seller Parties and not exceed $1,063,750, and (c) the premium for the DandO
Tail Policy, any Transfer Taxes, and the items set forth on Schedule 6.7
(collectively, the "Shared Expenses"), all of which shall be shared 50/50 by
the Buyer and the Company, all costs and expenses incurred by the Seller
Parties in connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be included as Transaction Expenses hereunder, and
all costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer in connection with the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be paid
by the Buyer.

6.8 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

6.9 Public Statements. The Parties shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any press release, public announcement or other public disclosure with
respect to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby
and none of the Company, the Seller Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates, on one hand, nor the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, shall issue any press release or make any public announcement or
disclosure regarding the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby without the prior approval of the other Party; provided
that for the avoidance of doubt, such other Party for purposes of this Section
6.9 is the (a) Buyer, in the case of the Company, the Seller Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates and (b) Principal Seller, in the case of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public statement or disclosure shall first, to the extent
practicable, consult with the other Party about, and allow the other Party
reasonable time to comment in advance on, such press release, public
announcement, or disclosure; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
6.9 shall limit or restrict the Buyer or any of its Affiliates from making any
public statements or presentations in connection with industry conferences,
investor meetings, analyst meetings, analyst or investor conference calls, or
in response to questions from investors, analysts, press or other media and in
each case, that does not involve the disclosure of competitively sensitive
information.

6.10 Confidentiality. Each of the Seller Parties hereby agrees that it will
not, and that it will cause its Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officers, agents and representatives not to, at any time after the
Execution Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of
the Buyer, disclose or use any confidential or proprietary information of,
involving or relating to the Acquired Interests ("Confidential Information"),
other than in the performance of such Person's duties as an employee of, or
otherwise on behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that the information subject
to the foregoing provision of this sentence will not include any information
generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of
disclosure in violation hereof) or that was 

independently developed by such Seller Party without use or reference to
Confidential Information or was in its rightful possession before the
disclosure of the applicable Confidential Information to it; and provided,
further, that the provisions of this Section 6.10 will not prohibit any
retention of copies of records or disclosure (i) required by applicable Law so
long as, to the extent practicable, reasonable prior notice is given to the
Buyer of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to contest
the same or (ii) reasonably necessary and made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement.

6.11 Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions described in the Commitment Letter and Fee
Letters (or as may be amended or otherwise modified either with the prior
written consent of the Principal Seller or as permitted pursuant to this
Section 6.11), including (i) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
(the "Definitive Agreements") with respect to the Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and Fee
Letters (or as may be amended or otherwise modified either with the prior
written consent of the Principal Seller or as permitted pursuant to this
Section 6.11), (ii) to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions to
obtaining the Financing applicable to the Buyer set forth in the Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are within its reasonable control at
or prior to the Closing, (iii) to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Commitment Letter (or obtain the waiver of such
obligations), (iv) to consummate the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter at or prior to the Closing, including, in the event that all conditions
in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be
satisfied, by using reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders to fund the
full amount of the Financing (including by taking enforcement action to cause
such Lenders to fund the Financing) at the Closing and (v) to otherwise
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.

(b) The Buyer shall give the Principal Seller prompt notice upon becoming
aware of any material breach of any Commitment Letter by a party to such
Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter. The Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to keep the Principal Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing and any material developments relating to the
Financing and shall provide to the Principal Seller, upon reasonable request,
copies of the Definitive Agreements; provided that the Buyer may redact the
amount of any fee in any Fee Letter and subject to any confidentiality
limitation applicable to the Buyer. Further, the Buyer shall not agree to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement without the
Principal Seller's prior written consent, except that the Buyer may amend,
supplement or modify the Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement or
modification (i) does not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter, (ii) does not contain additional or modified
conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing in a manner
that would be reasonably expected to make it materially less likely that the
Financing would be funded than those contained in the Commitment Letter and
(iii) is otherwise not reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing;
provided, however, that the Buyer shall promptly notify the Principal Seller
in writing of any such amendment, supplement or 

other modification of, or waiver of any of its rights under, any Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Agreement.

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, and such cash portion is
required to fund any portion of the Closing Cash Purchase Price or any fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by the Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement, the Buyer shall notify the Principal Seller, and the Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments (other than
amounts that are replaced by the Buyer's cash on hand) from alternate sources
(such portion from alternate sources, the "Alternate Financing") on terms and
conditions that will enable the Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents; provided that such Alternate
Financing shall not (i) be subject to any additional or modified conditions or
other contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained in
the Commitment Letter in a manner that would be reasonably expected to make it
materially less likely that the Alternate Financing would be funded or (ii)
otherwise be reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing. The Buyer
shall deliver to the Principal Seller complete and correct copies of all
material amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant
to which any Alternate Financing shall be made available to the Buyer.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Seller Parties shall provide,
and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
representatives, including legal and accounting representatives, to provide,
at the Buyer's expense (subject to the reimbursement provisions below), in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, all reasonable cooperation
requested by the Buyer that is customary or necessary in connection with the
arrangement of debt financing for transactions that are substantially similar
to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (provided that
such requested cooperation does not (i) unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Seller Parties or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) cause any representation, warranty, covenant or other term in this
Agreement to be breached or (iii) cause any closing condition not to be
satisfied), including (A) participation in a reasonable number of
informational meetings in connection with the Financing, it being understood
and agreed that information and documents provided by the Company and the
Principal Seller or any other Seller Party may be delivered to agents and
lenders under the Commitment Letter and their representatives (subject to
customary arrangements for confidentiality that are substantially similar to
the provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement, including the Buyer providing
prior written notice of disclosure to the Company and the Principal Seller);
(B) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive
financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents, hedging
agreements and other certificates and the Definitive Agreements and other
documents as may be requested by the Buyer (including a certificate of the
chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters); (C)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing, including taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the Financing Sources of
the Financing to evaluate the Real Property and titled vehicles and current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures for
the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements and establishing, as of
the Closing, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and
lockbox arrangements in connection with the Financing; (D) using 

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, waivers, estoppels,
approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably requested by
the Buyer in connection with the Financing and collateral arrangements,
including Payoff Letters, lien releases, instruments of termination or
discharge, legal opinions, appraisals, engineering reports, surveys, title
insurance, landlord consents, waivers and access agreements; (E) furnishing
the Buyer with all documentation and other information related to the Seller
Parties and the Company and its Subsidiaries required by any Governmental
Authority under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the PATRIOT Act; and (F)
facilitating the consummation of the Financing, including cooperating with the
Buyer to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Financing to the extent
within the control of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and taking all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably
requested by the Buyer to permit the consummation of the Financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Buyer on the Closing
Date; provided that none of the Company, the Seller Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or
incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing
(other than the obligations set forth in this Agreement) or to take any action
that would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default of, or
breach under, or otherwise violate any Contract; provided, further, that
nothing in this Section 6.11 shall be construed as requiring the Company or
the Seller Parties to provide financial information other than the financial
information described in this Section 6.11. The Buyer shall promptly, upon
request by the Company or the Principal Seller, reimburse the Company or the
Seller Parties (as applicable) for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in good
faith by the Company or the Seller Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the cooperation of the Company or the Seller
Parties and their respective Affiliates contemplated by this Section 6.11 and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Seller Parties and their
respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any
information prepared or provided by the Company or any of the Seller Parties
or any of their respective representatives or to the extent such Losses result
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of the
Seller Parties. The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in
connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.11, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and therein are not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Financing or receipt
of the proceeds therefrom. For purposes of this Section 6.11(e) the term
"Financing" shall also be deemed to include any Alternate Financing and the
term "Commitment Letter" shall also be deemed to include any commitment letter
(or similar agreement) with respect to such Alternate Financing. 

6.12 Employee Matters.

(a) Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the date that is 12
months following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall provide or cause to be
provided to each Employee, compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries during such period;
provided, however, that the Buyer shall have no obligation to provide equity
grants to the Employees.

(b) For a period of 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not
terminate the employment of any Employee other than due to a termination for
cause as determined in good faith by the Buyer, and, following such 60-day
period, each Employee shall be offered severance in accordance with the
Buyer's existing employment policies.

(c) As of the Closing Date, all Employees shall be eligible to participate in
and, if elected, shall commence participation in each of the welfare benefit
plans of the Buyer (the "Buyer Benefit Plans") to the extent coverage under
such Buyer Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
Benefit Program in which such Employee participated immediately before the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall (i) to the extent within the Buyer's control and
ability under any Buyer Benefit Plan waive, or use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any third-party insurance carriers to waive, all limitations
as to pre-existing condition exclusions, active employment requirements,
requirements to show evidence of good health and waiting periods with respect
to Employees and their spouses and dependents, if applicable, to the same
extent waived under a similar or comparable Benefit Program in which such
Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date and (ii) cause each
Buyer Benefit Plan to provide, to the extent within the Buyer's control and
ability under any Buyer Benefit Plan, or use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any third-party insurance carriers to provide, each Employee with
credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any deductible requirements or out of pocket limits under the Buyer
Benefit Plans for the plan year in which participation in such Buyer Benefit
Plan occurs.

(d) The Buyer shall cause to be provided to each Employee credit for prior
service with the Company or its Affiliates to the extent such service would be
recognized if it had been performed as an employee of the Buyer or its
Affiliates for all purposes (including for vesting, eligibility and benefit
accrual) in each vacation, severance or other paid-time off plan or program of
the Buyer in which such Employees are eligible to participate after the
Closing Date to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the
Closing Date, to credit for such service under the corresponding Benefit
Program; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

(e) The Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Employee identified in
Section 6.12(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Section 6.12(e)
Employee") three separate cash bonuses in the amounts set forth therein, less
applicable tax withholdings (each, a "Retention Bonus"). The first Retention
Bonus shall be paid on the first regular Company payroll date that follows or
is coincident with the Closing Date, the second Retention Bonus shall be paid
on the first regular Company payroll date that follows or is coincident with
the first anniversary of 

the Closing Date, and the third Retention Bonus shall be paid on the first
regular Company payroll date that follows or is coincident with the second
anniversary of the Closing Date. Each Retention Bonus shall be paid only if
the applicable Section 6.12(e) Employee remains employed by the Company or one
of its Affiliates (including following the Closing, Buyer or one of its
Affiliates) through the date the Retention Bonus is paid; provided, that in
the event that following the Closing a Section 6.12(e) Employee's employment
is terminated by the Company or one of its Affiliates without Cause (as
defined below), and the Section 6.12(e) Employee has executed and not revoked
within the applicable revocation period a valid release agreement in a form
reasonable acceptable to the Buyer, such Section 6.12(e) Employee shall be
entitled to receive each unpaid Retention Bonus, payable upon the later of (i)
the date such Retention Bonus otherwise would have been paid under this
Section 6.12(e) and (ii) the 60th day after such termination of employment.
For purposes of the Retention Bonuses "Cause" shall have the meaning assigned
such term in any individual agreement between such Section 6.12(e) Employee
and the Company as in effect on the Execution Date, or if no such individual
agreement exists, "Cause" shall mean the Section 6.12(e) Employee's (i) gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the course of his employment that is or
could reasonably be expected to be materially injurious to the Company or any
of its Affiliates, (ii) willful failure or refusal to perform in any material
respect his duties or responsibilities to the Company or its Affiliates, (iii)
misappropriation of any assets of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iv)
commission of embezzlement or fraud by his own action, or at his direction,
(v) conviction of, or pleading "guilty" or "no contest" to, a felony under
state or federal law, or (vi) habitual drug or alcohol abuse subject to any
reasonable accommodation, if any, that is required to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

(f) The Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Employee identified in
Section 6.12(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Section 6.12(f)
Employee") a cash bonus in the amount set forth therein, less applicable tax
withholdings (each, a "Deal Bonus"). Each Deal Bonus shall be paid on the
first regular Company payroll date that follows or is coincident with the 45th
day following the Closing Date only if the applicable Section 6.12(f) Employee
remains employed by the Company or one of its Affiliates (including following
the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates) through the date the Deal Bonus
is paid; provided, however, that the proviso in Section 6.12(e) regarding the
obligations to pay the Retention Bonus following a termination without Cause
shall apply mutatis mutandis to a Section 6.12(f) Employee with respect to a
Deal Bonus.

(g) On the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Company to pay to each
Employee identified in Section 6.12(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in
addition to any Retention Bonus payable to such employee, a lump sum cash
bonus in the amount set forth therein, less applicable tax withholdings;
provided that, the Employee remains employed by the Company or one of its
Affiliates through the Closing Date.

(h) The Parties acknowledge and agree that no provision of this Agreement
shall be construed to: (i) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (ii) except as set forth in Sections 6.12(e), 6.12(f) and
6.12(g) create any right to any compensation or benefits whatsoever on the
part of any Employee or other future, present or former employee of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates, the Buyer, or its Affiliates; (iii)
guarantee employment for any period of time or, except 

as set forth in Section 6.12(b), preclude the ability of the Buyer to
terminate any employee, independent contractor or Employee for any reason at
any time; (iv) require the Buyer to continue any Buyer Benefit Plan or Benefit
Program, or other employee compensation or benefit plans or arrangements, or
prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing
Date; or (v) constitute an amendment to any Benefit Program, Buyer Benefit
Plan, or other employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement.

6.13 Reserved.

6.14 No Shop. Except as set forth in Section 6.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Seller Parties and
the Company shall not, and shall not permit their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, (a) discuss, encourage,
negotiate, undertake, initiate, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into,
any business combination transaction, whether by way of merger, consolidation,
business combination, purchase or disposition of assets or equity interests of
the Company or otherwise, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (b) facilitate, encourage, solicit
or initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (c) furnish or cause to be furnished,
to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties
or assets of the Company in connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (d)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing. Except as set forth in Section 6.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, commencing on the Execution Date, each Seller Party shall, and shall
cause the Company and their Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives and agents to, (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than the Buyer) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction, (ii) except to the extent prohibited
by a confidentiality obligation owed to a Person, notify the Buyer orally and
in writing promptly (but in no event later than two Business Days) after
receipt of any proposal or offer from any Person other than the Buyer to
effect an Acquisition Transaction or any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of
the Company by any Person other than the Buyer (such notice shall indicate the
material terms of any such proposal or offer, or modification or amendment to
such proposal or offer) and (iii) to the extent not previously requested,
request the return or destruction of any confidential written or electronic
materials provided to any Person in connection with a contemplated or
potential Acquisition Transaction.

6.15 Management Compensation. The Buyer shall make available at Closing, a
sufficient number of restricted shares of Buyer Common Stock and/or options
for shares of Buyer Common Stock, which shall be issued to the Company's
management under the Buyer's Equity and Incentive Award Plan.

6.16 Charter Provisions Regarding Indemnification.

(a) The Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or
former managers, directors, 

officers, members, employees, agents and fiduciaries of the Company
(collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") as provided as of the Execution Date
in the Organizational Documents of the Company shall survive the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years from the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including
the Company after the Closing) not to, repeal such arrangements in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights of the Company Indemnitees thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.14 in connection with (i) any
matter as to which any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to ARTICLE IX or (ii) any action, claim or dispute between or among
the Seller Parties.

(b) In the event the Buyer or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the
Company or such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or such
transferee, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.16.

(c) The obligations of the Buyer under this Section 6.16 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.16 applies without the consent of such
Company Indemnitee so adversely affected.

6.17 DandO Tail Policy. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company or the Principal
Seller shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under their
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for their
directors and officers, which will provide such directors and officers with
coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable
to, the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company or the Principal Seller;
provided that in no event shall the Company or the Principal Seller expend in
excess of $50,000 (the "DandO Tail Policy").

6.18 Tax Matters.

(a) With respect to each Tax Return related to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date that is required to be filed after the Closing Date by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, the Principal Seller shall (i)
cause such Tax Return to be prepared on a basis that is consistent with
Section 6.18(e) and the manner in which the Seller Parties prepared and/or
filed such Tax Returns for prior periods except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law, (ii) cause to be included in such Tax Return all
Tax Items required to be included therein and (iii) not later than five days
prior to the due date for such Tax Return, deliver such Tax Return, along with
the excess of (A) any amount required to be paid by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company with respect to such Tax Return over (B) the amount
of such Taxes taken into account as a Current Liability in the final
determination of the Working Capital, to the Company or the appropriate
Subsidiary for timely filing with the appropriate Governmental Authority. 

(b) With respect to each Tax Return related to a Straddle Period (as defined
below) that is required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, the Buyer shall (i) cause such Tax
Return to be prepared on a basis that is consistent with Section 6.18(e) and
the manner in which the Seller Parties prepared and/or filed such Tax Returns
for prior periods except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law
and (ii) cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax Items required to be
included therein. Reasonably in advance of the due date for filing any such
Tax Return, the Buyer shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return, together with
all supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Principal Seller for its
review and reasonable comment and the Buyer shall incorporate any such
comments subject to the Buyer's approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). The Buyer will cause such Tax
Return (as revised to incorporate the Principal Seller's approved comments) to
be filed timely with the appropriate Governmental Authority and will provide a
copy thereof to the Principal Seller. Within five days of delivery by the
Buyer to the Principal Seller of a copy of such Tax Return (but not earlier
than two Business Days prior to the date of such Tax Return) together with a
schedule setting forth an allocation of Taxes due in connection with filing
such Tax Return between the Pre-Closing Taxable Period and the Post-Closing
Taxable Period, the Principal Seller shall pay to the Buyer the excess of (A)
an amount equal to all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return that are
attributable to the Pre-Closing Taxable Period over (B) the amount of such
Taxes taken into account as a Current Liability in the final determination of
the Working Capital.

(c) If, for any United States federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes,
the taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not
terminate on the Closing Date (any such period, a "Straddle Period"), Taxes,
if any, attributable to such Straddle Period shall be allocated in the
following manner. For allocations of income or deductions required to
determine any income Taxes, sales and use Taxes, payroll Taxes or other
transactional Taxes for a Straddle Period, such allocation shall be made by
means of a closing of the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of all Taxes other than
income Taxes, sales and use Taxes, payroll Taxes or other transactional Taxes
in respect of the Straddle Period shall be allocated between the period ending
on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of days for
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, on the
other hand. For purposes of this paragraph, exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily basis. Any franchise Tax or
other Tax providing the right to do business for a specified period shall be
allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the
right to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such
Tax.

(d) The Seller Parties, the Buyer, the Company and each of their respective
Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in contesting or defending against any audit,
litigation or other claim for Taxes (each, a "Tax Proceeding") imposed on or
with respect to the assets, operations or activities of the Company or any
Subsidiary relating to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or Straddle Period. Such

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION RIGHTS

8.1 Termination Rights. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing as follows:

(a) By mutual written consent of the Principal Seller and the Buyer;

(b) By either the Principal Seller or the Buyer if any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and non-appealable order,
decree or judgment prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) By either the Principal Seller or the Buyer in the event that the Closing
has not occurred on or prior to July 31, 2017 (the "Termination Date");
provided, however, that (i) the Principal Seller may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if such failure of the Closing to
occur is due to the failure of any of the Seller Parties' to perform and
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be
performed or complied with by the Seller Parties and (ii) the Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if such failure of
the Closing to occur is due to the failure of the Buyer to perform and comply
in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be performed or
complied with by the Buyer;

(d) By the Buyer if there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy of the Seller
Parties' or the Company's representations and warranties in this Agreement or
a failure by the Company or the Seller Parties to perform their respective
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, in any such case in a manner that
would result in, if occurring and continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(c), unless
such failure is reasonably capable of being cured by the Termination Date, in
which case, so long as the Company or the Seller Parties, as applicable, are
using commercially reasonable efforts to cure such failure, the Company or the
Seller Parties, as applicable, shall have 30 days (but in no event beyond the
Termination Date) after receipt of notice from the Buyer of its intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) to cure such failure
before the Buyer may so terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to 

this Section 8.1(d) if (i) any of the Buyer's representations and warranties
shall have become and continue to be untrue in a manner that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) not to be satisfied or (ii) there has
been, and continues to be, a failure by the Buyer to perform its covenants and
agreements in such a manner as would cause the condition set forth in Section
7.3(b) not to be satisfied;

(e) By the Principal Seller if there shall have been a breach or inaccuracy of
the Buyer's representations and warranties in this Agreement or a failure by
the Buyer to perform its covenants and agreements in this Agreement, in any
such case in a manner that would result in, if occurring and continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), unless such failure is reasonably capable of being
cured by the Termination Date, in which case, so long as the Buyer is using
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such failure, the Buyer shall have 30
days (but in no event beyond the Termination Date) after receipt of notice
from the Principal Seller of its intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) to cure such failure before the Principal
Seller may so terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the Principal
Seller may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if (i)
any of the Seller Parties' or the Company's representations and warranties
shall have become and continue to be untrue in a manner that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be satisfied or (ii) there has
been, and continues to be, a failure by the Seller Parties to perform their
covenants and agreements in such a manner as would cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(c) not to be satisfied; or

(f) By the Principal Seller, at any time subsequent to the date upon which the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.3, if (i) the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VII have been satisfied, or to the extent permitted,
waived (other than conditions by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing); (ii) the Principal Seller and the Company have indicated in
writing to the Buyer that all closing deliverables set forth in Sections
2.4(b) and 2.4(c) to be delivered by the Principal Seller and the Company to
the Buyer at Closing will be so delivered and that the Seller Parties and the
Company are ready, willing and able to proceed with the Closing (such notice,
the "Satisfaction Notice"); provided that the Satisfaction Notice shall not
constitute a waiver of any requirement that any condition be satisfied or
waived at or prior to the Closing; and (iii) the Buyer shall have failed to
consummate the Closing by the close of business on the fifth Business Day
following the Buyer's receipt of the Satisfaction Notice by reason of a
failure of the consummation of the Financing.

(g) Any Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other Parties to this
Agreement.

8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
all rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall
terminate, except for the provisions of this Section 8.2, ARTICLE X and
Sections 6.7, 11.1, 11.3, 11.6, 11.8, 11.9 and 11.13; provided, however, that
in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1(d),
8.1(e) or 8.1(f), nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability
for any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by such Party or for
Fraud by such Party and all rights and remedies of a 

non-breaching Party under this Agreement in the case of any such willful and
intentional breach or Fraud, at law and in equity, shall be preserved,
including the right to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. Except
to the extent otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence or as
provided in Section 8.2(b) below, the Parties agree that, if this Agreement is
terminated, the Parties shall have no liability to each other under or
relating to this Agreement.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Principal Seller pursuant
to Section 8.1(f), then the Buyer shall, pay or cause to be paid to the
Company a termination fee in immediately available funds in the amount of
$21,000,000 (any such termination fee hereinafter referred to as the
"Termination Fee"). The Buyer shall not be required to pay a termination fee
to the Company in any circumstances other than as described in the immediately
preceding sentence. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer's payment
of the Termination Fee will be considered liquidated damages and in the event
of such payment, neither the Buyer, nor any Financing Source shall have any
other liability for any breach by it of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, except in the
case of Fraud. Except in the case of Fraud, if the Termination Fee (x) is paid
or (y) all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those
conditions which by their terms are only capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, and the
proximate cause of the failure of the Closing to occur is the failure of the
consummation of the Financing, (i) it shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Seller Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries against the Buyer and
any of its respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees or potential financing sources (including the Financing Sources) or
their respective Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Parties") with respect
to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Financing); and (ii) in no event
will the Company or any of the Seller Parties seek, or have the right, to
recover any other money damages or seek, or have the right to, any other
remedy (including specific performance under Section 10.5) from any Buyer
Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Buyer's failure to secure
the Financing, regardless of whether such monetary damages or other remedies
are based on a claim in law or equity, and all such claims are hereby waived.

directors, officers, employees, consultants, representative, agents and

that the limitation set forth in this Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to
Losses arising from any breach or inaccuracy of any Buyer Fundamental
Representation.

(c) Cap.

(i) Other than in the case of Fraud, the Seller Parties' liability under this
ARTICLE IX shall not exceed and shall be satisfied solely from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (the "Cap"); provided that the limitation set
forth in this Section 9.3(c)(i) shall not apply to (A) Losses arising from any

aggregate liability arising under this ARTICLE IX exceed the sum of 

$135,000,000 plus the market value of the Specified Buyer Common Stock as of
the market close on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

(d) Survival; Claims Period.

(i) The representations and warranties of the Parties under this Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date
other than the Seller Fundamental Representations, the Company Fundamental
Representations (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.17), the Buyer Fundamental Representations, and the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.13 and Section 4.17, in each case, which
will survive for the applicable statute of limitations period (the date, if
any, on which a representation or warranty contained herein so expires, the
"Expiration Date").

(ii) Any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement (whether in
respect of pre-Closing or post-Closing period) shall survive until fully
discharged.

(iii) No indemnifying Party shall have any liability for indemnification
claims made under this ARTICLE IX with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty unless a Claim Notice in respect of such claim is
timely given in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date. If a Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance with
this Agreement on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date, then the
applicable representation or warranty shall survive as to such Claim until
such Claim has been finally resolved.

(e) Calculation of Losses. In calculating amounts payable to any Seller
Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee (each such person, an "Indemnified Party") for
a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses
shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made and shall be computed net of (i) payments
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy (other
than the RandW Policy) with respect to such Losses (provided, however, that (A)
the amount of any such payments shall be adjusted to account for the cost
incurred by an Indemnified Party for increased insurance premiums (other than
in connection with the RandW Policy) and (B) nothing contained herein or
otherwise shall create any obligation on the part of any Indemnified Party to
pursue any insurance recovery with respect to any Losses); and (ii) any prior
or subsequent actual recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person with
respect to such Losses (provided, however, that nothing contained herein or
otherwise shall create any obligation on the part of any Indemnified Party to
pursue any such recovery with respect to any Losses). The amount payable to an
Indemnified Party shall be reduced by (x) any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses (net of
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such payments) and (y)
indemnification or reimbursement payments actually received by the Indemnified
Party from third parties with respect to such Losses (net of reasonable out of
pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such payments). 

(f) Recovery. In the event that any Losses are suffered by any one or more
Indemnified Parties for which any such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this ARTICLE IX and any such Indemnified Party is
indemnified by an indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, then such
Losses shall be deemed to have been fully satisfied and shall no longer exist
and, therefore, any further recovery by such Indemnified Party or any other
Indemnified Party from any indemnifying Party for such same Losses would
constitute an unintended "double" recovery and shall be prohibited under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.3(f) is intended solely
to preclude "double"' recovery for such same Losses, and nothing contained
herein shall be construed to preclude recovery for different Losses caused or
deemed to be caused by the same event or similar Losses incurred by multiple
Indemnitees.

(g) Waiver.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Party be liable for punitive, special, incidental, indirect, consequential
or lost profits damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of
action through which such damages are sought, except for any such damages
recovered by any third party against an indemnified Party in respect of which
such indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to the terms hereof.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
representative or Affiliate of any Party (or any representative of any such
Affiliate) in such capacity shall have any personal liability to any Party as
a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Each Party hereby waives, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to
waive, any claims or other method of recovery, whether based in contract, tort
or strict liability, or under applicable Law, against any such representative
or Affiliate relating to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

(iii) Effective as of the Closing, White Deer hereby forever releases and
discharges the Company, and the Company hereby forever releases and discharges
White Deer, from the claims, demands, causes of action, Losses or liabilities
arising prior to the Closing. Except as expressly provided in this Section
9.3(g), White Deer and the Company understands and agrees that this Section
9.3(g) shall not impair or otherwise adversely affect any other claims whether
related to any period prior to the Closing Date or otherwise.

(h) Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Escrow.

(i) The remedies provided in this ARTICLE IX shall be the sole and exclusive
legal remedies of the Parties, from and after the Closing, with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the
remedies set forth in the letter agreement dated as of the Execution Date
between the Principal Seller and the Buyer.

(ii) Any indemnity amounts paid to a Buyer Indemnitee in accordance with this
ARTICLE IX shall be paid first from the funds in the Indemnification Escrow 

Account by delivery of joint written instructions from the Principal Seller
and the Buyer to the Escrow Agent to pay to such Buyer Indemnitee an amount
equal to the lesser of (A) the amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Account (without taking into account such release) and (B) the amount of such
Claim submitted by the Buyer in accordance with this ARTICLE IX. Any amounts
payable to a Buyer Indemnitee in excess of the amount remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account (without taking into account such release) may
be satisfied in cash or in Specified Buyer Common Stock, which shall have a
market value measured as of the market close on the Business Day immediately
preceding the date of final and conclusive settlement of the applicable claim;
provided, that any amounts payable under the CVR Agreement shall be adjusted
to reflect the reduced number of shares of Specified Buyer Common Stock held
by the applicable Seller Party after satisfaction of such claim.

(iii) On the Escrow Release Date, the Buyer and the Principal Seller shall
prepare and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release all funds, if any held in the
Indemnification Escrow Account held by the Escrow Agent less the aggregated
amount of all Losses specified in any then-unresolved good faith claims for
indemnification made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement to the Seller Parties.

9.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE IX,
such Indemnitee must assert its claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE
IX (each, a "Claim") by providing a written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
indemnifying Party allegedly required to provide indemnification protection
under this ARTICLE IX specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis
for such Claim (e.g., the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement alleged to have been breached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnitee's failure to send or delay in sending a Claim Notice will not
relieve the indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to such
Claim except to the extent the indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay and except as is otherwise provided herein, including in
Section 9.3(d).

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third party Claim for which, by the
terms hereof, an indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee,
the indemnifying Party will have the right, at such indemnifying Party's
expense, to assume the defense of same (so long as prior to assuming the
defense of same, such indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified Party in writing) including the appointment and
selection of counsel on behalf of the Indemnitee so long as such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that in the event
of the assertion of any third party Claim by a customer or supplier of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for which, by the terms hereof, an indemnifying
Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee, the indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of same, but rather the Indemnitee
shall control the defense (although the indemnifying Party will have
reasonable information and consultation rights in connection therewith and the
Indemnitee not shall settle such Claim without the other indemnifying Party's
prior consent, such 

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such third party Claim,
it shall within 30 days notify the Indemnitee in writing of its intent to do
so. The indemnifying Party will have the right to settle or compromise or take
any corrective or remediation action with respect to any such Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by
the indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of
the indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will be entitled, at its own cost, to
participate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim. If
the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third-party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute such Claim, or if the indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnitee may assume control of
such defense and in the event it is finally determined pursuant to the
procedures set forth in ARTICLE X that the Claim was a matter for which the
indemnifying Party is required to provide indemnification under the terms of
this ARTICLE IX, the indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable costs and
expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses).
The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other party reasonably
apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement
negotiations with respect thereto. If any Indemnitee desires to participate
in, but not control, any such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole
cost and expense.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnitee to any criminal liability,
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnitee or
imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the
Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's prior written consent.

(d) Any indemnity payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Cash Purchase Price unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

9.5 Materiality. For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, any failure of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement to be true and correct
and any Losses arising out of or resulting from such failure shall be
determined without giving effect to any qualifications regarding materiality,
the use of the word "material" in the definitions of "Company Material Adverse
Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty (but shall give
effect to qualifications regarding Knowledge).

9.6 No Reliance.

(a) THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE III AND OF THE COMPANY CONTAINED IN ARTICLE IV CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES AND THE COMPANY
TO THE BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS

OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER MADE BY SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF
ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF, OR ANY PERSON'S RELIANCE ON,
ANY INFORMATION, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER DOCUMENT OR OTHER MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE
TO BUYER IN ANY DATA ROOM, ELECTRONIC DATA ROOM, MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION OR IN
ANY OTHER FORM IN EXPECTATION OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT). EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT, OR INFORMATION
MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR
ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING OPINIONS, INFORMATION, PROJECTIONS, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR
MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY PARTY OR ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE, AGENT OR
REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES).

(b) No Party nor any Affiliate of a Party shall assert or threaten, and each
Party hereby waives and shall cause such Affiliates to waive, any claim or
other method of recovery, in contract, in tort or under applicable Law,
against any Person that is not a Party (or a successor to a Party) relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

10.1 Sole and Exclusive Method for Resolution of Disputes. Any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents shall
be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this ARTICLE X,
which shall be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of any
such disputes.

10.2 Negotiation Between Executives. The Parties involved in the dispute shall
attempt to resolve the dispute between them promptly by negotiation between
executives who have authority to settle the controversy and who are at a
comparable or higher level of management than the persons who have been
involved in the negotiation of this Agreement. Any Party may give the other
Parties written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of
business; provided, however, that the requirements under this Section 10.2
shall fall away if there has been no resolution within 60 days after the
delivery of the initial notice. Within 7 days after delivery of such notice,
the receiving Party or Parties shall submit to the other a written response.
The notice and response shall include (a) a statement of that Party's position
and a summary of the arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and
title of the executive who will represent that Party and of any other person
who will accompany the executive. Within 15 days after delivery of the initial
notice, the executives of the Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time
and place, and thereafter continue to meet 

as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to use their good faith and
reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute. All negotiations
pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be treated as
compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of
evidence, and any documents or information exchanged pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be returned immediately following the earlier of the conclusion
of negotiations or the institution of litigation.

10.3 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (a) the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (b) any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought by it
except in such courts). The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and
agree not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in (i) the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (ii) any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
state or federal court within the State of Delaware) or that any such
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each of the Parties also agrees that any final and non-appealable
judgment against a Party in connection with any Proceeding shall be conclusive
and binding on such Party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United
States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

10.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR TO DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

10.5 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary
damages, except as otherwise provided by Section 8.2(b) each of the Parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement exclusively in the jurisdiction provided in Section 10.3 and all
such rights and remedies at law or in equity may be cumulative, except as may
be limited by ARTICLE IX and the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein (other than as set forth in Section 8.2(b) of this
Agreement), it is explicitly agreed that the Seller Parties shall be entitled
to seek specific performance of the Buyer's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement only in the event that (a) all
conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those not satisfied primarily
due to the Buyer's failure to have performed its obligations under this
Agreement) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (or, with
respect to certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of being
satisfied upon the Closing) at the time when the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to Section 2.3; (b) all of the 

conditions to the consummation of the Financing have been satisfied (or, with
respect to certificates to be delivered at the consummation of the Financing,
are capable of being satisfied upon consummation) and the Financing is ready
to be funded at the Closing; and (c) the Principal Seller has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded,
then the Closing pursuant to ARTICLE II will occur. The Parties further agree
that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.5 and each Party waives any objection to the
imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
provided, however, that (a) the Buyer may assign any of its rights or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Parties to any Subsidiary (including the Company from and after

assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties to a member
of the Principal Seller in connection with the distribution (the "Permitted
Distribution") of the Specified Buyer Common Stock received by such Seller
Party at the Closing to such member (provided that (i) Specified Buyer Common
Stock received by the Seller Parties at the Closing shall not be distributed
to more than 10 Persons, (ii) such Permitted Distribution may only be effected
if consummated immediately following the Closing, (iii) each recipient of
Specified Buyer Common Stock in connection with a Permitted Distribution shall
be, and shall provide the Buyer with certification that (A) the recipient 

is an "accredited investor" and by reason of its own business and financial
experience, the recipient has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in
business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of their respective investments in the Specified Buyer Common Stock
and has the capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the
Specified Buyer Common Stock and is able to bear the economic risk of such
investment and (B) the recipient is not a "benefit plan investor" (as such
term is defined in Section 3(423) of ERISA) and the recipient represents that

constitute a prohibited transaction under Code Section 4975 or ERISA Section
406, (iv) a proportional amount of the rights under the CVR Agreement in

the Permitted Distribution shall be transferred to the applicable recipient of
the Permitted Distribution, it being understood and agreed that the rights of
the Seller Parties under the CVR Agreement shall not be transferrable except
in connection with a Permitted Distribution and subject to the requirements
set forth in the CVR Agreement (v) the Seller Parties will consult with the
Buyer and cooperate with its reasonable requests in connection with the
structuring and execution of the Permitted Distribution, including by
providing reasonably requested information about the recipient of any
Permitted Distribution , (vi) the recipient and the Seller Party comply with
the terms and conditions of the Company\'s transfer agent and registrar,
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company and (vii) each recipient of
Specified Buyer Common Stock in connection with a Permitted Distribution will
sign a lock-up agreement in substantially the same form as the Lock-Up
Agreement). Prior to effecting any Permitted Distribution, the Seller Parties
shall deliver to the Buyer an agreement, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer, whereby each recipient of Specified Buyer Common Stock in
connection with such Permitted Distribution agrees to satisfy such Person's
pro rata portion of any indemnification obligations of the Seller Parties
under this Agreement, and the Buyer shall be an express third party
beneficiary of such agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Buyer and, from and
after the Closing, the Company may assign any of their respective rights under
the Transaction Documents by way of security to any banks or holders of debt
securities or financial institutions or hedge counterparties or any other
Person, including the Financing Sources (collectively, the "Financiers"),
lending money, providing credit or otherwise providing financing to any of the
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, including any
Financiers in connection with any and all subsequent re-financings. Any

pursuant to Section 6.15). Except as provided by the foregoing sentence, (x)
none of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or
enforceable by any third party, including any creditor of any Party or any of
their Affiliates, and (y) no such third party shall obtain any right under any
provision of this Agreement or shall by reasons of any such provision make any
claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise) against any other Party.

11.6 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, 

WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OR PRINCIPLES THAT
MIGHT REFER THE GOVERNANCE OR CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE LAW OF
ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

11.7 Entire Agreement. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the execution of this Agreement, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, among the Parties or
between any of them with respect to such subject matter.

11.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction, (a)
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction; and (b) the
Parties shall promptly amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
such provision contained herein that is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law to the intent of the Parties.

has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each Party
and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be construed
against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the Parties waive
the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

11.10 Disclosure Schedules. The inclusion of any information (including dollar
amounts) in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment
by the Seller Parties or the Buyer, as applicable that such information is
required to be listed on such section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as applicable or is material to or outside the
ordinary course of the business of the Seller Parties or the Company, on the
one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand. The information contained in this
Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits

Person of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of a legal
requirement or breach of contract).

facsimile or PDF signatures by any Party and such signature shall be deemed
binding for all purposes hereof, without delivery of an original signature
being thereafter required. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. 

11.12 Reserved.

11.13 Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement:

Affiliates, any dispute related to, or arising from, the Financing, the
Commitment Letter, the Fee Letters or the performance thereof, (ii) waive any
rights or claims that they may have against any Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement and, in the case of the Company, the Seller Parties and
their respective Affiliates, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letters, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
(iii) agree not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss or otherwise
terminate, and not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, in the case of the Company, the Seller
Parties and their respective Affiliates, the Financing, the Commitment Letter,
the Fee Letters or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(b) With respect to any dispute or proceeding against any Financing Source
relating to this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the parties
hereto, on behalf of themselves and their related parties, (i) submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York or federal
courts of the United States of America, in each case, sitting in the Borough
of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof (the courts described
in this clause (i), the "Applicable Courts"), and agree that all claims in
respect of any such litigation may be heard and determined only in the
Applicable Courts, (ii) waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
proceeding in any Applicable Court, (iii) waive, to the fullest extent

(c) Each Party hereto agrees that each Financing Source (i) shall be an
intended third party beneficiary of (A) each of the provisions of Section 10.4
and this Section 11.13 and (B) each of the other provisions of this Agreement
providing for a liability cap or other limitation on remedies and damages and
(ii) shall be entitled to rely on and enforce any and all such provisions.

any related definitions used in such provisions may be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, in a

individual who satisfies the Director Requirements.

(e) For so long as a Holder is entitled to designate any individuals to the
Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2.01, the Company shall take all
action reasonably available to it to cause such individual(s) (or any
replacement designated by such Holder) to be included in the slate of nominees
recommended by the Board of Directors to the Company's stockholders for
election as directors at each annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (and/or in connection with any election by written consent) and the
Company shall use the same efforts to cause the election of such nominee(s) as
it uses to cause other nominees recommended

|

10 

by the Board of Directors to be elected, including soliciting proxies in favor
of the election of such nominee(s).

(f) Until immediately prior to the time at which Investor Holdco ceases to
collectively have beneficial ownership of at least 50% of the aggregate number
of Company Shares then outstanding, Investor Holdco shall vote its Company
Shares to set the size of the Board of Directors at 11 individuals. For so
long as Investor Holdco has beneficial ownership of less than 50% but at least
35% of the aggregate number of Company Shares then outstanding, Investor
Holdco shall, unless otherwise determined by the management board of Investor
Holdco in accordance with the operating agreement of Investor Holdco, cause
its individuals designated to the Board of Directors to vote in favor of
maintaining the size of the Board of Directors at 11 individuals.

(g) In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the death,
disability, retirement, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of a
director nominated or designated pursuant to this Section 2.01, or in the
event of the failure of any such nominee to be elected, the Holder who
nominated or designated such director shall have the right to designate a
replacement who satisfies the Director Requirements to fill such vacancy. The
Company shall take all action reasonably available to it to cause such vacancy
to be filled by the replacement so designated, and, to the extent permitted
under the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company then in
effect, the Board of Directors shall promptly elect such designee to the Board
of Directors.

(h) As of and after the Effective Date, each of the Cerberus Representative,
Trican and the Keane Representative, acting on behalf of the Keane Parties
beneficially owning (directly or through Investor Holdco) in excess of 50% of
the Company Shares then beneficially owned (directly or through Investor
Holdco) by the Keane Parties, respectively, shall be entitled to, at its
option, designate up to two individuals in the capacity of non-voting
observers (each, an "Observer") to the Board of Directors. As of and after the
Effective Date, RockPile Holdco shall be entitled to at its option (i)
designate one individual in the capacity of Observer to the Board of Directors
or (ii) assign its right to designate an Observer to the Board of Directors to
the White Deer Holder in connection with a distribution of Company Shares by
RockPile Holdco to the White Deer Holder. The appointment and removal of any
Observer shall be by written notice to the Board of Directors.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, following the Effective Date:
(A) if the Keane Parties as a group, directly or indirectly though Investor
Holdco, cease to beneficially own at least 50% of the Company Shares
beneficially owned by the Keane Parties as of the Effective Date, the Keane
Parties shall no longer have any right to appoint Observers under Section
2.01(h) and shall cause such individuals designated by them to immediately
resign; (B) if Trican, directly or indirectly though Investor Holdco, ceases
to beneficially own at least 25% of the Company Shares beneficially owned by
Trican as of the Effective Date, Trican shall no longer have any right to
appoint Observers under Section 2.01(h) and shall cause such individuals
designated by them to immediately resign; and (C) upon the earlier of (i) the
RockPile Holders ceasing to beneficially own at least 50% of the Company
Shares beneficially owned by RockPile Holders as of the Effective Date and
(ii) an Observer Termination Event, RockPile Holdco or the White Deer Holder,
as applicable, shall no longer have any right to


 

--- 
| | 

|

11 

appoint Observers under Section 2.01(g) and shall cause such individuals
designated by them to immediately resign. RockPile Holdco or the White Deer
Holder, as applicable, shall provide prior written notice to the Company of
any event that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, an
Observer Termination Event.

(j) An Observer may attend any meeting of the Board of Directors, provided,
that no Observer shall have the right to vote or otherwise participate in the
Board of Directors meeting in any way other than to observe any applicable
meeting of the Board of Directors. Observers shall be provided advance notice
of each meeting of the Board of Directors in the same manner and at the same
time as the other members of the Board of Directors and shall be given copies
of all documents, materials and other information as and when given to other
members of the Board of Directors, provided that the Observer shall have
executed a non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement and such other
acknowledgments and agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Board of
Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Observer shall be excluded from
attending any meeting of the Board of Directors or receiving any materials to
the extent necessary to preserve attorney-client privilege, to safeguard
highly proprietary or classified information, in the case of any conflict of
interest involving such Observer or as otherwise deemed necessary or advisable
by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors or any committee thereof
shall have the right to exclude an Observer from any meeting or portion
thereof in the sole discretion of a majority of the members in attendance at
such meeting. Each Observer shall be a natural person.

Section 2.02. Voting.

(a) Prior to the distribution by Investor Holdco of all (but not less than
all) of its Registrable Securities to its members, each member of Investor
Holdco and their respective Permitted Assignees (including recipients of
Registrable Securities from Investor Holdco pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.03) agrees, with respect to all of such Person's Company Shares held
by any of such members as of the date hereof, to vote such Person's Company
Shares as instructed by Investor Holdco. Each member of Investor Holdco (other
than Investor Holdco) and each of their respective Permitted Assignees, shall
take all other necessary or desirable actions within such Person's control
(including, without limitation, attending meetings in person or by proxy for
purposes of obtaining a quorum and execution of written consents in lieu of
meetings) to effect the voting of such Person's Company Shares in accordance
with this provision.

(b) To secure each member of Investor Holdco's (and their respective Permitted
Assignees) obligations to vote their respective Company Shares in accordance
with Section 2.02(a) of this Agreement, each such Person hereby appoints an
officer of Investor Holdco designated by the management board of Investor
Holdco, as such Person's true and lawful proxy and attorney, with the power to
act alone and with full power of substitution, to vote all of such Person's
Company Shares as set forth in this Agreement and to execute all appropriate
instruments consistent with this Agreement on behalf of such Person if, and
only if, such Person fails to vote all of such Person's Company Shares or
execute such other instruments in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement within five days of Investor Holdco's written request for such
Person's written consent or signature. The proxy and power granted by each
Person pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) are coupled with an interest and are
given to secure


 

--- 
| | 

|

12 

the performance of such Person's duties under this Agreement, provided, that
the proxy and power set forth in this Section 2.02(b) shall not be used to
affect an Other Selling Holder's (as defined in Section 2.03(a)) election to
not participate in a Sell Down (as defined in Section 2.03(a)). Each such
member of Investor Holdco (and their respective Permitted Assignees) agrees to
execute an irrevocable proxy in favor the designated individual as and when
identified, if requested by Investor Holdco. Each such proxy and power will be
irrevocable for the term hereof. The proxy and power, so long as any such
Person is an individual, will survive the death, incompetency and disability
of such party or any other individual holder of any Person's Company Shares,
as the case may be, and, so long as such Person is an entity, will survive the
merger or reorganization of such party or any other entity holding any of a
Person's Company Shares.

Section 2.03. Investor Holdco Sell-Downs; Distributions of Investor Holdco
Company Shares. In the event Investor Holdco proposes to effect a private
block sale or resale or to demand or participate in a registered offering of
Company Shares held by Investor Holdco (which such sale shall be proportionate
among members of Investor Holdco) (a "Sell-Down"), Investor Holdco shall
promptly provide written notice to (i) each Holder other than the RockPile
Holders and (ii) each equityholder of Investor Holdco (collectively, the
"Other Selling Holders"), specifying the number and percentage of Company
Shares then held by Investor Holdco to be sold in such Sell-Down, the number
of Company Shares each Other Selling Holder shall be obligated to sell in such
Sell Down (calculated on a pro rata basis based on such Other Selling Holder's
beneficial ownership of Company Shares) and all other material terms and
conditions of the Sell-Down (the "Sell-Down Notice"). Each Other Selling
Holder shall be obligated to participate in such Sell-Down, unless such Other
Selling Holder delivers a written notice to Investor Holdco by the close of
business on the date which is 10 Business Days after the Sell-Down Notice is
delivered to such Other Selling Holder, which such notice shall include the
number of Company Shares such Other Selling Holder elects to exclude from such
Sell-Down (the "Excluded Company Shares", and such notifying Other Selling
Holder, the "Non-Participating Holder"). Any Other Selling Holder that does
not deliver such notice shall be obligated to participate in the Sell Down
with respect to the number of Company Shares set forth in the Sell-Down
Notice. If any Other Selling Holder does not participate in such Sell-Down,
Investor Holdco shall, unless prohibited by applicable Law, promptly
distribute the Excluded Company Shares to the Non-Participating Holder,
provided, that (i) the Non-Participating Holder complies with the provisions
of Section 2.03(b) and (ii) the Excluded Company Shares shall be subject to
the same restrictions on voting, transfer, market stand-off and lock-up
provisions to which the Company Shares of Investor Holdco to be sold in the
Sell-Down are subject in this Agreement and/or with respect to such Sell-Down
(the "Transaction Transfer Restrictions"). Subject to compliance with
applicable Law, the Excluded Company Shares may be sold or otherwise disposed
of by a Non-Participating Holder so long as no Transaction Transfer
Restriction period is in effect. Investor Holdco shall provide further notice
to such Non-Participating Holder or its representatives of its intention to
effect a Sell-Down not more than 30 calendar days prior to the intended date
for the completion of such Sell-Down, in which event the Non-Participating
Holder, after receiving notice of such Sell-Down, shall (notwithstanding its
earlier election in respect of Excluded Company Shares) have the right to
participate in such Sell-Down with Investor Holdco on the same terms and
conditions as Investor Holdco pro rata based on the Non-Participating Holder's
beneficial ownership of Company Shares, and, if not


 

--- 
| | 

|

13 

participating in such Sell-Down, shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the
Excluded Company Shares (or other Company Shares beneficially owned by such
holder) during such 30 calendar day period following delivery of such notice
and such longer transfer, market stand-off or lock up provision that Investor
Holdco shall become subject to in connection with such Sell-Down.

(a) Any Person who receives a distribution of Company Shares shall, to the
extent not already a party hereto, execute and deliver a joinder agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, agreeing to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if such Person were a party
hereto, whereupon such Person will be treated as a Holder for all purposes of
this Agreement, with the same benefits and obligations hereunder as the
distributing Holder with respect to the distributed Registrable Securities.

ARTICLE III 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 3.01. Demand Registration.

(a) Demand Rights. At any time (i) after the expiration of the Lockup Period,
(A) any Holders (other than the RockPile Holders) that collectively and
beneficially own at least 20% of the total issued and outstanding Registrable
Securities, (B) any Holders (other than the RockPile Holders) that
collectively and beneficially own at least 10% of the total issued and
outstanding Registrable Securities, provided they beneficially own Registrable
Securities equivalent to at least 50% of the Registrable Securities
beneficially owned by them as of the Effective Date, or (ii) after the
expiration of the RockPile Lockup Period, RockPile Holdco or the White Deer
Holder (each such Holder in clause (i) or (ii), a "Demand Party"), may,
subject to Section 3.11, make a written request (a "Demand Notice") to the
Company for Registration of all or part of the Registrable Securities held by
the Demand Party (or, with respect to a Demand Notice by RockPile Holdco or
the White Deer Holder, all or part of the Registrable Securities held by the
RockPile Holders) (i) on Form S-1 (a "Long-Form Registration") or (ii) on Form
S-3 (a "Short-Form Registration") if the Company qualifies to use such short
form (any such requested Long-Form Registration or Short-Form Registration, a
"Demand Registration"). Each Demand Notice shall specify the aggregate amount
of Registrable Securities held by the Demand Party to be registered and the
intended methods of disposition thereof, provided that in the case of a Demand
Notice from Investor Holdco, the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities
shall include Registrable Securities from each member of Investor Holdco on a
pro rata basis based on each such member's beneficial ownership of Registrable
Securities, unless such member otherwise directs Investor Holdco to include
less than its pro rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with
Section 2.03. Registrable Securities requested to be included on behalf of the
RockPile Holders shall be included pro rata from each RockPile Holder based on
each such Holders' beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities unless all
RockPile Holders have provided the Company with their written consent to such
request. Subject to Section 3.11, after delivery of such Demand Notice, the
Company (x) shall file promptly (and, in any event, within (i) ninety (90)
days in the case of a request for a Long-Form Registration or (ii) thirty (30)
days in the case of a request for a Short-Form Registration, in each case,
following delivery of such Demand Notice) with the SEC a Registration
Statement relating to such Demand Registration (a "Demand Registration
Statement"), and (y) shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such


 

--- 
| | 

|

14 

Demand Registration Statement to promptly be declared effective under (x) the
Securities Act and (y) the "Blue Sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any
Participating Holder or any underwriter, if any, reasonably requests.
Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, including but not limited to
Section 3.02(b), the Company shall not be obligated to maintain a registration
statement pursuant to a Demand Registration effective for more than (x) 360
days plus the length of any period in which either a Demand Suspension or
Shelf Suspension is in effect instituted by the Company pursuant to Section
3.01(d) or Section 3.02(d), respectively, during such 360 day period or (y)
such shorter period when all of the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement have been sold pursuant thereto.

(b) Demand Withdrawal. The Demand Party may withdraw its Registrable
Securities from a Demand Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness
of the applicable Demand Registration Statement. Upon delivery of a notice by
the Demand Party to such effect, the Company shall cease all efforts to secure
effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement and promptly
notify each other Participating Holder of such withdrawal. Subject to Section
3.08(c), the Demand Holders shall reimburse the Company for all its reasonable
out-of-pocket Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the attempted
Demand Registration. If the Demand Holders reimburse the Company for its
reasonable out-of-pocket Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the
attempted Demand Registration, the attempted Demand Registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration for purposes of Section 3.11.

(c) Demand Company Notice. Subject to Section 3.11, promptly upon delivery of
any Demand Notice (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a "Demand Company
Notice") of any such Registration request to (i) all Holders (other than the
Demand Party or the RockPile Holders) and (ii) RockPile Holdco and the White
Deer Holder, and the Company shall include in such Demand Registration all
such Registrable Securities of such Holders which the Company has received
written requests for inclusion therein (including, with respect to RockPile
Holdco and the White Deer Holder, all or part of the Registrable Securities
held by the RockPile Holders)within ten (10) Business Days after the date that
such Demand Company Notice has been delivered except for such Registrable
Securities that are withdrawn from such Demand Registration by written notice
of the Holder thereof at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable
Demand Registration Statement. All requests made pursuant to this Section
3.01(c) shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities of such
Holder to be registered. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a
Demand Notice by a Demand Party (other than RockPile Holdco and the White Deer
Holder) is delivered in accordance with this Section 3.01 prior to the
expiration of the RockPile Lockup Period, each of the RockPile Holders shall
be permitted to include any Registrable Securities held by such RockPile
Holder in the applicable Demand Registration provided such securities
requested to be included on behalf of the RockPile Holders shall be included
pro rata from each RockPile Holder based on each such Holders' beneficial
ownership of Registrable Securities unless all RockPile Holders have provided
the Company with their written consent to such request.

(d) Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration. If the Company shall furnish
to the Participating Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive
Officer or equivalent senior executive officer of the Company stating that the
filing, effectiveness or continued use of a Demand Registration Statement
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure,


 

--- 
| | 

|

15 

then the Company may delay the filing (but not the preparation of) or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Demand Registration Statement (a
"Demand Suspension"); provided, however, that the Company, unless otherwise
approved in writing by the Holders of a majority of the Company Shares that
elected to participate in the registration in respect of any Demand
Suspension, shall not be permitted to exercise aggregate Demand Suspensions
and Shelf Suspensions more than twice, or for more than an aggregate of 90
days, in each case, during any 12-month period; provided, further, that in the
event of a Demand Suspension, such Demand Suspension shall terminate at such
earlier time as the Company would no longer be required to make any Adverse
Disclosure. Each Participating Holder shall keep confidential the fact that a
Demand Suspension is in effect, the certificate referred to above and its
contents unless and until otherwise notified by the Company, except (A) for
disclosure to such Participating Holder's employees, agents and professional
advisers who reasonably need to know such information for purposes of
assisting the Participating Holder with respect to its investment in the
Company Shares and agree to keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the
extent required in order to comply with reporting obligations to its limited
partners or other direct or indirect investors who have agreed to keep such
information confidential, (C) if and to the extent such matters are publicly
disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that,
to the actual knowledge of such Participating Holder, was not subject to an
obligation or duty of confidentiality to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(D) as required by law, rule or regulation. In the case of a Demand
Suspension, the Participating Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable
Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in connection with any sale
or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon
delivery of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify
the Participating Holders upon the termination of any Demand Suspension, amend
or supplement the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, if
necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission and furnish
to the Participating Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus and any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as any
Participating Holder may reasonably request. The Company agrees, if necessary,
to supplement or make amendments to the Demand Registration Statement if
required by the registration form used by the Company for the applicable
Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by
the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, or as
may reasonably be requested by the Demand Party.

(e) Underwritten Offering. If the Demand Party so requests, an offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be in the form
of an Underwritten Offering, and the Demand Party shall have the right to
select the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering. If
the Demand Party intends to sell the Registrable Securities covered by its
demand by means of an Underwritten Offering, the Demand Party shall so advise
the Company as part of its Demand Notice, and the Company shall include such
information in the Demand Company Notice.

(f) Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand Registrations. If the
managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering of
the Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration advise the Board
of Directors in writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of
securities requested to be included in such Demand Registration exceeds the
number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant


 

--- 
| | 

|

16 

adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered
or the market for the securities offered, the securities to be included in
such Demand Registration (i) first, if RockPile Holdco or the White Deer
Holder is the Demand Party, shall be allocated pro rata among the RockPile
Holders based on each RockPile Holder's Pro Rata Percentage unless all
RockPile Holders have provided the Company with their written consent to such
request, (ii) second, and only if all the securities referred to in clause (i)
have been included in such Registration, shall be allocated pro rata among the
Holders that have requested to participate in such Demand Registration based
on each Holder's Pro Rata Percentage (provided that any securities thereby
allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder's request shall be reallocated
among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner), (iii) third, and only
if all the securities referred to in clause (ii) have been included in such
Registration, the number of securities that the Company proposes to include in
such Registration that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect and (iv) fourth,
and only if all of the securities referred to in clause (iii) have been
included in such Registration, any other securities eligible for inclusion in
such Registration that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect.

Section 3.02. Shelf Registration.

(a) Filing. Following the IPO, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to qualify for Registration on Form S-3 for secondary sales. Promptly
following the date on which the Company becomes eligible to Register on Form
S-3 (the "S-3 Eligibility Date"), the Company shall notify, in writing,
Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, then the Holders, of such eligibility and its intention to file
and maintain a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the
Registrable Securities held by Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is no
longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Holders, (the "Eligibility
Notice"). Promptly following receipt of such Eligibility Notice (but in no
event more than ten (10) days after receipt of such Eligibility Notice), each
of (i) the RockPile Holders and (ii) Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco is
no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Majority Holders (the
RockPile Holders, Investor Holdco or the Majority Holders, as applicable, in
such capacity, the "Initial S-3 Holder"), shall deliver a written notice to
the Company, which notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable
Securities held by the Initial S-3 Holder to be covered by such Shelf
Registration Statement and the intended methods of distribution thereof (the
"S-3 Shelf Notice"). An S-3 Shelf Notice delivered by Investor Holdco, or, if
Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the
Majority Holders shall include, with respect to Registrable Securities to be
registered on behalf of the Sponsors, Registrable Securities pro rata from
each Sponsor based on each such Holders' beneficial ownership of Registrable
Securities, unless such Holder otherwise directs the Demand Party to include
less than its pro rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with
Section 2.03. An S-3 Shelf Notice delivered by RockPile Holdco or the White
Deer Holder, with respect to Registrable Securities to be registered on behalf
of the RockPile Holders, shall include Registrable Securities pro rata from
each RockPile Holder based on each such Holders' beneficial ownership of
Registrable Securities unless all RockPile Holders have provided the Company
with their written consent to such request. Following delivery of the S-3
Shelf Notices, the Company (x) shall file promptly (and, in any event, within
the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days of receipt of the S-3 Shelf Notices and
(ii) forty (40) days after delivery of the Eligibility Notice)

|

17 

with the SEC such Shelf Registration Statement (which shall be an automatic
Shelf Registration Statement if the Company qualifies at such time to file
such a Shelf Registration Statement) relating to the offer and sale of all
Registrable Securities requested for inclusion therein by the Initial S-3
Holder and, to the extent requested under Section 3.02(c), the other Holders
from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by
such Holders (to the extent permitted in this Section 3.02) and set forth in
the Shelf Registration Statement and (y) shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be promptly declared effective
under the Securities Act (including upon the filing thereof if the Company
qualifies to file an automatic Shelf Registration Statement); provided,
however, that if the Initial S-3 Holder reasonably believes that the Company
will become S-3 eligible and delivers a S-3 Shelf Notice following the IPO but
prior to the S-3 Eligibility Date, the Company shall not be obligated to file
(but shall be obligated to prepare) such Shelf Registration Statement on Form
S-3.

(b) Continued Effectiveness. Subject to Section 3.01(a), the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to keep any Shelf Registration Statement filed
pursuant to Section 3.02(a) continuously effective under the Securities Act in
order to permit the Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by Shelf
Holders until the earliest of (i) the date as of which all Registrable
Securities have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or
another Registration Statement filed under the Securities Act (but in no event
prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities
Act and Rule 174 thereunder), (ii) the date as of which each of the Shelf
Holders is permitted to sell its Registrable Securities without Registration
pursuant to Rule 144 without volume limitation or other restrictions on
transfer thereunder, (iii) such shorter period as (x) RockPile Holdco or the
White Deer Holder, provided the RockPile Holders are holding a majority of the
Registrable Securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement, or (y)
Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, then Shelf Holders holding a majority of the Registrable
Securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement, shall agree in writing
(such period of effectiveness, the "Shelf Period"). Subject to Section
3.02(d), the Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best
efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf
Period if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action
that would result in Shelf Holders not being able to offer and sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during
the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is (x) a Shelf Suspension
permitted pursuant to Section 3.02(d) or (y) required by applicable law, rule
or regulation.

(c) Company Notices. Promptly upon delivery of any S-3 Shelf Notice pursuant
to Section 3.02(a) (each, a "Shelf Notice") (but in no event more than five
(5) Business Days thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice of
such Shelf Notice to (i) the Holders (other than the Initial S-3 Holder and
the RockPile Holders) and (ii) RockPile Holdco and the White Deer Holder and
the Company shall include in such Shelf Registration all such Registrable
Securities of such other Holders which the Company has received a written
request for inclusion therein (including, with respect to RockPile Holdco and
the White Deer Holder, all or part of the Registrable Securities held by the
RockPile Holders) within five (5) Business Days after such written notice is
delivered to such other Holders (each such Holder delivering such a request
together with the Initial S-3 Holder, if applicable, a "Shelf Holder");
provided, that, except in connection with an Underwritten Shelf Takedown the
Company shall not include in


 

--- 
| | 

|

18 

such Shelf Registration Registrable Securities of any Holder in an amount in
excess of such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage. If the Company is permitted by
applicable law, rule or regulation to add selling stockholders to a Shelf
Registration Statement without filing a post-effective amendment, a Holder may
request the inclusion of an amount of such Holder's Registrable Securities not
to exceed such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage in such Shelf Registration
Statement at any time or from time to time after the filing of a Shelf
Registration Statement, and the Company shall add such Registrable Securities
to the Shelf Registration Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable, and
such Holder shall be deemed a Shelf Holder. Registrable Securities requested
to be included on behalf of the RockPile Holders shall be included pro rata
from each RockPile Holder based on each such Holders' beneficial ownership of
Registrable Securities unless all RockPile Holders have provided the Company
with their written consent to such request.

(d) Suspension of Registration. If the Company shall furnish to the Shelf
Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent
senior executive officer of the Company stating that the continued use of a
Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 3.02(a) would require
the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, then the Company may suspend use of
the Shelf Registration Statement (a "Shelf Suspension"); provided, however,
that the Company unless otherwise approved in writing the Holders of a
majority of the Company Shares that demanded the registration, in respect of
any Demand Suspension, shall not be permitted to exercise aggregate Demand
Suspensions and Shelf Suspensions more than twice, or for more than an
aggregate of 90 days, in each case, during any 12-month period; provided
further that in the event of a Shelf Suspension, such Shelf Suspension shall
terminate at such earlier time as the Company would no longer be required to
make any Adverse Disclosure. Each Shelf Holder shall keep confidential the
fact that a Shelf Suspension is in effect, the certificate referred to above
and its contents unless and until otherwise notified by the Company, except
(A) for disclosure to such Shelf Holder's employees, agents and professional
advisers who reasonably need to know such information for purposes of
assisting the Holder with respect to its investment in the Company Shares and
agree to keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in
order to comply with reporting obligations to its limited partners or other
direct or indirect investors who have agreed to keep such information
confidential, (C) if and to the extent such matters are publicly disclosed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, to the actual
knowledge of such Shelf Holder, was not subject to an obligation or duty of
confidentiality to the Company and its Subsidiaries and (D) as required by
law, rule or regulation. In the case of a Shelf Suspension, the Holders agree
to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or
purchase, Registrable Securities, upon delivery of the notice referred to
above. The Company shall immediately notify the Shelf Holders upon the
termination of any Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the Prospectus and
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any
untrue statement or omission and furnish to the Shelf Holders such numbers of
copies of the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so amended
or supplemented as any Shelf Holder may reasonably request. The Company
agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf
Registration Statement if required by the registration form used by the
Company for the applicable Registration or by the instructions applicable to
such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the Initial S-3

(e) Shelf Take-Downs.

(i) An offering or sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement (each, a "Shelf Take-Down") may be initiated by
RockPile Holdco, the White Deer Holder, Investor Holdco, or if Investor Holdco
is no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, by any Shelf Holder (in such
capacity, the "Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holder") in respect of such
Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holder's Registrable Securities included in such
Shelf Registration Statement. Except as set forth in Section 3.02(e)(iii) with
respect to Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Downs, the Initiating Shelf Take-
Down Holder shall not be required to permit the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities by other Shelf Holders in connection with any such Shelf Take-Down
initiated by such Initiating Shelf Take-Down Holder.

(ii) Subject to Section 3.11, if the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities included in the Shelf Registration Statement elect by written
request to the Company, a Shelf Take-Down shall be in the form of an
Underwritten Offering (an "Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice") and the
Company shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement for such
purpose as soon as practicable. Such Holders shall have the right to select
the managing underwriter or underwriters to administer such offering. The
provisions of Section 3.01(f) shall apply to any Underwritten Offering
pursuant to this Section 3.02(e).

(iii) If the plan of distribution set forth in any Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down Notice includes a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road
show") or other substantial marketing effort by the Company and the
underwriters over a period expected to exceed 48 hours (a "Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down"), promptly upon delivery of such Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down Notice (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a "Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down Notice") of such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down to all Shelf Holders (other than the Initiating Shelf Take-Down
Holder), and the Company shall include in such Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down all such Registrable Securities of such Shelf Holders that are
Registered on such Shelf Registration Statement for which the Company has
received written requests, which requests must specify the aggregate amount of
such Registrable Securities of such Holder to be offered and sold pursuant to
such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, for inclusion therein within three
(3) Business Days after the date that such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down Notice has been delivered.

(iv) For so long as no black-out period as described in and subject to the
terms of Section 3.04 with respect to a Marketed Underwritten Offering is then
in effect, a Shelf Holder may initiate a Shelf Take-Down with respect to the
Registrable Securities of such Shelf Holder so long as such Shelf Take-Down is
not in the form of an Underwritten Offering.

Section 3.03. Piggyback Registration.

(a) Participation. If the Company at any time after the IPO proposes to file a
Registration Statement with respect to any offering of Company Shares for its
own account or for the account of any other Persons (other than (i) a
Registration under Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, it being understood that this
clause (i) does not limit the rights of Holders to make written requests
pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 or otherwise limit the applicability
thereof, (ii)

20 

a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or such other similar successor
forms then in effect under the Securities Act), (iii) a registration of
securities solely relating to an offering and sale to employees, directors or
consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to any employee stock
plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement, (iv) a registration not
otherwise covered by clause (iii) above pursuant to which the Company is
offering to exchange its own securities for other securities or (v) a
Registration Statement relating solely to dividend reinvestment or similar
plans) (a "Company Public Sale"), then, (A) as soon as practicable (but in no
event less than 60 days prior to the proposed date of filing of such
Registration Statement), the Company shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to Investor Holdco, RockPile Holdco, the White Deer Holder and
all Demand Parties and shall offer Investor Holdco, RockPile Holdco, the White
Deer Holder and all Demand Parties the opportunity to Register under such
Registration Statement such number of Registrable Securities as Investor
Holdco, RockPile Holdco, the White Deer Holder and such Demand Parties may
request in writing (provided (i) that the number of Registrable Securities
Registered by Investor Holdco pursuant to this section Section 3.03(a) shall
be pro rata among members of Investor Holdco based on the Registrable
Securities beneficially owned by each such member of Investor Holdco, unless
such member of Investor Holdco otherwise directs Investor Holdco to include
less than its pro rata share of Registrable Securities in accordance with
Section 2.03, (ii) the number of Registrable Securities requested to be
included by RockPile Holdco and the White Deer Holder pursuant to this section
Section 3.03(a) shall be pro rata from each RockPile Holder based on each such
Holders' beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities unless all RockPile
Holders have provided the Company with written consent to such request)
delivered to the Company within ten (10) days of delivery of such written
notice by the Company, and (B) subject to Section 3.03(c), as soon as
practicable after the expiration of such 10-day period (but in no event less
than fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed date of filing of such
Registration Statement), the Company shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to the remaining Holders, and such notice shall offer each
such Holder the opportunity to Register under such Registration Statement such
number of Registrable Securities as such Holder may request in writing within
ten (10) days of delivery of such written notice by the Company. Subject to
Section 3.03(b) and (c), the Company shall include in such Registration
Statement all such Registrable Securities that are requested by Holders to be
included therein in compliance with the immediately foregoing sentence (a
"Piggyback Registration"); provided that if at any time after giving written
notice of its intention to Register any equity securities and prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such
Piggyback Registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to
Register or to delay Registration of the equity securities covered by such
Piggyback Registration, the Company shall give written notice of such
determination to each Holder that had requested to Register its, his or her
Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement and, thereupon, (1) in
the case of a determination not to Register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to Register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
Registration, without prejudice, however, to the rights of a Demand Party, to
request that such Registration be effected as a Demand Registration under
Section 3.01, and (2) in the case of a determination to delay Registering, in
the absence of a request by a Demand Party, that such Registration be effected
as a Demand Registration under Section 3.01, shall be permitted to delay
Registering any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in
Registering the other equity securities covered by such Piggyback
Registration. If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement is to be
underwritten, the Company shall so advise the Holders as a part of the written
notice given pursuant this Section

|

21 

3.03(a), and each Holder making a request for a Piggyback Registration
pursuant to this Section 3.03(a) must, and the Company shall make such
arrangements with the managing underwriter or underwriters so that each such
Holder may, participate in such Underwritten Offering, subject to the
conditions of Section 3.03(b) and (c). If the offering pursuant to such
Registration Statement is to be on any other basis, the Company shall so
advise the Holders as part of the written notice given pursuant to this
Section 3.03(a), and each Holder making a request for a Piggyback Registration
pursuant to this Section 3.03(a) must, and the Company shall make such
arrangements so that each such Holder may, participate in such offering on
such basis, subject to the conditions of Section 3.03(b) and (c). Each Holder
shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of its Registrable Securities from
a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the RockPile
Holders shall be permitted to participate in any Piggyback Registration in
accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to the expiration of the RockPile
Lockup Period provided that Investor Holdco has requested its Registrable
Securities be included in such offering.

(b) Priority of Piggyback Registration. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities
included in a Piggyback Registration informs the Company and the Holders that
have requested to participate in such Piggyback Registration in writing that,
in its or their opinion, the number of securities which such Holders and any
other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number which can
be sold in such offering without being likely to have a significant adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the
market for the securities offered, then the securities to be included in such
Registration shall be (i) first, the number of Registrable Securities that, in
the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without
having such adverse effect in such Registration, which such number shall be
allocated pro rata among the Holders that have requested to participate in
such Registration based on each Holder's Pro Rata Percentage (provided that
any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder's request
shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in like manner)
and (ii) second, and only if all of the Registrable Securities referred to in
clause (i) have been included in such Registration, any other securities
eligible for inclusion in such Registration that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse
effect in such Registration.

(c) Restrictions on Holders. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein,
(i) prior to the distribution by Investor Holdco of all its Registrable
Securities held as of the date hereof to its members, Holders other than
Investor Holdco, the RockPile Holders or a Demand Party may not request
Piggyback Registration of Registrable Securities with respect to any offering
of Company Shares for the Company's account unless Investor Holdco, a RockPile
Holder or a Demand Party requests such Piggyback Registration with respect to
such offering and (ii) the RockPile Holders may not request Piggyback
Registration of Registrable Securities with respect to any offering of Company
Shares for the Company's account unless Investor Holdco or any other Holder
(other than the RockPile Holders) requests such Piggyback Registration with
respect to such offering.

(d) No Effect on Demand Registrations. No Registration of Registrable
Securities effected pursuant to a request under this Section 3.03 shall be
deemed to have been

22 

effected pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 or shall relieve the Company
of its obligations under Section 3.01 or Section 3.02.

Section 3.04. Black-out Periods.

(a) Black-out Periods for Holders. In the event of a Company Public Sale of
the Company's equity securities in an Underwritten Offering, each of the
Holders agrees, if requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in
such Underwritten Offering (and, with respect to a Company Public Sale other
than the IPO, if and only if Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no
longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then the Majority Holders, agrees
to such request), not to (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise
dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or
could be expected to, result in the disposition by any Person at any time in
the future of) any Company Shares (including Company Shares that may be deemed
to be beneficially owned by the undersigned in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC and Company Shares that may be issued upon exercise of
any options or warrants) or securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Company Shares, (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives
transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic benefits or risks of ownership of Company Shares, whether any such
transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery
of Company Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise, (3) make any
demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a Registration
Statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration
of any Company Shares or securities convertible into or exercisable or

publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, in each case,
during the period beginning seven (7) days before and ending 180 days (in the
event of the IPO) or 90 days (in the event of any other Company Public Sale)
(or, in each case, such other period as may be reasonably requested by the
Company or the managing underwriter or underwriters to accommodate regulatory
restrictions on (i) the publication or other distribution of research reports
and (ii) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to,
the restrictions contained in the FINRA rules or any successor provisions or
amendments thereto) after the date of the underwriting agreement entered into
in connection with such Company Public Sale, to the extent timely notified in
writing by the Company or the managing underwriter or underwriters; provided,
that (i) no Holder shall be subject to any such black-out period of longer
duration or other greater restriction than that applicable to (x) Investor
Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, then any of the Majority Holders or (y) any director or executive
officer who holds Registrable Securities and (ii) if any Holder is released
from any such lockup restrictions, all other Holders shall also be released
from such lockup restrictions to the same extent. If requested by the managing
underwriter or underwriters of any such Company Public Sale (and, with respect
to any such Company Public Sale other than the IPO, if and only if Investor
Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable
Securities, then the Majority Holders, agrees to such request), the Holders
shall execute a separate agreement to the foregoing effect. The Company may
impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Company Shares (or other
securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of the period
referenced above.

(b) Black-out Period for the Company and Others. In the case of an offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 that is a

23 

Underwritten Offering, the Company and each of the Holders agree, if requested
by (x) a majority of the Registrable Securities participating in the Marketed
Underwritten Offering (the "Participating Majority"), or (y) the managing
underwriter or underwriters with respect to such Marketed Underwritten
Offering, not to (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or
enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or would reasonably
be expected to, result in the disposition by any Person at any time in the
future of) any Company Shares (including Company Shares that may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by the undersigned in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC and Company Shares that may be issued upon exercise of
any options or warrants) or securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Company Shares, (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives
transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the
economic benefits or risks of ownership of Company Shares, whether any such
transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery
of Company Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise, (3) make any
demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a Registration
Statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration
of any Company Shares or securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Company Shares or any other securities of the Company or (4)
publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, in each case,
during the period beginning seven (7) days before, and ending 90 days (or such
lesser period as may be agreed by (x) a Participating Majority, or, (y) if
applicable, the managing underwriter or underwriters) (or such other period as
may be reasonably requested by a Participating Majority, or the managing
underwriter or underwriters to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (i) the
publication or other distribution of research reports and (ii) analyst
recommendations and opinions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions
contained in the FINRA rules or any successor provisions or amendments
thereto) after, the date of the underwriting agreement entered into in
connection with such Marketed Underwritten Offering, to the extent timely
notified in writing by (x) a Participating Majority, or (y) the managing
underwriter or underwriters, as the case may be; provided that (i) no Holder
shall be subject to any such black-out period of longer duration or other
greater restriction than that applicable to a Participating Majority, and (ii)
if any Holder is released from any such lockup restrictions, all other Holders
shall also be released from such lockup restrictions to the same extent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may effect a public sale or
distribution of securities of the type described above and during the periods
described above if such sale or distribution is made pursuant to Registrations
on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such Forms or as part of any
Registration of securities for offering and sale to employees, directors or
consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any employee stock
plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement. The Company agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from each of its directors and officers and
each other holder of restricted securities of the Company which securities are
the same as or similar to the Registrable Securities being Registered, or any
restricted securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
of such securities, an agreement not to effect any public sale or distribution
of such securities during any such period referred to in this paragraph,
except as part of any such Registration, if permitted. Without limiting the
foregoing (but subject to Section 3.07), if after the date hereof the Company

to demand or participate in a Registration, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, provide that the agreement with respect thereto shall
include such Person's agreement to comply with any black-out period required
by this Section as if it were a Holder hereunder. If requested by the managing
underwriter or underwriters of any such

Marketed Underwritten Offering (and if a Participating Majority agrees to such
request), the Holders shall execute a separate agreement to the foregoing
effect. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the
Company Shares (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction
until the end of the period referenced above.

(b) Piggyback Registrations. If the Company proposes to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by Section 3.03 and such
securities are to be distributed in an Underwritten Offering through one or
more underwriters, the Company shall, if requested by any Holder pursuant to
Section 3.03 and subject to the provisions of Section 3.03(b) and (c), arrange
for such underwriters to include on the same terms and conditions that apply
to the other sellers in such Registration all the Registrable Securities to be
offered and sold by such Holder among the securities of the Company to be
distributed by such underwriters in such Registration. The Participating
Holders shall be parties to the underwriting agreement between

shall not exceed such Participating Holder's net proceeds from such
Underwritten Offering.

(c) Participation in Underwritten Registrations. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.06(a) and (b) above, no Person may participate in any Underwritten
Offering hereunder unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Persons entitled to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements.

(d) Price and Underwriting Discounts. In the case of an Underwritten Offering
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, the price, underwriting discount and other
financial terms for the Registrable Securities shall be determined by a
Participating Majority.

Section 3.07. No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights. Article III The
Company is not currently a party to, and shall not hereafter enter into any
agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights
granted to the Holders by this Agreement, including allowing any other holder
or prospective holder of any securities of the Company (a) registration rights
in the nature or substantially in the nature of those set forth in Section
3.01, Section 3.02 or Section 3.03 that would have priority over the
Registrable Securities with respect to the inclusion of such securities in any
Registration (except to the extent such registration rights are solely related
to registrations of the type contemplated by Section 3.03(a)(ii) through (iv))
or (b) demand registration rights in the nature or substantially in the nature
of those set forth in Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 that are exercisable prior
to such time as RockPile Holdco, the White Deer Holder and Investor Holdco,
or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then
the Participating Majority, can first exercise its rights under Section 3.01
or Section 3.02, in each case without the prior written consent of RockPile
Holdco, the White Deer Holder and Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is
no longer a Holder of Registrable Securities, then of the Majority Holders.

Holder and each of their respective direct or indirect partners, members or
shareholders and each of such partner's, member's or shareholder's partners
members or shareholders and, with respect to all of the foregoing Persons,
each of their respective Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, trustees
or agents and controlling Persons, each of their respective Representatives
and, with respect to any Holder who is a natural person, the Family Members of

and/or one or more trusts for the sole benefit of such natural person and/or

shall not be liable to any particular indemnified party to the extent that any
such Loss arises out of or is based upon (A) an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such Registration
Statement or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such indemnified party expressly for
use in the preparation thereof or (B) an untrue statement or omission in a
preliminary Prospectus relating to Registrable Securities, if a Prospectus (as
then amended or supplemented) that would have cured the defect was furnished
to the indemnified party from whom the Person asserting the claim giving rise
to such Loss purchased Registrable Securities at least five (5) days prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities to such
Person and a copy of such Prospectus (as amended and supplemented) was not
sent or given by or on behalf of such indemnified party to such Person at or
prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities to
such Person. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company
may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such
Holder. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer
managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the
distribution, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the
same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
indemnified parties.

(b) Indemnification by the Participating Holders. Each Participating Holder
agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers and
each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act

respective direct or indirect partners, members or shareholders and each of
such partner's, member's or shareholder's partners, members or shareholders
and, with respect to all of the foregoing Persons, each of their respective
Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, trustees or agents and each Person
who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act)
such Persons, each of their respective Representatives and, with respect to
any Participating Holder who is a natural person, the Family Members of such
natural person, entities formed for estate or family planning purposes and/or
one or more trusts for the sole benefit of such natural person and/or the
Family Members of such natural Person, from and against any Losses resulting
from (i) any untrue statement of a material fact in any Registration Statement
under which such Registrable Securities of such Participating Holder were
Registered under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or
summary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto or
any documents incorporated by reference therein) or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission to state


 

--- 
| | 

|

34 

therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or
alleged omission) is contained in any information furnished in writing by such
Participating Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, offering circular, Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or other document and has not been corrected in a subsequent
writing prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities
to the Person asserting the claim. In no event shall the liability of such
Participating Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of
the net proceeds received by such Participating Holder under the sale of
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 3.09 shall (i) give prompt written notice
to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification (provided, that, any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, that, any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the
indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the
indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim
within a reasonable time after delivery of notice of such claim from the
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Person, (C) the indemnified party has reasonably
concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses
available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in
addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (D) in the
reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel) a
conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party
with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the
indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such
Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to settle such action, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement, in each case without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, unless the entry of such judgment or
settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release
from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation and (ii) does not
include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure
to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party, and provided, that, any sums
payable in connection with such settlement are paid in full by the
indemnifying party. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be
unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties
shall not, except as specifically set forth in this Section 3.09(c), in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or other
charges of more than one separate firm admitted to


 

--- 
| | 

|

35 

practice in such jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of
more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party
or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the
advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified
parties, or (z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based
upon advice of counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party
and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying
party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
additional counsel or counsels.

(d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 3.09 is unavailable to an indemnified
party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein, then the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with
the acts, statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. In connection with any Registration
Statement filed with the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.09(d) were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 3.09(d).
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to
in Section 3.09(a) and Section 3.09(b) shall be deemed to include, subject to
the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 3.09(d), in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the
Company, a Participating Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount
in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder
under the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution
obligation less any amount paid by such Holders pursuant to Section 3.09(b).
If indemnification is available under this Section 3.09, the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
Section 3.09(a) and Section 3.09(b) hereof without regard to the provisions of
this Section 3.09(d).

(e) No Exclusivity. The remedies provided for in this Section 3.09 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may be available to
any indemnified party at law or in equity or pursuant to any other agreement.

(f) Survival. The indemnities provided in this Section 3.09 shall survive the
transfer of any Registrable Securities by such Holder.

S under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or

Registrable Securities by (i) RockPile Holdco or the White Deer Holder or (ii)
Investor Holdco, or, if Investor Holdco is no longer a Holder of Registrable

Offering or pursuant to a Special Registration, or with the consent of the
RockPile Holdco, White Deer Holder, Investor Holdco or the Participating
Majority, as applicable) any public sale or distribution, or to file any

kind distribution of all or part of its Company Shares to its direct or
indirect equityholders, the Company will reasonably cooperate with and assist
such Holder, such equityholders and the Company's transfer agent to facilitate
such in-kind distribution in the manner reasonably requested by such Holder

Company, each Holder agrees to promptly deliver a certificate to the Company
setting forth the number of Registrable Securities then beneficially owned by

Section 4.02. Contribution of Trican Units.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that Trican or any
of its Affiliates fail to pay, or cause to be paid, amounts due under the
Trican Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 3.8 of the Trican Purchase
Agreement prior to the Final Payment Date (as defined in the Trican Purchase
Agreement) (the "Defaulted Payment Amount"), the number of Class A units of
Investor Holdco ("Class A Units") held by Trican shall be immediately and
automatically, without further action of Investor Holdco, the Company or any
other Person, be reduced by the number of Class A Units (or fraction thereof)
as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Trican Purchase Agreement, which shall have
a value equal to the Defaulted Payment Amount, with the value of each such
Class A Unit calculated in accordance with the good faith determination of the
management board of Investor Holdco, based on the Implied Default Valuation
(as defined in the Trican Purchase Agreement) divided by 1,000,000; provided,
that the members of Investor Holdco agree to treat (and will cause each of
their respective

| | 

|

38 

Affiliates to treat) such reduction in Class A Units as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price (as described in Section 3.1 of the Trican Purchase Agreement)
for all tax purposes. Within ten days following the Final Payment Date,
Investor Holdco shall submit a notice to Trican, with a copy to the Company,
in accordance with Section 10.6 of the Trican Purchase Agreement setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the calculation of any such reduction and the
number of Class A Units held by Trican (and the fully diluted percentage
ownership thereof) after taking into account such cancellation in accordance
with this Section 4.02(a). In connection with such cancellation, Trican shall
forfeit any right to any amounts due or owed with respect to such cancelled
Class A Units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for purposes of this
Section 4.02(a), references in the Trican Purchase Agreement to "Keane Common
Equity Units" and "Class A Units" shall be deemed to refer the Class A Units
under this Agreement.

(b) Promptly following any reduction in the number of Class A Units held by
Trican in accordance with Section 4.02(a), Investor Holdco shall contribute to
the Company the corresponding number of Company Shares then held by Investor
Holdco equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares then held by
Investor Holdco, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is
the number of Class A Units held by Trican that were reduced in accordance
with Section 4.02(a) and (B) the denominator of which is the aggregate number
of Class A Units held by all members of Investor Holdco immediately prior to
the reduction of Class A Units held by Trican in accordance with Section
4.02(a).

Section 4.03. Injunctive Relief. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged that it
will be impossible to measure in money the damage that would be suffered if
the parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them
and that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Person will be
irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Any such
Person shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which
it may be entitled in law or in equity) to injunctive relief, including
specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any action should be
brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of
the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

Section 4.04. Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to enforce
any provision of this Agreement or where any provision hereof is validly
asserted as a defense, the successful party shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition
to any other available remedy.

taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the Parties or
their respective successors, or assigns. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable
for acting or refraining from acting upon any notice, request, consent,
direction, requisition, certificate, order, affidavit, letter, or other paper
or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed
or sent by the proper person or persons, without further inquiry into the
person's or persons' authority. Concurrent with the execution of this Escrow
Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers'
forms in the form of Exhibit C-1 and Exhibit C-2 to this Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.4 Right Not Duty Undertaken. The permissive rights of the Escrow
Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be construed
as duties.

Section 2.5 No Financial Obligation. No provision of this Escrow Agreement
shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability or 

potential financial liability in the performance of its duties or the exercise
of its rights under this Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 
PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT

Section 3.1 Indemnification. Each of Seller and Keane, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against
any and all loss, liability, cost, damage and expense, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses or other reasonable
professional fees and expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by
reason of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent,
arising out of this Escrow Agreement, or the performance by the Escrow Agent
of its obligations hereunder, unless such loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense shall have been due to the bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Escrow Agent; provided, that, as between Seller and
Keane, neither Seller and Keane shall be liable for more than 50% of any such
indemnification amounts. The provisions of this Section 3.1 shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow
Agreement.

Section 3.2 Limitation of Liability. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

Section 3.3 Resignation or Removal. The Escrow Agent may resign by furnishing
written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties may remove
the Escrow Agent by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice of
its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it is
entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as the
case may be, shall be effective sixty (60) days after the delivery of such
notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agent's
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Amount, if
any, and to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed
by the Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow
Agent or in accordance with a court order from a court of competent
jurisdiction. If the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent
prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period following delivery of
such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or
for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be
binding upon the Parties.

Section 3.4 Compensation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation
for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit D,
which compensation shall be paid by one half by Seller and one half by Keane.
The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions for the
disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the
Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or
there is any assignment of 

interest in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or any material
modification hereof, or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the
Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow
Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be
reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
occasioned by any such delay, controversy, litigation or event. The Escrow
Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Amounts
with respect to its unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied
indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or
entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid
fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the
Escrow Amount.

Section 3.5 Disagreements. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to
be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, retain the Escrow
Amounts until the Escrow Agent (a) receives a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-appealable binding arbitration
decision directing delivery of the Escrow Amounts or (b) receives a written
agreement executed by Seller and Keane directing delivery of the Escrow
Amounts in which event the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to disburse the
Escrow Amounts in accordance with such final court order, arbitration
decision, or agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such
agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further question,
inquiry, or consent.

Section 3.6 Merger or Consolidation. Any corporation or association into which
the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion,
sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party,
shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and
shall have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and
privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.

Section 3.7 Attachment of Escrow Amount; Compliance with Legal Orders. In the
event that any of the Escrow Amounts shall be attached, garnished or levied
upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined
by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or any order, judgment or
decree shall be made or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction
affecting the Escrow Amounts, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized,
in its sole discretion, within three (3) days of delivering notice to the
Parties, to respond as it deems appropriate or to comply with all writs,
orders or decrees so entered or issued, or which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction. In the event that the Escrow Agent, following the notice period
set forth in the prior sentence, obeys or complies with any such writ, order
or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person,
firm or corporation, should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding,
such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated. 

Section 3.8 Force Majeure. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable
for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under this
Escrow Agreement arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation,
acts of God; earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of terrorism; civil or
military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots; interruptions, loss or
malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications
services; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or governmental
action; it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances.

FEES OF ESCROW AGENT



TOTAL $[●]





The acceptance fee and the annual escrow fee for each year of the term of this
Escrow Agreement are payable upon execution of this Escrow Agreement. In the
event the escrow is not funded, the acceptance fee and all related expenses,
including attorneys' fees, costs and expenses remain due and payable, and if
paid, will not be refunded. Annual fees cover a full year in advance, or any
part thereof, and thus are not pro-rated in the year of termination.



The fees quoted in this schedule apply to services ordinarily rendered in the
administration of an escrow account and are subject to reasonable adjustment
based on final review of documents, or when the Escrow Agent is called upon to
undertake unusual or extraordinary duties or responsibilities, or as changes
in law, procedures, or the cost of doing business demand. Services in addition
to and not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, including document
amendments and revisions, non-standard cash and/or investment transactions,
calculations, notices and reports, and legal fees, will be billed as expenses.



Unless otherwise indicated, the above fees relate to the establishment of one
escrow account. Additional sub-accounts governed by this Escrow Agreement may
incur an additional charge. Transaction costs include charges for wire
transfers, checks, internal transfers and securities transactions.



The fees quoted in this schedule are subject to reasonable adjustment by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with its customary practices and if it is called
upon to undertake further unusual or extraordinary duties or responsibilities,
or as changes in law, procedures, or the cost of doing business demand.
