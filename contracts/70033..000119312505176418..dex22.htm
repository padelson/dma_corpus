THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of August 26, 2005, by and among Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), NDC Health Information Services (Arizona) Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and NDCHealth Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Shareholder_ ").



WHEREAS, Shareholder owns all of the issued and outstanding shares (the "
_Shares_ ") of the capital stock of the Company;



WHEREAS, the Company is in the business of providing data, analytics and
information management support solutions to pharmaceutical
manufacturers, Biotechnology Firms, Medical Device Manufacturers, Wall Street
investment and private equity firms (buy and sell side) for purposes of their
pharmaceutical and biotechnology analysis and governmental payors, enabling
them, among other things, to evaluate performance, develop strategies and
optimize their marketing and sales efforts, rebate spend and clinical trial
recruitment efforts (the " _Business_ ");



WHEREAS, Shareholder desires to sell and Purchaser desires to purchase the
Shares, for the consideration and on the terms set forth in this Agreement;
and



WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Section 12.1 of this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1 PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES



1.1 Purchase and Sale of the Shares.



On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Shareholder shall sell, and Purchaser shall purchase, all of Shareholders
right, title, and interest in and to the Shares. Shareholder shall transfer
and convey, and Purchaser shall purchase, the Shares free and clear of any
and all Liens, except for restrictions on resale pursuant to applicable state
and federal securities laws.



1.2 Purchase Price.



(a) The purchase price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") for the Shares will be
(i) Three Hundred Eighty Two Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($382,100,000) (the " _Closing Payment Amount_ "), (ii) _plus_ the Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and (iii) _minus_ the Deferred Revenue Adjustment
Amount, if any. The Working Capital Adjustment Amount and the Deferred Revenue Adjustment Amount shall be
determined as set forth in Section 1.4 below.



1.3 Payment of Closing Payment Amount, Arclight Closing Payment.



On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to Shareholder the Closing Payment Amount by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing by Shareholder. A
Federal Reserve Reference Number shall be requested by Purchaser at the time
of the transfer for the purpose of assisting Shareholder in confirming receipt
of the transfer. In addition, at Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Arclight by
wire transfer in immediately available funds the sum of $1,000,000 in
connection with the assignment of the Arclight License (as defined below).



1.4 Determination of Final Purchase Price.



(a) Not later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Shareholder
shall furnish to Purchaser (i) the Closing Balance Sheet, prepared by
Shareholder, and (ii) the Closing Schedule. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with past practice of the Company and consistent with
the method of preparation of the consolidated financial statements of
Shareholder, which financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and shall be otherwise consistent with the Books and Records of the
Company.



(b) Purchaser and Shareholder shall each provide access to the other and the
others accountants to the Books and Records that are under their respective
control or custody and that are necessary to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet
and will cause their respective accountants to provide access to the relevant
work papers.



(c) Purchaser shall have sixty (60) days from the date of its receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Schedule to review the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Schedule and to agree or disagree as to the Final
Purchase Price reflected thereon. If Purchaser does not agree with the Final
Purchase Price reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing
Schedule, then Purchaser shall, within such sixty (60) day period, deliver a
written objection to Shareholder that shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the objection on a line item basis and a computation of the
Final Purchase Price asserted by Purchaser (the " _Objection_ "). Upon
Shareholders receipt of the Objection, Purchaser and Shareholder shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the Objection, but if the Objection cannot
be resolved by negotiation between Shareholder and Purchaser within thirty
(30) days after Shareholders receipt of the Objection, Purchaser and
Shareholder shall cause the Determination Materials to be submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator, which shall review the Determination Materials and,
based solely upon the Determination Materials, determine the Final Purchase
Price based on the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator on a line item basis
which of the positions asserted, either that asserted by Shareholder in the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Schedule or that asserted by Purchaser in
the Objection, is the more correct, and notify the parties in  



 

-2-  writing of its determination of the Final Purchase Price within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of the Determination Materials,
which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties.



(d) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be shared by
Shareholder and Purchaser in inverse proportion to the amount in dispute for
which each of them is successful.



1.5 Reconciliation of Final Purchase Price.



(a) If the Final Purchase Price (as determined in Section 1.4 hereof) is
greater than the Closing Payment Amount, Purchaser shall pay the difference
between such amounts to Shareholder. If the Final Purchase Price is less than
the Closing Payment Amount, Shareholder shall pay the difference between such
amounts to Purchaser.



(b) The payments required by Section 1.5(a) shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the earlier to occur of (i) the date Purchaser and
Shareholder agree on the Final Purchase Price or (ii) the Adjustment Date.



(c) The parties acknowledge that the Purchase Price set forth in Section
1.2(a) is based in part upon an expectation that the Company shall have
available $11,893,594 of net operating losses (" _NOLs_ ") as of the Closing
Date. If the amount of NOLs of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing NOLs_ "), as reflected on the final federal income Tax Return
required to be filed by Shareholder with respect to the Company for the
taxable year including the Closing Date (the " _Final Company Tax Return_
"), is less than $11,893,594, then Shareholder shall pay to Purchaser within
five (5) Business Days after the filing of the Final Company Tax Return the
appropriate amount as determined by reference to Schedule 1.5(c) . If the
Closing NOLs is greater than $11,893,594, then Purchaser shall pay to
Shareholder within five (5) Business Days after written notification from
Shareholder to Purchaser of the Closing NOLs the appropriate amount as
determined by reference to Schedule 1.5(c).

ARTICLE 3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SHAREHOLDER



As an inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the
Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows, it being
understood and agreed that the following representations and warranties shall
be deemed to be made after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
the relevant Purchase Documents:



3.1 Organization and Qualification.



(a) The Company is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation
to do business, and is in good standing,  



 

-4-  in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or
licensed and in good standing that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity.



3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.



The Company has heretofore furnished to Purchaser a complete and correct copy
of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company, each as
amended to date. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws are each in full
force and effect.



3.3 Capitalization.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,000 shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "). As of
the date hereof 100 shares of Company Common Stock are issued and outstanding,
all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no

be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable

Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such exemption.

funded benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or

for the benefits determined as if such plan is maintained on any ongoing
basis (actual or contingent) accrued to the date of this Agreement with
respect to all current and former participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
to determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no

obligations to be less than such benefit obligations;

(a) Purchaser shall, after the Closing Date, cause the Companys By-laws to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
exculpation than are set forth in Article XIII of the By-laws of the Company,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees of the Company
(collectively, " _Indemnified Directors/Officers_ "), unless such
modification shall be required by Law. Purchaser hereby unconditionally
guarantees the obligations of the Company under this Section 6.5(a).



(b) In the event Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, offer to the
Employees employed by Shareholder or the Company as of the Effective Time
that are set forth on Schedule 1.8(b) of the Contribution Agreement (as such
schedule may be updated prior to the Closing Date) (the " _Transferred
Employees_ "), participation in employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided
under the applicable employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA (excluding plans exempt under Section 201(2) of ERISA)), programs,
policies and arrangements of the Company or Shareholder, as applicable, in
effect at the Effective  



 

-24-  Time and disclosed in Schedule 6.6(a)(i) (collectively, " _Current Plans_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.6(a)
shall obligate or commit Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to provide any
Transferred Employee with any equity compensation pursuant to any equity
compensation plans, programs or arrangements sponsored or provided by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for the benefit of its
employees. In the event that the operation of any severance pay plan or
arrangement or any deferred compensation plan or arrangement of the
Shareholder or the Company (the " _Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") after the
Effective Time and through December 31, 2006 causes an excise tax, interest,
and/or penalties under Code Section 409A to be assessed against those
Transferred Employees identified on Schedule 6.6(a)(ii) (the " _Deferred Comp
Employees_ "), Purchaser will, or will cause the Company to, reimburse such
Deferred Comp Employees for such excise tax, interest, and/or penalties
through a gross up payment to be made no later than the date the excise tax,
interest and/or penalties is due; provided, however, (A) if the Closing does
not occur on or before December 31, 2005 (or such later date as may be
provided by subsequent Treasury guidance prior to December 31, 2005 for the
termination of deferral arrangements without consequence under Code Section
409A) (the later of December 31, 2005 or such later date being the " _409A
Deadline_ "), or (B) if Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries
offers to make a lump sum payment on or before the 409A Deadline of the
aggregate payments due to such Deferred Comp Employees pursuant to any such
Deferred Compensation Plans and such offer is not accepted on a timely basis
by such Deferred Comp Employees, then, in either such case, neither Purchaser,
the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall have any liability
to such Deferred Comp Employee for any such gross up payment. In
addition, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shareholder or the Company shall have the right prior to Closing to
amend the Deferred Compensation Plans such that payments made under the
Deferred Compensation Plans will be in accordance with Code Section 409A and
will not be subject to an excise tax, interest and/or penalties. Such
amendments may include an amendment to cause currently non-vested amounts to
pay out in a lump sum upon a qualifying separation from service, and such
amendments may, but need not, be made contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.



(b) Purchaser will, or will cause the Company to, credit each Transferred
Employee with such number of unused vacation days and other paid time
off accrued by each Transferred Employee, as disclosed in Schedule 6.6(b) ,
with the Company or Shareholder prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
the Companys or Shareholders personnel policies applicable to such Employees
on the date hereof, copies of which have been made available to Purchaser;
provided that Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, require that such vacation and other paid time
off be taken by the Transferred Employee prior to December 31, 2006.



(c) The Transferred Employees shall receive credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
for service accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or its
Affiliates under which each such Transferred Employee  



 

-25-  may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same
extent recognized by the Company or Shareholder under comparable plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit.



(d) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Purchaser or its subsidiaries ("
_Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ " ) in which a Transferred Employee may be
eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall waive,
or cause its insurance carrier to waive, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions (if any) with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Transferred Employees under Purchaser Welfare
Benefit Plans to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable plan of Company or Shareholder and shall recognize, for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Transferred Employees in
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.



(e) With respect to the Dependent Care Spending Account Program (" _DCSAP_ ")
and Health Care Spending Account Program (" _HCSAP_ ") maintained by
Shareholder pursuant to Section 125 of the Code (" _Shareholder s Cafeteria
Plan_") in which a Transferred Employee participates on the Effective Time:



(i) As soon as administratively practicable, with respect to each Transferred
Employee who has a DCSAP or HCSAP under Shareholders Cafeteria Plan,
Shareholder will be deemed to transfer to a cafeteria plan maintained by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 125 of the Code (" _Purchaser s Cafeteria
Plan_"), and Purchaser will simultaneously credit, an initial balance in the
HCSAP and DCSAP under Purchasers Cafeteria Plan equal to the Transferred
Employees balance in his or her HCSAP or DCSAP, as the case may be, under
Shareholders Cafeteria Plan as of the date of transfer. On or before the
date of transfer, Shareholder will provide to Purchaser that information
needed by Purchaser to credit the proper amount to each Transferred Employees
HCSAP and DCSAP under Purchasers Cafeteria Plan. Purchasers Cafeteria
Plan will provide that claims may be made for expenses incurred during 2005
that were not submitted to Shareholders Cafeteria Plan prior to the Effective
Time, whether those expenses were incurred before or after the Effective Time.
On and after the Effective Time, all reimbursement claims by a Transferred
Employee for expenses incurred at any point during 2005 that were not
submitted to Shareholders Cafeteria Plan prior to the Effective Time, must be
submitted to Purchasers Cafeteria Plan, and may be so submitted up to the
last day allowed for making claims under Purchasers Cafeteria Plan for the
2005 plan year. Following the deemed transfer contemplated by this paragraph,
Purchaser or its designee will be responsible for administering the payment
of eligible reimbursement claims submitted by Transferred Employees for
payment by his or her HCSAP or DCSAP.



 

-26- (ii) Shareholder will pay to Purchaser on the date of transfer described above
an amount equal to the aggregate DCSAP account balances of the Transferred
Employees under Shareholders Cafeteria Plan as of the Effective Time.



(iii) If a Transferred Employees 2005 HCSAP contributions under Shareholders
Cafeteria Plan are in excess of the 2005 benefits paid by the HCSAP as of the
Effective Time, the Transferred Employee will be deemed to have a "Positive
Account Balance." If a Transferred Employees aggregate 2005 HCSAP
reimbursements under Shareholders Cafeteria Plan are in excess of his or her
2005 HCSAP contributions as of the Effective Time, the Transferred Employee
will be deemed to have a "Negative Account Balance." If as of the Effective
Time, the aggregate Positive Account Balances exceed the aggregate Negative
Account Balances, the Shareholder will pay the difference to Purchaser on the

Balances exceed the aggregate Positive Account Balances, the Purchaser will
pay the difference to Shareholder on the date of transfer.



6.7 Retention of Records.



(a) Purchaser shall retain, and cause the Company after the Closing to
retain, all Books and Records which are in the Companys possession at the

Shareholder shall have the right during business hours, upon reasonable notice
to Purchaser or the Company, to inspect and make copies of any such
records for any reasonable purpose.



(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Shareholder may retain

6.9 Agreement Not to Compete and to Maintain Confidentiality.



(a) For good and valuable consideration and in furtherance of the sale of the
Shares of the Company and the Business to Purchaser hereunder, in order to

Purchaser obtains the  



 

-27-  benefits it reasonably expects to obtain hereunder and to more effectively
protect the value and goodwill of the Shares, Shareholder covenants and
agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, directly or
through its Subsidiaries,



(i) engage in, or own an equity or profit interest in any business which
engages in, the provision of those types of products and services to those
markets, in each case set forth on Schedule 6.9(a), in the United
States (collectively, " _Restricted Activities_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that it will not be deemed a breach of this clause (i) if (A) Shareholder and

less than five percent (5%) of any class of security which is publicly traded
on a national securities exchange or actively traded in a recognized over-the-
counter market, (B) Shareholder engages in any activities contemplated
or permitted by the Data Supply and Services Agreement or the Retail
Informatics Data and Services Agreement, or (C) Shareholder or any of its
Subsidiaries acquires (and thereafter, owns and operates) all or any part of
the stock and/or assets of any company or entity (the " _Acquired Business_
") provided that the trailing twelve-month revenues derived by the Acquired
Business from Restricted Activities do not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the
total revenues of the Acquired Business during such twelve-month period,
provided that Shareholder sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of, to any
third-party which is not an Affiliate of Shareholder, that portion of the
applicable Acquired Business or discontinues that portion of the Acquired
Business in its entirety within eighteen (18) months after acquiring the
Acquired Business; or



(ii) induce or attempt to persuade any customer of the Business to terminate
such relationship.



(b) For good and valuable consideration and in furtherance of the sale of
the Shares of the Company and the Business to Purchaser hereunder, (i)
Shareholder covenants and agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, neither it
nor its Subsidiaries shall employ, attempt to employ, recruit or otherwise
solicit, induce or influence any person to leave employment with the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.9(b)(i)
shall be deemed to prohibit Shareholder from employing any Person (other than
those identified in Schedule 6.9(b)(i) as " _Company Management Employees_ ")
that responds to an advertisement or notice of opportunity for employment
contained in a publication or posting of general circulation, and (ii)
Purchaser and the Company covenant and agree that for a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing
Date, neither they nor their Subsidiaries shall employ, attempt to employ,
recruit or otherwise solicit, induce or influence any person to leave
employment with Shareholder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained
in this Section 6.9(b)(ii) shall be deemed to prohibit Purchaser or the
Company from employing any Person (other than those identified in Schedule
6.9(b)(ii) as " _Shareholder Management Employees_ ") that responds to
an advertisement or notice of opportunity for employment contained in a
publication or posting of general circulation.



 

-28- (c) Shareholder hereby expressly represents and warrants that it has or may
have knowledge of certain commercial and marketing information and material
regarding the Company and the Business (including the documents and materials
identified in Section 6.7(b), lists of customers, product documentation,
development work, lead lists, trade secrets and other proprietary information
of the Company) (the " _Company Confidential Information_ "). Shareholder
acknowledges and agrees that all such Company Confidential Information is
confidential and proprietary and that a substantial portion of the Final
Purchase Price is being paid for such Confidential Information and that it
represents a substantial investment having great economic value to Purchaser,
and constitutes a substantial part of the value to Purchaser of the Business
and the Shares. Purchaser hereby expressly represents and warrants that the
Company has or may have, and Purchaser may acquire by virtue of the
transactions contemplated hereby, knowledge of certain commercial and
marketing information and material regarding Shareholder and the Shareholder
Business (as defined in the Contribution Agreement) (including lists of
customers, product documentation, development work, lead lists, trade secrets
and other proprietary information of Shareholder) (the " _Shareholder
Confidential Information_ ", and, together with the Company Confidential
Information, the " _Confidential Information_ "). Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that all such Shareholder Confidential Information is confidential and
proprietary and that it represents a substantial investment having great
economic value to Shareholder. Each of Shareholder and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that the owner of any such Confidential Information (the "
_Possessing Party_ ") would be irreparably damaged if any of the Possessing
Partys Confidential Information was disclosed by the other party or its
Affiliates (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") to any Person other than the
Possessing Party or its Affiliates. Accordingly, each of Shareholder,
Purchaser, and the Company covenant and agree that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of the Possessing
Party, disclose any Confidential Information for the benefit of any Third
Party, except that a Disclosing Party may disclose a particular item of
Confidential Information if and to the extent (but only if and to the extent)
that such item:



(i) is or becomes publicly known or generally known in the industry of the
Business or the Shareholder Business, as the case may be, through no act or
omission of the Disclosing Party or its Subsidiaries;



(ii) is required to be disclosed to or by order of a governmental agency or a
court of law or otherwise as required by law;  _provided_ that prior to any
such disclosure notice of such requirement of disclosure is provided to the
Possessing Party and the Possessing Party is afforded the reasonable
opportunity to object to such disclosure;



(iii) is required to be disclosed to the attorneys, accountants, or other
agents or employees of the Disclosing Party working on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;



(iv) is contained in or otherwise reflected in information and material
regarding the Disclosing Party and its business; provided that such
disclosure of such item is consistent with the Disclosing Partys past
practice; or



 

-29- (v) is not knowingly disclosed.



(d) Shareholder expressly acknowledges that (i) each of the
covenants contained in this Section 6.9 are integral to the sale to Purchaser
of the Shares and (ii) without the protection of such covenants, neither
Purchaser nor Shareholder would have entered into this Agreement, (iii) the
consideration paid by Purchaser bears no relationship to the damages
Purchaser may suffer in the event of any breach of any of the covenants of
this Section 6.9, and (iv) such covenants contain limitations as to time,
geographical area and/or scope of activity to be restrained which are
reasonable and necessary to protect Purchasers business interests. If this
Section 6.9 shall nevertheless for any reason be held to be excessively broad
as to time, duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent compatible with applicable laws that shall
then apply. Each party hereby further acknowledges that money damages will be
impossible to calculate and may not adequately compensate the other party in
connection with an actual or threatened breach by such party of any of the
provisions of this Section 6.9. Accordingly, each party, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Subsidiaries, hereby expressly waives all rights to
raise the adequacy of the other partys remedies at law as a defense if the
other party seeks to enforce by injunction or other equitable relief the due
and proper performance and observance of the provisions of this Section 6.9.
In addition, the other party shall be entitled to pursue any other available
remedies at law or equity, including the recovery of money damages, in respect
of the actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 6.9.



(e) Each party hereby expressly waives any right to assert inadequacy
of consideration as a defense to enforcement of the non-competition and
confidentiality covenants in this Section 6.9 should such enforcement ever
become necessary.



(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall be construed so as to prevent
Shareholder from delivering the retail pharmacy data delivered pursuant to
the contracts set forth in Schedule 6.9(f) pursuant to any contractual
obligation of Shareholder existing as of the date hereof.



(g) For so long as Shareholder has any continuing obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.9, any successor by merger to Shareholder or any purchaser,
transferee or licensee of any assets of Shareholder constituting substantially
all of the assets of any reporting segment of Shareholder as of the date
hereof shall assume, perform and otherwise be bound by the obligations of
Shareholder set forth in this Section 6.9, and Shareholder shall condition any
such sale, transfer or license on the agreement by such purchaser, transferee
or licensee to be bound by the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.



6.10 Guarantee of Processing Sub Obligations. 



Purchaser hereby unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual performance
of the obligations of Processing Sub (as defined in the Contribution
Agreement) under the Purchase Documents. In connection with such guarantee,
Purchaser hereby waives the

claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Processing Sub.

The parties hereto agree to work together and use their reasonable
best efforts to agree on the specific transition services, costs and time
periods for performance (relating to such transition services) included in the
exhibits to the Transition Services Agreement within 60 days following the
execution of this Agreement. In the event the parties are unable to agree
with respect to a specific transition service, cost or time period, then the
transition services set forth in the Exhibits to the Transition Services
Agreement in the form attached as of the date hereof shall become final and
binding unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.

Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with all reasonable requests of the Indemnitor and shall make available to the

a Claim under Section 10.4(a) hereof shall, without written consent of all

Business.

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.



12.13 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.



Regardless of any conflict of law or choice of law principles that might
otherwise apply, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Parties all expressly agree and acknowledge that the State of
Delaware has a reasonable relationship to the Parties and/or this Agreement.
The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America
located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred
to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Litigation for
the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of any such document,
that it is not subject thereto or that such Litigation may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such Litigation shall be heard and determined in
such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over such Parties solely for such purpose
and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such Litigation in the manner provided
in this Section 12.13 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to
a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no
Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other Party would not, in the event of Litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (iv) each Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 12.13.



12.14 Partial Invalidity.



Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any
one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been
contained herein unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would
result in  



 

-55-  such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be unreasonable. To the extent the deemed deletion of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Parties shall endeavor in good
faith to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as practicable to that
of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.



12.15 Enforcement of Agreement.



The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.
