 **AGREEMENT**

  

 **AND**

  

 **PLAN OF REORGANIZATION**

  

 ** **

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") entered into as of the
19th day of May, 2003, by and between PACIFIC NORTHWEST BANCORP ("Company"),
a Washington corporation, and WELLS FARGO and COMPANY ("Wells Fargo"), a
Delaware corporation.

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to effect a reorganization whereby a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo will merge with and into Company (the
"Merger") pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger
Agreement") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, which
provides, among other things, for the conversion of the shares of Common
Stock of Company, no par value ("Company Common Stock") outstanding
immediately prior to the time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with
the provisions of the Merger Agreement into the right to receive shares of
voting Common Stock of Wells Fargo of the par value of $1-2/3 per share
("Wells Fargo Common Stock"),

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, to effect such reorganization and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto do hereby represent, warrant, covenant and agree as follows:

  



  

**1. Basic Plan of Reorganization**

  



  

(a) _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo (the "Merger Co.") will be merged by
statutory merger with and into Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with
Company as the surviving corporation, in which merger each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger (as defined in paragraph 1(e) below) (other than shares as to which
statutory dissenters appraisal rights have been exercised) will be converted
into the right to receive, and exchanged for certificates or direct
registration statements representing the number of shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock determined by dividing (a) $35.00, by (b) the Wells Fargo
Measurement Price (the "Merger Exchange Ratio"), rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth. The "Wells Fargo Measurement Price" is defined as the average of
the closing prices of a share of Wells Fargo Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange only as reported by Bloomberg LP for each of the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the meeting
of shareholders required by paragraph 4(c) of this Agreement, rounded to the
nearest ten-thousandth.

  

      
   



  



  

(b) _Conversion of Company Options and Warrants_. At the Effective Time of the
Merger, each option (granted by Company or, in the case of stock options (or
warrants) of acquired entities, assumed by Company) to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock under any stock option plan (collectively, the "Company
Stock Option Plans") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Date of the Merger (each, a "Company Stock Option"), shall
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of the Company Common Stock and
shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Wells
Fargo Common Stock (each, a "Substitute Option") in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plans).

  



  

(i) The number of shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock to be subject to the
Substitute Option shall be the product (rounded down to the nearest share) of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option and the Merger Exchange Ratio; and

  



  

(ii) The exercise price per share of Wells Fargo Common Stock under the
Substitute Option shall be equal to the result (rounded down to the nearest
cent) of dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under
the Company Stock Option by the Merger Exchange Ratio.

  



  

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options that
are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be
effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

(c) _Wells Fargo Common Stock Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time of the Merger as defined below, shares of Wells Fargo
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within
such period (a "Common Stock Adjustment"), then the number of shares of Wells
Fargo Common Stock issuable pursuant to subparagraph (a), above, will be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted so that the number of such shares
of Wells Fargo Common Stock issuable in the Merger will equal the number of
shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock would have received pursuant to such Common Stock Adjustment had the
record date therefor been immediately following the Effective Time of the
Merger.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Wells Fargo Common Stock and
no certificates or scrip certificates therefor shall be issued to represent
any such fractional interest, and any holder thereof shall be paid an amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder is entitled by the average of the
closing prices of a share of Wells Fargo Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange only as reported by Bloomberg LP for each of the five (5)

  



  



  

2      
   



  

consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the meeting
of shareholders required by paragraph 4(c) of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Mechanics of Closing Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall be executed and it or Articles
of Merger or a Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of **** Washington within ten (10) business days following
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent set forth in Sections
6 and 7 of this Agreement or on such other date as may be agreed to by the
parties (the "Closing Date"), provided that the Closing Date shall not occur
on the last business day of a calendar month.  Each of the parties agrees to
use its best efforts to cause the Merger to be completed as soon as
practicable after the receipt of final regulatory approval of the Merger and
the expiration of all required waiting periods. The time that the filing
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph is made is herein
referred to as the "Time of Filing." The day on which such filing is made
and accepted is herein referred to as the "Effective Date of the Merger." The
"Effective Time of the Merger" shall be 11:59 p.m., Seattle, Washington time,
on the Effective Date of the Merger. At the Effective Time of the Merger on
the Effective Date of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Co. shall
cease and Merger Co. will be merged with and into Company pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on the Closing Date at the offices
of Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo Center, Sixth and Marquette, Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

  



  

(f) _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. At Wells Fargos election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (1) Company is merged with and
into any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo, (2)
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo is merged with
and into Company, or (3) Company is merged with and into Wells Fargo;
provided, however, that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount
or kind of consideration to be issued to Companys shareholders in the Merger
or under such alternative structure (the "Merger Consideration"), (B)
adversely affect the tax treatment of Companys shareholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration or prevent the parties from obtaining the
opinion referred to in Paragraph 6(h), or (C) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger. In the event of such election, the parties agree
to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to
reflect such election.

knowledge of the Company and each Subsidiary, threatened against Company or
any Company Subsidiary by any person with respect to the use of
any Intellectual Property or challenging or questioning the validity
or effectiveness of any license or agreement relating to such
Intellectual Property. The current use by Company and each Company
Subsidiary of the Intellectual Property does not infringe on the rights of
any person, except for such infringements which in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon Companys
ownership or use of such Intellectual Property. There are no pending claims or
charges brought by Company or any Company Subsidiary against any person with

under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending or to the best of
Wells Fargos knowledge, threatened against Wells Fargo or any Wells Fargo
Subsidiary, the result of which has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect upon Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole; to the best of Wells Fargos knowledge, there is no reasonable basis
for any such proceeding, claim or action; and to the best of Wells Fargos

any agreement, order, judgment, or decree by or with any court, governmental
authority or third party imposing any such environmental liability.

that to fail to do so could reasonably be determined to violate its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law, enter into any discussions with any
corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than Wells

common stock, any option or warrant to purchase any shares of common stock,

necessary or required (i) to terminate or amend, if requested by Wells Fargo,

the Effective Date of the Merger under contracts being entered into with
Patrick Fahey, George Brace, David Straus, Joseph Ward, Kim Brace and Bette
Floray on the date hereof shall not constitute compensation within
the meaning of such qualified and such unqualified plans, and (B) to

coverage for participants in the plans and without duplication of costs
caused by the continuation of such plans after coverage is available under
Wells Fargo plans, and (ii) to submit application to the Internal Revenue

persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transactions") and
all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are

public announcement of discussions relating to the Transactions, (y) the date
of the public announcement of the Transactions, and (z) the date of the

(i) Following the Effective Date of the Merger, Wells Fargo shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
a director or officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary (an "Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), to the same extent as
Company is obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties in Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar governing
documents of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable in the particular case and
as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to claims arising from (A)
facts or events that occurred before the Effective Time of the Merger, or (B)
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time of
the Merger. Nothing contained in this paragraph 5(m)(i) shall be deemed to
preclude the

  



  



  

29      
   



  

liquidation, consolidation, or merger of Company or any Company Subsidiary,
in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on
liability shall be deemed to survive and continue as contractual rights
notwithstanding any such liquidation or consolidation or merger; provided,
however, that in the event of liquidation or sale of substantially all of the
assets of Company, Wells Fargo shall guarantee, to the extent of the net
asset value of Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Date of
the Merger, the indemnification obligations of Company or any Company
Subsidiary to the extent of indemnification obligations of Company and the
Company Subsidiaries described above. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this paragraph 5(m)(i), nothing contained in
this Agreement shall require Wells Fargo to indemnify any person who was a
director or officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary to a greater extent
than Company or any Company Subsidiary is, as of the date of this
Agreement, required to indemnify any such person;

  



  

(ii) any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
5(m)(i), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, shall promptly notify Wells Fargo thereof, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve Wells Fargo of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding,
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time of the
Merger) (A) Wells Fargo shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Wells Fargo shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Wells Fargo elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Party advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Wells Fargo and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Wells Fargo shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements
therefor are received, provided, however, that Wells Fargo shall be obligated
pursuant to this subparagraph (ii) to pay for only one firm of counsel for
all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, and (B) such Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter;

  



  

(iii) for a period of three years after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Wells Fargo shall use its best efforts to cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by Company (provided that Wells Fargo may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amount containing terms and
conditions which are substantially no less advantageous) with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time
of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Wells Fargo be
obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage
pursuant to this paragraph 5(m)(iii), any

  



  



  

30      
   



  

amount per annum in excess of 300% of the amount of the annual premiums paid
as of the date hereof by Company for such insurance (the "Maximum Amount")
and provided further that, prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Company
shall notify the appropriate directors and officers liability insurers of
the Merger and of all pending or threatened claims, actions, suits,
proceedings or investigations asserted or claimed against any Indemnified
Party, or circumstances likely to give rise thereto to the extent known to
the Company, in accordance with terms and conditions of the
applicable policies. If the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Wells
Fargo shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Amount;

  



  

(iv) if Wells Fargo or any of its successors or assigns (A) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Wells
Fargo shall assume the obligations set forth in this paragraph 5(m); and

  



  

(v) the provisions of this paragraph 5(m) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

  



  

(n) Wells Fargo shall (i) register under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or
other appropriate form (and use its best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof) all shares of Wells Fargo Stock issuable pursuant to
the Substitute Options, (ii) cause such shares to be authorized for listing
on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange, and (iii)
reserve a sufficient number of such shares for issuance upon such exercise.

  



  

**6. Conditions Precedent to Obligation of Company.** The obligation
of Company to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction at or
before the Time of Filing of the following further conditions, which may be
waived in writing by Company:

  



  

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. Except as they may be affected
by transactions contemplated hereby and except to the extent such
representations and warranties are by their express provisions made as of a
specified date and except for activities or transactions after the date of
this Agreement made in the ordinary course of business and not expressly
prohibited by this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in
paragraph 3 hereof shall be true and correct in all respects material to
Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries taken as a whole as if made at the Time of
Filing.

  



  



  

31      
   



  

(b) _Performance of Wells Fargo Obligations_. Wells Fargo shall have, or shall
