Section 2.06 Limitation on Assignment of Purchased Assets. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute
an agreement to assign or transfer any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder
if an attempted assignment or transfer, without the consent of, or other
action by, any third party, would constitute a breach thereunder, a violation
of Applicable Law or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or Seller
or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder. If such consent is not
obtained or such other action is not taken (or any such consent or action is
required with respect to any asset of any Purchased Subsidiary), Seller and
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement (including by establishing an agency type
relationship or similar arrangement) under which Buyer would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement and the terms of any such Purchased Asset (or asset of such
Purchased Subsidiary, as applicable). Upon obtaining the requisite consents,
approvals or amendments thereto, Seller shall assign all rights associated
with such Purchased Asset to Buyer (or its designee), in each case, without
the payment of any consideration by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
agreement by any such Person to any adverse amendments, modifications or
waivers of any material terms of any Purchased Assets in order to obtain such
consents. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Seller shall (and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to) exercise, enforce and exploit, only at the
direction of and for the benefit of Buyer and at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, any and all claims, rights and benefits of such Seller arising in
connection with such Purchased Asset. During such period and without further
consideration, Seller will promptly pay, assign and remit to Buyer when
received all monies and other consideration relating to the period after the
Closing Date received by it under any Contract or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder not transferred pursuant to this Section 2.06.

Section 2.07 Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) The purchase
price for the Purchased Assets and the Shares is $260,000,000 in cash (the
"Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section
2.08 (subject to Section 2.07(b)) and shall be subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 2.11.

(a) At the Closing, an amount equal to the China Consideration shall be
converted to Chinese renminbi in accordance with Section 13.13 and thereafter
such converted amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent into the Escrow
Account. The Escrow Account shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Purchase Price and the fair market value of the Assumed Liabilities
shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets and the Shares as set forth in the
statement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Allocation Statement"), which
shall include (i) a specific allocation with respect to the Purchased Assets,
ClosetMaid Corporation and each Purchased Foreign Subsidiary and (ii) an
agreement as to the methodology that Buyer and Seller shall use to determine
the fair market value, for Canadian Tax purposes, of the Assumed Liabilities
assumed by Canadian Buyer in connection with this Agreement.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but not later than 120 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver a statement allocating the
"aggregate deemed sales price" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-4) with respect to ClosetMaid Corporation and
Clarison Inc. in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 338(h)(10), consistent with the allocation of Purchase Price set forth on the Allocation Statement, adjusted
as necessary pursuant to Section 2.07(e) (the "338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement"). If, within 20 days after the delivery of the 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to
any allocation set forth thereon, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such objection. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable
to resolve such dispute within 20 days following Seller's notification of such
objection, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee to
resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the
338(h)(10) Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution.
The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne (i) by
Seller if the Accounting Referee determines less than 50% of the allocations
in favor of Seller, (ii) by Buyer if the Accounting Referee determines less
than 50% of the allocations in favor of Buyer and (iii) by Buyer and Seller
equally if the Accounting Referee determines the allocations evenly between
Buyer and Seller.

(d) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.11 or otherwise, any adjustment shall be allocated to the shares of
ClosetMaid Corporation, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, and the
Allocation Statement (and, if applicable, the 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement)
shall be adjusted in a manner consistent therewith. If the 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement is adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.07(e), Buyer and
Seller shall file an amended IRS Form 8883 as required.

(e) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refunds) and
information reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Statement and
the 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement, absent a Final Determination that an
alternative allocation is required by Applicable Law.

Section 2.08 Closing. Subject to Section 2.12, the closing (the "Closing") of
the purchase and sale of the Shares and the Purchased Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder shall take place by electronic
exchange of documents on the third Business Day following the date upon which
all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, written waiver of
those conditions) have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waived in writing); provided however, that if the first date
on which all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
written waiver of those conditions) are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, waived in writing) is September 27, 2017 or September 28,
2017, then the Closing shall occur on September 29, 2017; provided, further,
that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, written
waiver of those conditions), the Closing shall occur on the date following
such satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of
(a) a Business Day during the Marketing Period to be specified by Buyer on no
less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company, (b) the
third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (as
it may be extended pursuant to the definition thereof) and (c) subject in all
respects to the following sentence, September 29, 2017 (in the case of this
clause (c), irrespective of whether the Marketing Period has ended), if all of
the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, written waiver of
those conditions) are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, waived in writing) on or prior to September 28, 2017. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
written waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied (or to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, waived in writing), and the Marketing Period has
not ended by September 29, 2017 due to the Seller not providing Compliant
Required Information on or before September 6, 2017, or at any time thereafter
such Required Information ceases to be Compliant, then the Closing shall take
place by electronic exchange of documents on the earlier of (i) the third
Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (as it may be
extended pursuant to the definition thereof) and (ii) a Business Day during
the Marketing Period to be specified by Buyer on no less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to Seller. The Closing (or the Deferred Closing, as
applicable) shall be deemed effective as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (or
Deferred Closing Date, as applicable) (the "Effective Time"). At the Closing,
the following transactions will occur:

(a) Buyer shall deliver:

(i) to Seller, a duly executed counterpart to each Transaction Document not
previously executed and delivered to which Buyer or any Affiliate thereof is a
party;

(ii) to Seller, an amount equal to the Purchase Price in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Seller three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing less the China Consideration; and

(iii) to the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to the China Consideration in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Escrow Account.

(b) Seller shall deliver: (i) to Buyer, a duly executed counterpart to each Transaction Document not
previously executed and delivered to which Seller or any Affiliate thereof is
a party;

(ii) to Buyer, certificates for the Shares (other than the Shares of

in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto;

(iii) or cause to be delivered, and transfer actual possession and control of,
all Purchased Assets to Buyer and its Affiliates by taking such action as may
be required, reasonably necessary or desirable, or requested by Buyer, to
effect such transfer of possession and control;

(iv) all information necessary to be delivered by Seller for the filings for
the China Approvals referred to in Section 2.12(b)(ii)(A), Section
2.12(b)(ii)(B) and Section 2.12(b)(ii)(C); and

(v) the written resignation (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer) of any director or officer or similar representative of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, for which Buyer so requests in writing at least two (2) Business
Days in advance of Closing.

Section 2.09 Foreign Transfer Agreements. The transfer of each Purchased
Foreign Subsidiary and the assignment of the Purchased Assets and assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities relating to any portion of the Business located
outside of the United States will be effected pursuant to individual short-
form acquisition agreements (each a "Foreign Transfer Agreement") on a
country-by-country basis in substantially the forms attached as Exhibit C and
Exhibit D to this Agreement, and in the case of the Canadian Business, in form
and substance to be reasonably agreed by Buyer and Seller; provided, that, in
each case, the Foreign Transfer Agreements shall serve purely to effect the
legal transfer of the applicable Purchased Foreign Subsidiary or the
assignment of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Foreign Transfer Agreements
shall not have any effect on the value being given or received by Seller or
Buyer, including the allocation of assets and Liabilities as between them, all
of which shall be determined solely in accordance with this Agreement and (i)
in the event of any conflicts between any Foreign Transfer Agreement and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control in all respects. Seller
and Buyer shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, bring
any claim for any cause of action under any Foreign Transfer Agreement, except
that the parties thereto may bring any claim for any cause of action expressly
provided for therein.

Section 2.10 Closing Statement. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later
than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth
Buyer's good faith calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses.

(b) If Seller disagrees with Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses delivered pursuant to Section
2.10(a), Seller may, within 60 days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
deliver a written notice to Buyer (a "Dispute Notice") disagreeing with such
calculation and which specifies Seller's good faith calculation of Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, and, in
reasonable detail, specifying Seller's grounds for each point of disagreement.
The Dispute Notice shall specify those items or amounts as to which Seller
disagrees (each, a "Disputed Item"), and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement (i) absent
fraud or (ii) unless Seller disputes such items or amounts in a Dispute Notice
within the 60-day period after delivery of the Closing Statement.

(c) If Seller duly delivers a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall, during
the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on each Disputed Item in order to determine the amount of
Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such period, they
shall promptly (and, in any event, within 45 days following delivery of the
Dispute Notice) thereafter jointly retain a nationally recognized accounting
firm, who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or Seller (the
"Accounting Referee") and cause such Accounting Referee promptly to review
this Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of calculating Closing
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses (it being
understood that in making such determination, the Accounting Referee shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such
calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only the Disputed Items,
and shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement (including the definitions)
and the Accounting Policies. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and
Seller, as promptly as practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days
of its retention), a written report setting forth the calculation of each
Disputed Item and the resulting Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and Transaction Expenses in reasonable detail. Such report shall be final and
binding upon Buyer and Seller (absent fraud). The cost of such review and
report shall be borne (i) by Seller if Seller is awarded less than 50% of the
aggregate value of all Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee, (i)
by Buyer if Buyer is awarded less than 50% of the aggregate value of all
Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee and (i) otherwise equally
by Buyer and Seller.

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and in the conduct of the reviews
referred to in this Section 2.10, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, final drafts of work papers and personnel during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice to the extent reasonably necessary to verify
the accuracy of the Closing Statement; provided, however, that Buyer and
Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to, use
or permit to be used such information other than for purposes of this Section
2.10, and shall not disclose or permit to be disclosed any information
reviewed except as required by Applicable Law or legal process, and it shall
be a condition to the granting of such access to any work papers that Seller
and its Representatives execute any confidentiality agreements, releases, and
indemnity agreements customarily required by Buyer's accountants for such
access.

Section 2.11 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

(a) As an adjustment to the Purchase Price, (i) if (A) the Closing Working
Capital Target exceeds (B) Final Closing Working Capital minus Final Closing
Indebtedness minus Transaction Expenses, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, in
the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.11(b), the amount of
such excess, and (b) if (A) Final Closing Working Capital minus Final Closing
Indebtedness minus Transaction Expenses exceeds (B) the Closing Working
Capital Target, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.11(b), the amount of such excess. The "Final
Closing Working Capital", "Final Closing Indebtedness" and "Final Transaction
Expenses" means Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses, respectively, (x) as set forth in the Closing Statement, if Seller
does not duly deliver a Dispute Notice or (y) if a Dispute Notice is delivered
(A) as agreed between Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or (A) in
the absence of such agreement, as determined by the Accounting Referee
pursuant to Section 2.10(c); provided, that in no event shall Closing Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses be more than the higher
value thereof proposed by either Seller or Buyer or less than the lower value
thereof proposed by either Seller or Buyer, in each case, as set forth in the
Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice, respectively.

(b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall accrue interest pursuant
to Section 2.14 and shall be made by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at a
mutually convenient time within three Business Days after the determination of
Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Indebtedness and Final
Transaction Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of such other party as may be designated by such other
party.

Section 2.12 Deferred Closing.

(a) The closing (the "Deferred Closing") of the purchase and sale of the
equity interests in ClosetMaid China (the "Deferred Business"), shall not take
place at the Closing and shall instead take place on the third Business Day
following the date upon which all of the conditions set forth in Section
2.12(b) are satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Section 2.12(b), waived in writing. For the avoidance
of doubt, for all purposes of determining the payments to be made pursuant to
Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, the Deferred Closing shall be deemed to have
occurred on the Closing Date.

(b) The obligations of Buyer and Seller to consummate the Deferred Closing
shall be subject to the satisfaction (or with respect to the condition set
forth in Section 2.12(b)(i), to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived
in writing by both Seller and Buyer) at or prior to the Deferred Closing Date,
of each of the following conditions:

(i) no Order (in any jurisdiction where the Deferred Business conducts
substantial operations) shall prohibit the consummation of the Deferred
Closing; and

(ii) the following recordals and approvals (collectively, the "China
Approvals") shall have been obtained or completed:

(A) SAIC shall have updated the company registration information of ClosetMaid
China and issued a recordal receipt showing Buyer or its designated Affiliate
as the sole owner of the entire equity interests in ClosetMaid China;

(B) MOFCOM shall have issued a recordal receipt showing Buyer or its
designated Affiliate as the sole owner of the entire equity interests in
ClosetMaid China;

(C) ClosetMaid China shall have updated its foreign exchange registration with
respect to the change of sole owner of ClosetMaid China to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate; and

(D) Emerson China shall have opened a Renminbi equity transfer special bank
account (人民币股权转让专用存款账户) in China to receive the China Consideration.

(c) At the Deferred Closing, Seller and Buyer shall jointly execute and
deliver an irrevocable written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing it
to release the China Consideration in the Escrow Account to Emerson China by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Renminbi equity transfer
special bank account (人民币股权转让专用存款账户) opened by Emerson China for receipt of
the China Consideration.

Section 2.13 Obligations with Respect to the Deferred Closing.

(a) Immediately following the Closing Date (and in any event within one
Business Day thereof), Buyer and Seller will make, or will cause to be made,
the filings for the China Approvals referred to in Section 2.12(b)(ii)(A). The
Parties will make, or cause to be made, all other filings for the China
Approvals as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date.

(b) With respect to the Deferred Business, from the Closing Date until the
Deferred Closing Date, the Deferred Business shall be held for the account of
Buyer, and Buyer and Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement
under which Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates) would obtain the
benefits, assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens (including any
liability for Deferred Closing Period Taxes) associated with operating the
Deferred Business; provided that, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to make any investment in, or to make any loan or other capital
contribution to, the Deferred Business; provided, further, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not entitle Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to the benefit of any payments (including under any "cost-plus"
arrangement) made by Buyer or its Affiliates to Seller or its Affiliates,
whether under the Transition Services Agreement or otherwise, in respect of
the operation thereof. From and after the Closing Date through the Deferred
Closing Date, Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
(i) to conduct the Deferred Business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and in accordance with the Deferred Business Budget and
Applicable Law, and use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact the
Deferred Business and maintain its existing relations and goodwill with
Governmental Authorities, customers, suppliers, creditors, employees, lessors
and agents and (ii) not to, without the prior written consent of Buyer: (A)
incur or assume any Liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (B) cause or permit ClosetMaid China to
directly or indirectly take any of the actions set forth on Exhibit H or (C)
take any action described in Section 5.01(a) through Section 5.01(t) with
respect to the Deferred Business; provided that Seller shall not have any
liability under this Section 2.13(b) for any fact, matter, event or
circumstance caused directly or indirectly by an employee of Buyer or an
employee of the Deferred Business, in each case, at the direction or
instruction of Buyer or its Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not be liable for the Deferred Business Budget
or the failure of the Deferred Business to meet projections or estimates used
to prepare the Deferred Business Budget.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.13(a), from and after the
Closing Date until the Deferred Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates, to the extent necessary, to fund the ongoing operations of the
Deferred Business (including any liability for Deferred Closing Period Taxes)
as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion (subject to the final sentence
of this Section 2.13(c)) (the "China Operating Expenses"), it being agreed and
understood that Buyer may direct Seller to utilize any cash of the Deferred
Business to be utilized to pay any such China Operating Expenses (including
any liability for Deferred Closing Period Taxes). For the avoidance of doubt,
the China Operating Expenses shall be without duplication of any amounts
payable under the Transition Services Agreement. Buyer shall fund any China Operating Expenses at Seller\'s request if, in the reasonable
opinion of Seller, based on the advice of outside counsel, failure to do so
would reasonably be likely to prevent or impair the consummation of the
Deferred Closing.

(d) The parties have agreed that concurrently with the filing for the China
Approvals referred to in Section 2.12(b)(ii)(A), Section 2.12(b)(ii)(B) and
Section 2.12(b)(ii)(C), the parties shall procure that the legal
representative, directors, supervisor and general manager of ClosetMaid China
("Appointees") shall be changed to such persons as are designated by Buyer.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.13(d) will alter Buyer's
and Seller's obligations with respect to the operation of the Deferred
Business pursuant to Section 2.13(a).

(e) Without limiting Buyer's obligations under Section 7.01, but subject to
the terms thereof, from the Closing Date until the Deferred Closing (if
applicable), Buyer shall, and shall cause the Appointees to, execute and
deliver all documents, certificates, agreements or other writings, and take
such other actions as Seller may reasonably request in furtherance of the
transfer of the equity interests in ClosetMaid China, including affixing the
company chop on all applications and other documents which relate to the China
Approvals.

(f) For Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law and
except for Buyer's responsibility for Deferred Closing Period Taxes, ownership
of the Deferred Business will be considered to transfer from Seller or the
applicable Retained Subsidiary to Buyer on the applicable Deferred Closing
Date.

(g) From and after the Closing Date until the Deferred Closing Date, the
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to,
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising with respect
to the Deferred Business at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable
best efforts and cooperation include (i) keeping each other appropriately
informed of communications from and to personnel of the reviewing Governmental
Authorities and (ii) conferring with each other regarding appropriate contacts
with and response to personnel of such Governmental Authorities and the
content of any such contacts or presentations, in each case with respect to
any material matter. Neither Seller nor Buyer nor any of their respective
Representatives shall participate in any material meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice of the
meeting or discussion and the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting or discussion.

Section 2.14 Payments. Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.02(f), any
amount required to be paid under this Agreement that is not paid within the
period specified for such payment shall bear interest on a daily basis, from
and including the date such payment was required to be made hereunder, to but
excluding the date of payment, at a rate per annum equal to the rate of
interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time as its
prime rate in effect at its office located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York in effect from time
to time during the period from the date such payment was required to be made
hereunder, to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same
time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 2.15 Withholding. Each of Buyer and Seller, and their respective
Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable hereunder, or other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or
any provision of any United States federal, state, local or foreign Tax law;
provided that (i) at least five days before any payment is made under this
Agreement, the party making such payment shall notify the party entitled to
receive the payment of any deduction or withholding requirement applicable to
the payment of which the withholding party becomes aware, and (ii) the parties
shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, and shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect to which
such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.16 Philippines Deferred Assets. Title to the Purchased Assets listed
in Section 2.16 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Philippines Deferred Assets")
shall not pass to Buyer on Closing. Buyer and Seller irrevocably agree that
title to the Philippines Deferred Assets shall pass to Buyer as of the
Applicable Transfer Time in respect of the Philippines Employees (the
"Philippines Deferred Closing") (it being agreed that Seller and its
Affiliates are being fully compensated for the Philippines Deferred Assets at
Closing and no further consideration shall be payable by Buyer or its
Affiliates in respect of the Philippines Deferred Assets at the Applicable
Transfer Time). For the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes of determining
the payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.10 and Section 2.11, the
Philippines Deferred Closing shall be deemed to have occurred on the Closing
Date. From the Closing until the Philippines Deferred Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, operate and maintain the Philippines
Deferred Assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (ordinary wear and tear excepted), and, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, will not take any applicable action in Section 5.01(a)
through Section 5.01(t) with respect to the Philippines Deferred Assets.

Assuming due and valid execution and delivery by each other party thereto,
each other Transaction Document to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a

such Affiliate, enforceable against Seller or such Affiliate in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

performance by Seller and its Affiliates of this Agreement and the other

bound, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
Purchased Asset or on any asset of any Purchased Subsidiary, except for any

the aggregate, material to the Business.

result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Purchased Subsidiary and its
jurisdiction of organization is identified on Section 3.05(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. Except for the Business, none of the Purchased

to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS or has applied to the IRS for
such a letter within the applicable remedial amendment period or such period
has not expired and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualification of such Business Benefit Plan or the tax
exempt status of the related trust. Each Business Benefit Plan (other than a
Title IV Plan) has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance in
all material respects with its terms and Applicable Law.

(d) There are no pending audits or investigations by any Governmental
Authority involving any Business Benefit Plan (other than a Title IV Plan),
and no pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened claims (except for
individual claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of such
Business Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings involving any Business Benefit
Plan (other than a Title IV Plan), any fiduciary thereof or service provider
thereto, nor to Seller's knowledge is there any reasonable basis for any such

Seller's knowledge, any fiduciary, trustee or administrator of any Business
Benefit Plan (other than a Title IV Plan), has engaged in, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will engage in, any
transaction with respect to any such Business Benefit Plan which would subject

Affiliates or Buyer to a Tax, penalty or Liability for a "prohibited
transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

(f) Neither the execution of, nor the performance of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will either alone or in connection with any
other event(s) (i) result in any payment becoming due to any Business Employee
under any Business Benefit Plan (other than a Title IV Plan), (ii) increase
any amount of compensation or benefits otherwise payable under any Business

amend or terminate any Purchased Subsidiary Benefit Plan.

contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or when combined with the
occurrence of any other event, including without limitation, a termination of
employment) will result in the receipt or retention by any person who is a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Code Section 280G) of any
payment or benefit that is or could be characterized as a "parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Code Section 280G), determined without regard to the
application of Code Section 280G(b)(5).

(h) Each Business Benefit Plan that constitutes a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, complies in
all material respects in both form and operation with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code so that no amount paid pursuant to any such Business
Benefit Plan is subject to tax under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) No Purchased Subsidiary Benefit Plan provides any current employee,
officer, director or independent contractor of the Business with any "gross
up" or reimbursement for any Taxes.

(j) Each International Plan has obtained from the Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction with respect to such plan any required determinations that
such plan is in compliance with the laws and regulations of any such
Governmental Authority. The assets of each International Plan that is a
Purchased Subsidiary Benefit Plan and which is an employee pension benefit
plan as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA) or
otherwise provides retirement, medical or life insurance benefits following
retirement or other termination of service or employment are at least equal to
the liabilities of such plan (determined based on reasonable actuarial
assumptions).

States, the Seller, Purchased Subsidiaries, and Retained Subsidiaries, as

with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with

by each other party hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Assuming due and valid execution and
delivery by each other party thereto, each other Transaction Document to which

and binding agreement of Buyer or such Affiliate, enforceable against Buyer or
such Affiliate in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions.

Section 4.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer and its Affiliates of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which any of Buyer and its Affiliates is a party and

Buyer and its Affiliates of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document
to which any of Buyer and its Affiliates is a party and the consummation of

exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not

any other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a
party.

Section 4.05 Financing.

(a) Attached hereto as Exhibit E and Exhibit F, respectively, are true and
complete copies of (a) an executed commitment letter to the Buyer (the "Equity Commitment Letter") from Griffon to provide equity financing, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, for the transactions contemplated hereby in the
cash amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"), and (b) an executed
commitment letter to Buyer from Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch (the
"Lender") and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. pursuant to which the Lender has
committed to provide Buyer with financing for the transactions contemplated
hereby, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, in the aggregate amount
set forth therein (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity
Financing, the "Financing") (including any related fee letters or side letters
that include any conditions to the Financing, provided that any such fee
letters or side letters are subject to customary redaction by Buyer and/or the
Lender to omit the fee amounts (the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together
with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters"). Each Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to Buyer's
knowledge, of each of the other parties thereto, and is in full force and
effect and enforceable against Buyer, and to Buyer's knowledge, each other
party thereto (except in each case as the same may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general
equitable principles). There are no side letters or other Contracts to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than (i) as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letters and (ii) customary engagement letter(s), fee letters
(relating to fees with respect to the Financing) and non-disclosure
agreement(s) which do not impact the conditionality or materially impact the
aggregate amount of the Financing available to fund the Purchase Price. Buyer
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees that are required
by the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or prior to the date
hereof. No Commitment Letter has been amended, restated or otherwise modified
or waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and, to the knowledge of Buyer,
no commitment contained in any Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, modified
or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. Buyer is not,
and to the knowledge of Buyer, none of the Financing Sources are, in default
or breach of the terms of any Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, there
are no conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of any Financing other than as described in the applicable
Commitment Letter. Assuming (i) the closing conditions set forth in Section
10.01 and Section 10.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied simultaneously with the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions at such time) and
compliance in all material respects by the Seller with its obligations under
Section 7.01, and (ii) the funding in full of the Financing on the Closing
Date, Buyer shall have at the Closing sufficient cash to enable it to make
payment of the Purchase Price and any other amounts to be paid by it hereunder
and in connection with the Financing.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, but subject in all respects to Section 13.08
(including the limitations set forth therein), neither the availability of
financing or the consummation of any financing transaction shall be a condition to the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and (ii) as of the date hereof,
it has received the Required Information and knows of no fact or omission
therefrom that would render the Required Information to not be Compliant.

Section 4.06 Limited Guarantee . Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller a duly executed Limited Guarantee by
Griffon. The Limited Guarantee in the form so delivered is in full force and
effect and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Griffon, enforceable
against Griffon in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors'
rights generally and general equitable principles. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Griffon under such Limited Guarantee.

Section 4.07 Litigation. There are no Actions pending against or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened against, Buyer, except for such Actions as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party.

Section 4.08 Finders' Fees. Except for Goldman Sachs and Co., LLC, whose fees
and expenses shall be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to
act on behalf of Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

Section 4.09 Inspections; No Other Representations. Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the Purchased Assets
and the Shares as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such
investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Purchased Assets and
the Shares are sold "as is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Purchased Assets
and the Business in the condition they are in on the Closing Date based on its
own inspection, examination and determination with respect to all matters, and
without reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of
any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or in any
certificate delivered by Seller in accordance with the terms hereof or
thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to
(i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to
Buyer or its Representatives of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) of the Business or the future business and
operations of the Business or (ii) except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or in any certificate delivered
by Seller in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, any other
information or documents made available to Buyer or its Representatives with
respect to the Business.

Section 4.10 Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Shares for
investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, except such views that would not
cause Buyer to be considered an "underwriter" within the meaning of the
Securities Act. Buyer (either alone or together with its advisors) has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares
and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment.

Section 4.11 Canadian Tax. Prior to the Closing, Canadian Buyer will be
registered for purposes of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and, to the
extent relevant and applicable, An Act Respecting the Quebec Sales Tax.

of the Business, the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Purchased Assets; provided
that Seller shall not assign any of its rights to any non-solicitation and no-
hire provisions included in any potential buyer confidentiality agreement
solely to the extent they relate to employees who are not Business Employees.
Promptly following the Closing Date, Seller will send a letter in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer to the potential buyers of the Business that
entered into confidentiality agreements with Seller, authorizing Buyer to
recover all information (as defined in such agreements) or requesting
certification of its destruction to Buyer in each case in accordance with the
terms of such agreements.

Section 5.03 Noncompetition. (a) Seller agrees that during the five (5) year
period commencing on the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
controlled Affiliates shall, anywhere in the world, either directly or
indirectly, as a stockholder, investor, member, partner, or otherwise, own,
manage, operate, set up or engage in any business that competes with the
Business as the Business is conducted on the Closing Date (a "Competing
Business"); provided that nothing herein shall prohibit (x) the acquisition by
Seller or any of its Affiliates of all or any portion of a Competing Business
(the "Acquired Competing Business"); provided that, except with respect to any
Permitted Holding, promptly (and in any event, within twenty (20) Business
Days) following such acquisition, Seller shall offer in writing to sell the
Acquired Competing Business to Buyer or its Affiliates and, if Buyer notifies
Seller in writing within thirty (30) days of such offer that Buyer or its
Affiliates have a good faith interest in acquiring the Acquired Competing
Business (which notice shall propose a price (the "ROFO Price") for the
Acquired Competing Business), and, if Seller determines to accept the offer to
sell the Acquired Competing Business at the ROFO Price, the parties shall in
good faith negotiate the terms of a sale to be completed within sixty (60)
days following the delivery of such written notice by Buyer (the "ROFO
Period"); provided, further that if Buyer and Seller (or their respective
Affiliates) have not executed and delivered a definitive agreement for the
acquisition of the Acquired Competing Business on or prior to the end of the
ROFO Period, Seller and its Affiliates must thereafter use reasonable best
efforts to sell the Acquired Competing Business to an unaffiliated third party
for a purchase price that is equal to or greater than the ROFO Price by the
date that is twelve (12) months following the end of the ROFO Period (such end
date, the "Mandatory Sale Start Date") and may not, without the Buyer's prior
written consent, during such twelve (12) month period, sell the Acquired
Competing Business to any third party for a purchase price that is less than
the ROFO Price; provided, further that if Seller and its Affiliates have not
completed the sale of the Acquired Competing Business for a price equal to or
greater than the ROFO Price to an unaffiliated third party on or prior to the
Mandatory Sale Start Date, Seller shall deliver written notice to Buyer,
informing Buyer that Buyer has a sixty (60) days period during which it may elect, in
its sole discretion, to purchase the Acquired Competing Business at the ROFO
Price and, within sixty (60) days following such written notice by Buyer,
Seller and its Affiliates irrevocably agree to sell the Acquired Competing
Business to the Buyer or its Affiliates for the ROFO Price and on such other
terms as the parties may reasonably agree (the Mandatory Sale Start Date until
the date of the consummation of such sale, the "Mandatory Sale Period") or (y)
the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect ownership by
Seller or any of its Affiliates of any voting stock, capital stock or other
equity interest for passive investment purposes of any Person engaged in a
Competing Business, so long as such ownership, in the aggregate, represents
not more than 5% of the aggregate voting power or outstanding capital stock or
other equity interests of such Person (the "Permitted Holding"). During the
Mandatory Sale Period, the provisions of Section 5.09 shall apply to the
Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Acquired Competing Business
mutatis mutandis, with the "Exclusivity Period" deemed to be the Mandatory
Sale Period. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, the
foregoing shall not, in any way, limit or effect Seller's ability to operate
the Deferred Business in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
herein or perform its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement.
This Section 5.03 shall cease to be applicable to any Person at such time as
it is no longer a Subsidiary of Seller and shall not apply to any Person that
purchases assets, operations or a business from Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries, if such Person is not a Subsidiary of Seller after such
transaction is consummated.

(b) Seller acknowledges that: (i) Seller's obligations under this Section 5.03
and Section 5.04 are reasonable in the context of the nature of the Business
and the competitive injuries likely to be sustained by the Business and Buyer
if Seller or any of its Affiliates were to violate such obligations; (i) the
covenants in this Section 5.03 and Section 5.04 are adequately supported by
consideration from Buyer for the benefit of Seller and necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of Buyer and the Business; (i) the foregoing
makes it necessary for the protection of the Business and Buyer that Seller
uphold Seller's obligations under this Section 5.03 and Section 5.04 for the
reasonable time period contained herein and therein; and (iv) Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement absent Seller's agreement to the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.03 and Section 5.04. If any provision in this
Section 5.03 or Section 5.04 shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Section 5.03 or Section 5.04,
but this Section 5.03 or Section 5.04, as applicable, shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained
herein or therein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein or therein are held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section
5.03 or Section 5.04, as applicable to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein or therein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such Applicable Law.

(c) Seller agrees that it would be impossible to measure in money the damages
Buyer and the Business would suffer for any breach by Seller of any of the
provisions of this Section 5.03 and Section 5.04. Accordingly, Seller agrees
that if Buyer or any of its Affiliates institute any action or proceeding to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.03 or Section 5.04, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.03 and Section 5.04, in accordance
with Section 13.08.

(d) Seller agrees and intends that the obligations contained in this Section
5.03 and Section 5.04 be tolled during any period that Seller or any of its
Affiliates is in breach of any of the obligations in this Section 5.03 or
Section 5.04, so that Buyer and each of its Affiliates are provided with the
full benefit of the restrictive periods set forth herein and therein.

Section 5.04 Non-solicit. For a period of 24 months following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, (a)
directly or indirectly solicit or recruit (or cause to be directly or
indirectly solicited or recruited) for employment or hire or employ any
officer who works for the Business, or any Person who reports to the President
of the Business and any direct report to the President of the Business (any
such employee, a "Covered Employee") or (b) induce or otherwise counsel,
advise or encourage any Covered Employee to terminate their employment or
engagement with Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided, that the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to (i) generalized searches for employees through
media advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms, online
job boards, open job fairs or other similar means which are not specifically
targeted at such Covered Employees or (ii) (A) any Covered Employee whose
employment is terminated by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any
Purchased Subsidiary) or (B) with respect to any Covered Employee who
voluntarily ceases employment with Buyer or its Affiliates (including any
Purchased Subsidiary), the restriction in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B)
shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the date that is 24 months
following the Closing Date and (y) the date that is six months following the
cessation of such Covered Employee's employment with Buyer or its Affiliates
(including any Purchased Subsidiary).

Section 5.05 Termination of Intercompany Arrangements. On or prior to Closing,
Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to (a) terminate any Contract
between a Purchased Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller or any Retained
Subsidiary, on the other hand, except for any outstanding purchase orders,
those items listed in Section 5.05 of the Disclosure Schedule and for any
Contracts or purchase orders between the Business, on the one hand, and any other operating
business of Seller or any Retained Subsidiary, on the other hand, entered into
in the ordinary course of business and listed in Section 5.05 of the
Disclosure Schedule, (b) eliminate any Indebtedness owed by Seller or any
Retained Subsidiary to a Purchased Subsidiary or the Business, (c) repay or
otherwise eliminate any Indebtedness owed by a Purchased Subsidiary or the
Business to Seller or any Retained Subsidiary and (d) not before the
consummation of the Closing, terminate any insurance policy, or portion
thereof, covering the Business that is held by Seller or a Retained
Subsidiary, provided that this clause (d) with respect to any insurance policy
relating to the Deferred Business must be satisfied no earlier than the
Deferred Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any costs, expenses, Tax, Liabilities or obligations that arise as a result of
or in connection with the settlement or elimination of intercompany
arrangements pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be borne solely by Seller,
and Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer against such costs, expenses, Taxes,
Liabilities or obligations and any related losses.

Section 5.06 Real Estate Matters. From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller shall and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Buyer in obtaining, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, (i) an
irrevocable commitment to issue an ALTA extended coverage form of owner's
policy of title insurance (including all endorsements reasonably requested by
Buyer) from the Title Company, dated as of the date reasonably proximate to
(but in no event earlier than) the Closing Date and in amounts reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, committing to insure good and marketable fee simple
title to each parcel of Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Liens located in the United States, and (ii) an ALTA survey for
each parcel of Owned Real Property located in the United States from a
licensed surveyor dated as of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date
and certified to the applicable Purchased Subsidiary, Buyer, Buyer's lenders,
and the Title Company; provided, however, such cooperation shall be at no
cost, expense, or liability to Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, and shall not
include the delivery of any indemnification agreement to the Title Company.

Section 5.07 Intellectual Property. Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date,
take reasonable steps, at Seller's sole cost and expense, to resolve any break
in the chain of title, recordation error and any other related ownership
issues with respect to any Registered Intellectual Property Rights included in
the Business Intellectual Property Rights, in each case, that are set forth in
Section 5.07 of the Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall take such reasonable steps and actions, at Seller's and Buyer's equal
(i.e., 50:50) cost and expense for the first six (6) months following the
Closing Date and thereafter at Buyer's sole cost and expense, to resolve any
break in chain of title, recordation error and other related ownership issues
arising prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Registered Intellectual
Property Rights included in the Business Intellectual Property Rights
(provided, however, any cost and expense for the recordation of the assignment
of the Assigned IP Assets from Seller or any Retained Subsidiary to Buyer or
its designee shall be at the sole cost and expense of Buyer.) Buyer's legal counsel shall
be responsible for primarily coordinating and leading the resolution of the
issues mentioned in the foregoing sentence.

Section 5.08 Financing. (a) Seller and the Purchased Subsidiaries shall, and
shall request their respective Representatives to, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer and its

of the Debt Financing (or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing), including, without limitation, (i) representatives of
the Business participating in a reasonable number of meetings and due
diligence sessions at reasonable times, on reasonable advance notice and at

documents required in connection with the Debt Financing (collectively, the
"Offering Materials") and Seller and the Purchased Subsidiaries agree that

its marks, (iv) cooperating in and assisting with the preparation of any

(vi) providing authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the

the Business or the Shares, (vii) Representatives of the Business executing

reimburse Seller or the Purchased Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller, the
Purchased Subsidiaries, its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with
such cooperation.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), from the date hereof
until the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer within forty-five (45) days
of the end of any fiscal quarter ending after the date hereof (other than any
fiscal quarter that ends on the same date as any fiscal year), (x) unaudited

neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (1) enter into

ARTICLE 6 
COVENANTS OF BUYER

Buyer agrees that:

Section 6.01 Confidentiality. All information provided or made available to
Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to
any of the Transaction Documents or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated thereby, whether provided prior to or after the date hereof,
shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate at the Closing; provided, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect following the Closing in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, solely to the extent with
respect to (a) any Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) that relates to Seller, the Retained Subsidiaries and the Retained
Business and (b) Purchaser's (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
its controlled Affiliates' obligations in Section 4(b) of the Confidentiality
Agreement, except, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Business
Employees. If this Agreement is terminated, for any reason, prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

Section 6.02 Buyer's Financing. (a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include litigation) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to arrange the Financing in a timely manner on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and to consummate the
Financing on or prior to the Closing Date, including the following:

(i) maintaining in effect each Commitment Letter and not permitting any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replacing, each Commitment Letter, if such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid
or materially increasing the original issue discount of the Financing) or (B)
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (2)
make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to any Commitment
Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (provided that, in
any event, Buyer may (x) modify the terms of the Financing so long as such
modifications would not adversely impact the ability of Buyer to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) amend the Debt
Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or
similar entities which had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof, as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter);

(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to the availability of the
Financing within its control;

(iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Financing documentation that
reflects the terms contained in the applicable Commitment Letter (including,
with respect to the Debt Financing, any "market flex" provisions related
thereto);

(iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 and 10.02
and the conditions to the availability of the Financing have been satisfied
or, upon funding would be satisfied, causing the Financing Sources to fund the
full amount of the Financing at or prior to the Closing; and

(v) enforcing its rights under each Commitment Letter (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include litigation).

(b) At the written request of the Seller from time to time, Buyer shall keep
the Seller informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice of (i) any
material breach or repudiation (or any other breach that could adversely affect the timely
availability of the Financing) by any party to any Commitment Letter of which
Buyer becomes aware or (ii) Buyer becoming aware that all or any portion of
the Financing becoming unavailable for any reason (a "Financing Failure
Event"). Without limiting Buyer's other obligations under this Section 6.02,
if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify the
Seller of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient to make the payments
required to be made at and immediately after the Closing and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, on terms that are not less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Buyer than the Financing contemplated by the applicable
Commitment Letter and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and
when obtained, provide the Business and the Seller with a copy of, a
replacement financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing.

Section 6.03 Environmental Pollution Legal Liability Insurance. At or prior to
Closing, Buyer shall purchase an environmental pollution legal liability
insurance policy (the "PLL Policy") from Chubb or other carrier with an AM
Best rating of not less than A-VII unless otherwise agreed in writing by
Seller, which policy shall have a term of no less than five years, a
deductible or self-insured retention of $100,000 or less and individual and
aggregate limits of at least $10 million. To the extent provided under such
policy, such PLL Policy shall cover on- and off-site cleanup and third-party
bodily injury and property damage (including natural resource damage) with
respect to the covered locations specified in the PLL Policy including the
sites listed on Section 6.03 of the Disclosure Schedule, and related defense
costs; provided, it shall not be a breach of this covenant if such policy does
not provide such coverage for the real properties or facilities listed on
Section 1.01(d) of the Disclosure Schedule. Buyer shall cause the PLL Policy
to list this Agreement as an insured contract. Buyer or its designated
Affiliate shall be the "first named insured", the Purchased Subsidiaries shall
be, to the extent possible, "named insureds" and, at Seller's request, the
Seller shall be an "additional insured", each under the PLL Policy (or any
renewal, replacement or extension thereof). Payment of the premium for the PLL
Policy shall be for Buyer's account. Buyer will provide evidence to Seller of
the binding of the PLL Policy at or before Closing and a copy of the final PLL
Policy as soon as practicable thereafter.

Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections as such
Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under the HSR Act or (y)
by any domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in any Action challenging
such transactions as violative of the HSR Act, in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any
Order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.02 Certain Filings. Buyer and Seller shall, without any further
consideration, cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any

obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, (ii) in taking such actions, including executing and
delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered) all instruments,

issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, but
only following consultation with the other party to the extent practicable,
issue such public disclosure as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange to which the
disclosing party is subject; provided, further, however that prior written
consent is not required if such press release or public statement is
substantially consistent with prior public statements or press releases made
in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 7.04 Notices of Certain Events. (a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly notify the other party of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Transaction Documents if the failure to
obtain such consent would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;

(ii) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Transaction
Documents; and

(iii) the commencement of any Action that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to, in the case
of Seller, Section 3.10 (unless such Action would constitute an Excluded
Liability) or, in the case of Buyer, Section 4.07.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) notice of any matter
in this Section 7.04 shall in no way whatsoever alter a Person's rights under
Article 11 and (ii) a party's failure to comply with this Section 7.04 shall
not provide the other party hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates
with a right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Liabilities for the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice and any
applicable penalties under the WARN Act or any similar Applicable Law for any "employment loss" (as
defined under the WARN Act or any similar Applicable Law) or similar event
occurring (i) after the Closing as a result of the termination by Seller of
any Business Employee to whom Buyer was required to make a Qualifying Offer
but failed to do so (and who does not become an employee of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries within one (1) Business Day of the termination by Seller) or
(ii) for terminations or reductions in hours effected by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing. Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for all
Liabilities incurred by Buyer for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Section 7.05, and Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for all Liabilities

(90) day period immediately preceding the Closing Date, and for each such
employee, sets forth (a) his or her employer, (b) the date of such
termination, layoff or reduction in hours and (c) the location to which the
employee was assigned.



Section 7.06 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege. (a) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees
to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out
of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Representation"), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder,
officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving or relating to, and
solely to the extent involving or relating to, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by
any legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including any Purchased Subsidiary, in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(the "Current Representation").

(b) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to waive and to not
assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
and following the Closing, with any Purchased Subsidiary, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client
privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by
Seller; provided, that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgment of retention
shall not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and
their advisors.

(c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) agrees that no communications (including
email or other written communications) subject to attorney-client privilege in
connection with the Current Representation shall be subject to disclosure,
directly or indirectly, to Buyer or any Person acting on behalf of Buyer, and
the Purchased Subsidiaries shall, without the necessity of further
documentation of transfer, be deemed to have irrevocably assigned and
transferred to Seller the attorney-client privilege and expectation of client
confidence with respect to all such communications, and all books and records
and other documents of the Purchased Subsidiaries containing any such advice,
communication or other materials, and the same shall be controlled by Seller
and shall not be claimed by, and no copies shall be retained by, Buyer or any
Purchased Subsidiary.

(d) Nothing in this Section is intended to or shall be deemed to operate as a
waiver of any applicable privilege or protection that could be asserted to
prevent disclosure of any confidential communication by any legal counsel
currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates, including any
Purchased Subsidiary.

(e) Seller and Buyer agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to take, all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this
Section 7.06.

Section 7.07 Business/Non-Business Assets. In the event that at any time, or
from time to time after the Closing Date, Seller on the one hand or Buyer on
the other (or any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchased
Subsidiaries in the case of Buyer) shall receive or otherwise possess any
asset (including cash) that should belong to another Person pursuant to this
Agreement, such Person shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred,
such asset to the Person so entitled thereto at no cost to the requesting
party (subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 7.07). In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer undertakes and agrees to return any Non-
Business Assets and any other assets that are not Purchased Assets that are
owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates and are transferred to Buyer at or
after the Closing (through failure to transfer such assets out of the
Purchased Subsidiaries or otherwise) and to forward or remit to Seller any
payments received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on account of any Non-
Business Asset, and Seller undertakes and agrees to forward and remit to Buyer
any payment on account of any Purchased Asset, including any accounts or notes
receivable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assets that are transferred
with the Purchased Subsidiaries at the Closing or thereafter (through failure
to transfer such assets out of the Purchased Subsidiaries) that constitute
Non-Business Assets shall be transferred to the Seller at the sole cost and
expense of the Seller, and, to the extent any such assets were set forth on
the Balance Sheet, Seller shall remit as a condition to such transfer to Buyer
the amount Buyer paid with respect to such asset. Prior to any such transfer, the Person
receiving or possessing such asset shall hold such asset in trust for such
other Person.

Section 7.08 Access to Information; Cooperation. (a) From and after the date
hereof until the Closing Date (or the Deferred Closing Date) (or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement), and subject to Applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreement, Seller shall (and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates and their respective Representatives to) during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) give Buyer, its counsel and other
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the properties, books,
records, assets, Business Employees, facilities, Contracts and data of Seller,
its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased Subsidiaries) and their respective
Representatives which are Related to the Business, (i) furnish to Buyer, its
counsel and other authorized Representatives such financial and operating data
and other information Relating to the Business as such Persons may reasonably
request and (i) instruct the employees, independent accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives of Seller to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and its Representatives in its investigation of the Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its agents shall not have access (A)
to any properties of the Business, including the Purchased Assets and Real
Property, for purposes of conducting any sampling or other invasive

groundwater, building materials or other environmental media, (A) to any
information to the extent relating to any Retained Business or (A) any Seller
Tax Records.

reasonably necessary to permit Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates to
comply with their financial reporting, accounting or auditing obligations with
respect to any period ending before the Closing Date, (b) solely to the extent
with respect to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, (i) solely as
reasonably necessary in connection with any Action related to either the
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, (i) reasonably necessary or desirable
in order to determine any matter relating to Seller's rights and obligations
hereunder and (i) solely as reasonably necessary in connection with its
legitimate tax or regulatory matters to the extent they relate to any pre-
Closing period.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law and entry
into customary confidentiality and use undertakings, upon reasonable advance
written request, Seller will afford promptly to Buyer and its authorized
Representatives during normal business hours, reasonable access to its
properties, books, records, employees and auditors, (i) solely to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates to
comply with their financial reporting, accounting or auditing obligations with
respect to any period ending before the Closing Date, (i) solely to the extent with respect to Purchased Assets,

connection with any Action related to either the Purchased Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or the Business, (i) reasonably necessary or desirable in order to
determine any matter relating to Buyer's rights and obligations hereunder and
(i) solely as reasonably necessary in connection with its legitimate tax or
regulatory matters to the extent they relate to any pre-Closing for the
Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Business.

(d) Any access granted to either party or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 7.08 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party granting such
access. The party to whom such access or other cooperation is granted pursuant
to this Section 7.08 shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred by the other party or its
Representatives in connection therewith.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 7.08 shall require (A) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to provide the
other party or its Representatives with access to (i) personnel records of
employees relating to medical histories or other information, the disclosure
of which, in the disclosing party's reasonable good faith opinion after
consultation with counsel, would violate Applicable Law or (ii) information
the disclosure of which, in the disclosing party's reasonable good faith
opinion after consultation with counsel (x) would conflict with
confidentiality obligations to which such party or any of its Affiliates is
bound or (y) would reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture or
waiver of any attorney-client or similar privilege; provided, that, in the
case of clauses (x) and (y), the disclosing party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other party, to the extent possible, with
access to the relevant information in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to result in the violation of such confidentiality or forfeiture or
waiver of any such attorney-client or similar privilege, or (B) either party's
independent accountants or auditors to make available to the other party or
its Representatives any work papers unless and until such Person has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants.

(f) For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
respective Affiliates shall retain the books and records Seller has in its
possession relating to the Business relating to periods prior to the Closing
which shall not otherwise have been delivered to Buyer.

grants to Buyer and the Purchased Subsidiaries a limited, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license for a term of eighteen

Section 8.03 Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes.

(a) Seller shall (i) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account
any extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns with respect to the
Purchased Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date and timely pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns and (i)
file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any extension of a
required filing date), all Tax Returns that (x) relate to Combined Taxes or

on such Tax Returns. All other Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased
Subsidiaries shall be filed or caused to be filed by Buyer.

(b) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, any Tax Return required to
be filed by or with respect to a Purchased Subsidiary after the Closing Date
that relates to Income Taxes for a Straddle Tax Period (each a "Buyer-Filed

(unless otherwise required by a change in Applicable Law) and without a change
of any election or any accounting method and shall submit any such Tax Return
to Seller (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably
requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least 30 Business Days prior
to the due date (including any applicable extension) of such return. Seller
shall have the right to review and comment on such Buyer-Filed Straddle Period
Income Tax Return. If Seller, within 10 Business Days after review of any such

it objects to any items in such return, the disputed item shall be resolved in
a manner mutually agreeable to both parties within 10 Business Days, and if
not so resolved, then by a jointly retained Accounting Referee (which may be
the same as or different from the Accounting Referee retained pursuant to
Section 2.10(c), if any) within a reasonable time, taking into account the
deadline for filing such return. Upon resolution of all such items, the
relevant Buyer-Filed Straddle Period Income Tax Return shall be adjusted to
reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further
adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such Accounting Referee shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a Final Determination, no Purchased Subsidiary shall amend any Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-closing portion of a Straddle
Tax Period without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer shall timely
file (taking into account any extensions of a required filing date), and shall
pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to, any Buyer-Filed Straddle Period Income Tax Return filed under this Section 8.03(b) in
accordance with Applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
any Pre-Closing Income Taxes shown as due and payable on any Buyer-Filed
Straddle Period Income Tax Return prepared in compliance with this Section
8.03(b), to the extent not paid at or before Closing, by five days prior to
the latest date on which such Taxes are due and payable by Buyer without
interest or penalties.

(c) Except for refunds arising from the carry back of a net operating loss
from a taxable period commencing after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay or

by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Purchased Subsidiaries attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period paid by Seller, the Purchased Subsidiaries or any
predecessor or Affiliate of Seller no later than ten days following receipt of
such refund, net of any Taxes imposed thereon.

(d) Seller shall include the Purchased Subsidiaries in any Tax Return for
Combined Taxes, as applicable, through the close of business on the Closing
Date.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) any
applicable Non-Recoverable Transfer Taxes payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%)
by Seller when due and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer when due and (ii) any
applicable Recoverable Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the party entitled to
the recovery of such Recoverable Transfer Taxes, provided, if applicable, the
supplier furnished the prescribed information to entitle the recipient to
claim an input tax credit or refund. Seller shall file (or cause to be filed)
all necessary Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes that are required by
Applicable Law to be filed by Seller. Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed)
all other Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable
Law, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate in preparing and filing and join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) for any Transfer Taxes in respect
of which it is required to file Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.03(e),
pay to the relevant Taxing Authority any Transfer Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Returns and (ii) for any Transfer Taxes in respect of which the other
party is required to file Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 8.03(e), pay to
the other party, within two Business Days prior to the due date for such
Transfer Taxes, any portion of such Transfer Taxes that it is required to bear
under this Section 8.03(e). Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) avail itself of any available exemptions from, or any refunds,
credits or other recovery of, any such Transfer Taxes or fees (including, if
applicable, by making any Canadian Tax Elections) and shall cooperate with the
other party in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions, refunds, credits or other recovery and
(ii) minimize the amount of any such Transfer Taxes. (f) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Tax that is payable for
a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Tax incurred in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period in the case of income, sales, employment or other Taxes readily
apportionable between periods shall equal the portion of such Tax that would
have been payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date based on a deemed closing of the books and, in the case of all other
Taxes, shall equal the portion of such Tax that would have been payable based
on the proportion of the number of days in the Tax period that arose on and
before the Closing Date. Any credits with respect to a Straddle Tax Period
shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation
set forth in the foregoing sentence shall be made in a manner consistent with
prior practice of Seller, its Subsidiaries or the Purchased Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

Section 8.04 Cooperation on Tax Matters. (a) Subject to Section 8.04(b), Buyer
and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Purchased Subsidiaries (including access to books and records) as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including any report
required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), the making of any election relating to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyer and Seller
shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased
Subsidiaries until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations and
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing

commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other party with at least 30
days' prior written notice before destroying any such books and records,
during which period the party receiving the notice can elect to take
possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding
relating to Taxes involving the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Purchased Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except to the
extent solely relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries, the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required at
any time to provide to Buyer any right to access or to review any Tax Return
or Tax work papers of Seller, any Seller Group, or any Affiliate of Seller
(such Tax Returns or Tax work papers, the "Seller Tax Records"). Section 8.05 Buyer Covenants.

(a) Buyer covenants that it shall not cause or permit any Purchased Subsidiary
or any Affiliate of Buyer to (i) take any action on the Closing Date other
than in the ordinary course of business, including the distribution of any
dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, that could give rise to any
Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset of Seller or a Seller Group or give rise
to any loss of Seller or a Seller Group under this Agreement or (ii) (A) amend
any Tax Return of any of the Purchased Foreign Subsidiaries with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) except as expressly required or permitted by
this Agreement, make or change any Tax election that would apply to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any Purchased Foreign Subsidiary or (C) change the Tax
period of any Purchased Foreign Subsidiary for any Tax year for U.S. or
foreign tax reporting purposes that includes the Closing Date, in each case
without the prior written consent of Seller.

(b) Buyer shall take (or shall cause to be taken) all steps necessary in order
to effectuate an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state or local) with respect to the purchase and
sale of the shares of the Purchased Mexican Subsidiaries. Buyer represents,
warrants, covenants and agrees that (i) the purchaser (or regarded parent of
the purchaser, if such purchaser is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) of each Purchased Mexican Subsidiary is, and that Buyer
will take all actions necessary to ensure that on the Closing Date such
purchaser (or regarded parent of the purchaser, if such purchaser is a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be, eligible to
make a Section 338(g) election with respect to the shares of the Purchased
Mexican Subsidiaries and (ii) neither Buyer nor such purchaser (or regarded
parent of the purchaser, if such purchaser is a disregarded entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) has any plan or intention to take, and Buyer
will, and will cause such purchaser (or regarded parent of the purchaser, if
such purchaser is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
to, refrain from taking, any actions that would reasonably be expected to
cause such purchaser (or regarded parent of the purchaser, if such purchaser
is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to fail to
qualify as a purchasing corporation within the meaning of Section 338 of the
Code.

Section 8.06 Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller shall cause any and all existing
Tax Sharing Agreements, except for this Agreement, between any Purchased
Subsidiary and any Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to be terminated as of
the Closing Date. After such date none of the Purchased Subsidiaries, Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller shall have any further rights or obligations
thereunder. From and after the Closing Date, this Agreement shall be the sole
Tax Sharing Agreement between Seller or any Affiliate of Seller and the
Purchased Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

Section 8.07 Tax Indemnification. (a) Seller hereby indemnifies the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any
(i) Pre-Closing Income Tax of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries, (ii)
liability for the payment of any amount of the type described in clause (i) as a result of any
Purchased Subsidiary being or having been before the Closing a member of a
Seller Group, (iii) any Taxes arising from or related to any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, the Specified Tax Representations, (iv) Pre-Closing Non-Income
Tax of any of the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Business to the extent, and to

Canadian Seller's failure to provide a certificate under Section 6 of the
Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario), and (vi) liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and
expenses), arising out of, relating to or incident to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any Tax described in clauses (i) - (v) above,
including those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate
proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such
Tax (any amount described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) above,
a "Seller Indemnified Tax Loss"); provided, however, that Seller shall have no
liability for the payment of any Seller Indemnified Tax Loss attributable to
or resulting from a breach of Section 8.05.

(b) Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller Indemnified Parties against and agrees
to hold each of them harmless from (i) any Taxes that the Seller Indemnified
Parties may be liable for or incur, or become subject to, as a result of any
Taxes imposed on a Purchased Subsidiary with respect to a Post-Closing Tax
Period, other than Taxes with respect to which Seller is obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.07(a); (i) any
breach of covenant or agreement in this Article 8 made or to be performed by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) any goods and services tax/harmonized
sales tax, Quebec sales tax, penalties, interest and other amounts which may
be assessed against the Canadian Seller as a result of the transfer of the
Canadian Assets not being eligible for any Canadian Tax Election jointly
executed by the Canadian Seller and the Canadian Buyer under Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act (Canada) or an Act respecting the Quebec sales tax or as a
result of the Canadian Buyer's failure to file such elections within the
prescribed time; and (iv) liabilities, costs and expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses) arising
out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax
described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii), including those incurred in the
contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each case incurred or suffered by
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(c) The provisions of Section 11.07 (other than Section 11.07(c)), shall
apply, mutatis mutandis in respect of any indemnification payment under this
Section 8.07. Any breach or inaccuracy, and the calculation of Damages related
thereto, of any item subject to indemnification under this Article 8 should be
determined without regard to any qualification contained therein relating to
"Material Adverse Effect" or "materiality." (d) If any claim, demand, audit, investigation or proceeding with respect to
Taxes in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either (i) this
Section 8.07 or (i) Section 11.02 as an Excluded Liability, or for breach or
inaccuracy of a representation, warranty (including the Tax Representations)
or covenant contained in this Article 8 (any such claim or demand, a "Tax
Claim") is asserted or commenced against the party which would be entitled to
seek such indemnification (the "Potential Indemnified Party") or any of its
Affiliates, the Potential Indemnified Party shall notify the party from which
such indemnification would be sought (the "Potential Indemnifying Party") of
such Tax Claim in writing within ten days of receipt of such claim, demand,
audit, investigation or proceeding and shall give the Potential Indemnifying
Party such information with respect thereto as the Potential Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request; provided, that the failure of the Potential
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this Section 8.07(d) shall not
relieve any Potential Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section
8.07, except to the extent that such failure adversely prejudices the rights
of any such Potential Indemnifying Party. The Potential Indemnifying Party may
discharge, at any time, its indemnification obligation with respect to any Tax
Claim by paying to the Potential Indemnified Party the amount payable pursuant
to this Section 8.07 or Section 11.02, as the case may be, calculated on the
date of such payment. The Potential Indemnifying Party shall have the right,
at its own expense, to participate in and, upon notice to the Potential
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action,
litigation or proceeding (including any Tax audit) relating to a Tax Claim (a
"Tax Controversy"), and the Potential Indemnifying Party shall not have any
indemnification obligations with respect to any payment in respect of any
Taxes arising out of a Tax Controversy with a Taxing Authority as to which it
was not afforded such right. If the Potential Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Potential Indemnifying Party shall have the sole discretion as to
the conduct of such defense and the Potential Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Potential Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Potential Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate and shall cause their Affiliates to cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof.

(e) The Potential Indemnifying Party shall not be liable in respect of any Tax
Claim under this Section 8.07 or Section 11.02, as the case may be, for any
Tax (i) the payment of which was made without the Potential Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent, unless the Potential Indemnified Party has
complied with the provisions set forth in Section 8.07(d) and a Final
Determination of the amount of Tax has been made, (i) resulting from a
settlement effected without the consent of the Potential Indemnifying Party,
or (i) resulting from any Tax Controversy with respect to which the Potential
Indemnified Party has not complied with the provisions set forth in Section
8.07(d). Section 8.08 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) the Specified Tax Representations and the covenants and
agreements contained in this Article 8 shall survive until sixty (60) days
after the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof) and (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 (other than the Specified Tax
Representations) shall not survive the Closing.

Section 8.09 Canadian Tax Elections. The parties shall make and file, if
relevant and applicable, any Canadian Tax Elections that may be requested by
Seller and, in the case of the Canadian Tax Elections set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) of the definition of Canadian Tax Elections, which the Buyer
determines, acting reasonably, are not expected to adversely affect Buyer (or
any Affiliate thereof), in each case in the manner and within the time
prescribed by Applicable Law. If Canadian Buyer and Canadian Seller file the
Canadian Tax Election under subsection 20(24) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
and under the corresponding provincial provisions regarding the amount paid by
Canadian Seller to Canadian Buyer for assuming future obligations relating to
the Business of Canadian Seller (as required if such election is relevant),
Canadian Buyer and Canadian Seller acknowledge that a portion of the Canadian
Assets transferred by Canadian Seller pursuant to this Agreement and having a
value equal to the amount elected under subsection 20(24) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada) and the equivalent provincial provisions is being transferred by
Canadian Seller as a payment for the assumption of such future obligations by
Canadian Buyer.

Section 8.10 Tax Elections. Seller shall join Buyer in making an election
under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding elections under state,
local or non-US tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Domestic
Subsidiary Shares and deemed sale of all of the outstanding equity of
Clairson, Inc. Seller will pay any Tax attributable to the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) election. Buyer represents, warrants, covenants and agrees
that (i) the purchaser of the Domestic Subsidiary Shares is, and that Buyer
will take all actions necessary to ensure that on the Closing Date such
purchaser will be, eligible to make a Section 338(h)(10) election with respect
to the Domestic Subsidiary Shares and the deemed sale of all of the
outstanding equity of Clarison, Inc. and (ii) neither Buyer nor such purchaser
has any plan or intention to take, and Buyer will, and will cause such
purchaser to, refrain from taking, any actions that would reasonably be
expected to cause such purchaser to fail to qualify as a purchasing
corporation within the meaning of Section 338 of the Code.



 ARTICLE 9 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 9.01 Purchased Subsidiary Business Employees and Non-TSA Business
Employees. Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable
Third-Party Employer to) (i) continue the employment at and after the
Applicable Transfer Time of each Purchased Subsidiary Business Employee and
(i) within a reasonable period of time (but not fewer than fifteen (15)
Business Days) prior to the Closing Date, make a Qualifying Offer to each Non-
TSA Business Employee commencing as of the Applicable Transfer Time. In
addition, with respect to any Non-TSA Business Employee who is based in China,
at the request of Seller, Buyer shall (or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a Tri-Partite Agreement with Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate), Buyer (or its applicable Subsidiary or the applicable
Third-Party Employer), and such Business Employee effective as of the
Applicable Transfer Time. Unless a written acceptance of an offer of
employment is required by Applicable Law, a Business Employee who continues
employment or who has received and accepts an offer of employment pursuant to
this Section 9.01 or Section 9.02 shall be deemed to have accepted such
continuance or offer, unless such Business Employee specifically declines such
continuance or offer. Each Business Employee who accepts, or is deemed to
accept, such continuance or offer pursuant to this Section 9.01 or Section
9.02 is referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee".

Section 9.02 TSA Employees. Buyer shall (or shall cause its relevant
Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer) to make a Qualifying Offer
to each TSA Employee and Philippines Employee, such offer to be made not later
than 30 days prior to the relevant TSA Termination Date and offering that such
employment will commence as of the Applicable Transfer Time. In addition, with
respect to any TSA Employee who is based in China, or such other country as
Seller may specify, at the request of Seller, Buyer shall (or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to enter into a Tri-Partite
Agreement with Seller (or its applicable Affiliate), Buyer (or its applicable
Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer), and such TSA Employee
effective as of the Applicable Transfer Time. In addition, with respect to any
Philippines Employee, at the request of Seller, Buyer shall (or shall cause
its applicable Subsidiary to or the applicable Third-Party Employer) use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each such employee executes
appropriate documents in respect of the transfer of his or her employment from
Seller to Buyer (or its applicable Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party
Employer), including documentation that may be required by the relevant local
authorities and documentation in favor of Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate), in a format approved by Seller (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned by Seller), releasing Seller (or
its applicable Affiliate) from, and confirming that such employee does not
have, any claims in relation to his or her employment with Seller (or its
applicable Affiliate) or the transfer and/or cessation of such employment or
otherwise.

Section 9.03 Maintenance of Terms and Conditions. Subject to the other
provisions of this Article 9, as applicable, Buyer agrees that it shall
provide (or cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable Third-Party Employer to
provide) each Transferred Employee with, for the Relevant Period, terms and conditions that are not less
favorable than the terms and conditions provided to such Transferred Employee:
(a)(i) an annual base salary and (ii) annual cash bonus opportunity, in each
case, as in effect immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time; (a)
benefits that are not less favorable in the aggregate (for clarity, on an
after-tax basis) than the benefits provided to such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time excluding any benefits
pursuant to the Seller DB Plan and (c) in respect of working location as in
effect immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer agrees that, during the Relevant Period, each Transferred
Employee resident in the United States shall be eligible to participate in
Buyer's Employee Stock Ownership Plan on the same basis as similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer also agrees that, during the
Relevant Period, Buyer shall provide equity and/or long-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities to the Management Leadership Team (as defined
below) with an aggregate annual value of approximately the amount set forth on
Section 9.03 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Compensation Pool"); provided,
however, that Buyer shall not be required to provide an award to a Transferred
Employee who is determined by Buyer to not be in good standing; and provided
further that grants of equity and/or long-term cash incentive compensation
opportunities pursuant to such Compensation Pool shall be subject to the
approval of Buyer's compensation committee (and on the same basis as such
grants to employees in Buyer's other businesses are subject to such approval).
"Management Leadership Team" shall mean (i) the president of the Business and
each of his direct reports, and (ii) an additional group of approximately
twenty management and senior level Transferred Employees. Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 9 to the contrary, the terms and conditions provided
to Transferred Employees following the Applicable Transfer Time shall be
subject to the requirements of Applicable Law and all applicable collective
bargaining and works council agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, in
respect of any International Plan that provides retirement benefits and that
is a Purchased Subsidiary Benefit Plan, Buyer shall ensure that such Purchased
Subsidiary Benefit Plan shall, for the Relevant Period, continue to provide
benefits in respect of participating Transferred Employees that are not less
favorable than the benefits provided under such plan as in effect immediately
prior to the Applicable Transfer Time. Section 9.04 US Defined Contribution Plans.

(a) As of the Applicable Transfer Time, each Transferred Employee who is based
primarily in the United States shall be fully vested in his or her account
balances under any defined contribution plan and trust intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code that is sponsored by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller DC Plan"). Effective as of the
Applicable Transfer Time or any subsequent date reasonably requested by Buyer
(but not later than the 90th day following the Applicable Transfer Time), each
such Transferred Employee shall be eligible to elect a "direct rollover" (as
described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances
(other than participant loans, which are addressed in the next sentence) under
the Seller DC Plan to a defined contribution plan and trust intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that is sponsored by Buyer or one of
its Affiliates, in the form of cash (the "Buyer DC Plan"). Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
enable each such Transferred Employee to be eligible to elect a direct
rollover of any participant loans under the Seller DC Plan, in the form of
participant loan notes, to the Buyer DC Plan (provided such loan is current on
payments) or to replace such loan under the Buyer DC Plan.

(b) During the Relevant Period, the Buyer DC Plan shall provide benefits to
each such Transferred Employee that are not less favorable than the benefits
provided under the Seller DC Plan as in effect immediately prior to the
Applicable Transfer Time with respect to the availability and amounts of
loans, the employer matching contribution and the vesting schedule (except
that Buyer need not utilize the same method of calculating service going
forward) for such contribution as reflected in the summary plan descriptions
(including the appendices thereto) of the Seller DC Plan that have been
provided to Buyer, but not with respect to form of benefits; provided,
however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to make any employer matching
contribution to the Buyer DC Plan on behalf of any Transferred Employee to the
extent that such employer matching contribution would, in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer, cause the Buyer DC Plan or Buyer to fail to comply with
applicable nondiscrimination requirements under the Code or other Applicable
Law.

Section 9.05 US Defined Benefit Plans. With respect to the Emerson Retirement
Plan, a defined benefit plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the "Seller DB Plan"), each Transferred Employee who is a participant in
the Seller DB Plan shall be 100% vested in his or her accrued benefit and
shall cease to participate in the Seller DB Plan as of the Applicable Transfer
Time. Seller shall retain all assets and liabilities thereunder, including
responsibility for all benefits accrued to each such Transferred Employee
under the terms of the Seller DB Plan.

Section 9.06 International Retirement Plans. With respect to each
International Plan (other than any Purchased Subsidiary Benefit Plan) which
provides retirement benefits in Canada, China, Mexico and the Philippines
(each, a "Seller International Retirement Plan"):

(a) effective as of the Applicable Transfer Time, each Transferred Employee
who is an active participant in a Seller International Retirement Plan
immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time shall cease to be an active
participant under such plan, shall be vested in his or her accrued benefits
earned under such plan through the Applicable Transfer Time to the extent
required by the relevant plan terms or Applicable Law, and shall become a participant in one
or more retirement plans established or designated by Buyer (collectively, the
"Buyer International Retirement Plan"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, given
the small size and nature of the workforce in Canada, Buyer may elect not to
establish a Buyer International Retirement Plan in Canada and instead to
provide alternative compensation on terms that comply with Section 9.03(b) to
the Transferred Employees in Canada. Seller shall have no obligation or
Liability for benefits under the Buyer International Retirement Plan, and
Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
against any and all claims or Damages arising out of any Transferred
Employee's participation in the Buyer International Retirement Plan, including
claims for benefits under such plan;

(b) In the event that Buyer elects to establish a Buyer International
Retirement Plan in Canada: (i) Buyer agrees to enroll the Transferred
Employees who are participants as of immediately prior to the Applicable
Transfer Time in the applicable retirement plan for employees of Emerson
Electric Canada Limited (the "Canada DC Plan") in the applicable Buyer
International Retirement Plan as of the Applicable Transfer Time (the "Buyer
Canada DC Plan") and (ii) the Buyer Canada DC Plan shall provide that the
service credit of each Transferred Employee under the Canada DC Plan as of the
Applicable Transfer Time will be considered service credit under such Buyer
Canada DC Plan and will be taken into account under such Buyer Canada DC Plan
for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting and otherwise on terms
that reflect the service credit provisions of Section 9.07. Buyer shall ensure
that the Buyer Canada DC Plan shall, for the Relevant Period, provide benefits
that are not less favorable than the benefits provided under the Canada DC

International Retirement Plan as of the Applicable Transfer Time (the "Buyer
Deferred Savings Plan"). The Buyer Deferred Savings Plan shall provide that
the service credit of each Transferred Employee under the China Deferred
Savings Plan as of the Applicable Transfer Time will be considered service
credit under such Buyer Deferred Savings Plan and will be taken into account
under such Buyer Deferred Savings Plan for purposes of determining eligibility
and vesting and otherwise on terms that reflect the service credit provisions
of Section 9.07. Buyer shall ensure that the Buyer Deferred Savings Plan
shall, for the Relevant Period, provide benefits that are not less favorable
than the benefits provided under the China Deferred Savings Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time; and

(d) Buyer agrees to enroll the Transferred Employees who are participants as
of immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time in the applicable
retirement plan for employees of Emerson Electric de Mexico S.A. de C.V. (the
"Mexico DC Plan") in the applicable Buyer International Retirement Plan as of the
Applicable Transfer Time (the "Buyer Mexico DC Plan"). The Buyer Mexico DC
Plan shall provide that the service credit of each Transferred Employee under
the Mexico DC Plan as of the Applicable Transfer Time will be considered
service credit under such Buyer Mexico DC Plan and will be taken into account
under such Buyer Mexico DC Plan for purposes of determining eligibility and
vesting and otherwise on terms that reflect the service credit provisions of

Relevant Period, provide benefits that are not less favorable than the

Plan") in the applicable Buyer International Retirement Plan (the "Buyer
Philippines DB Plan") as of the Applicable Transfer Time, and such Buyer
Philippines DB Plan shall be liable for purposes of determining eligibility,
vesting and benefits to the same extent as such service was recognized with
respect to such Transferred Employees accrued under the Philippines DB Plan
prior to the Applicable Transfer Time. Buyer shall ensure that the Buyer
Philippines DB Plan shall, for the Relevant Period, provide benefits that are
not less favorable than the benefits provided under the Philippines DB Plan as
in effect immediately prior to the Applicable Transfer Time.

Section 9.07 Service Credit.



(a) Buyer shall grant (or cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable Third-Party
Employer to grant) each Transferred Employee credit for years of prior
service, and recognize such employee's continuity of service, with Seller or
any of its Affiliates or their respective predecessors for all purposes under
each employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or the applicable Third-Party Employer) in which such Transferred
Employee is eligible to participate, including for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and benefit accruals (but not
for purposes of any equity compensation or for benefit accruals under defined
benefit or other pension plans (other than benefit accruals under the
Philippines DB Plan, the Emerson Electric de Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V.
Termination Indemnity and Seniority Premium Plan, the ClosetMaid Reynosa, S.
de R.L. de C.V. Termination Indemnity and Seniority Premium Plan and any
401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates)); provided, however, that
such credit shall not result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer and Seller
agree to cooperate and exchange such information as is necessary to determine
prior service and avoid any such duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable Third-
Party Employer to) credit each Transferred Employee with all paid time off
accrued and unused by such Transferred Employee through the Applicable
Transfer Time; provided that, to the extent required by Applicable Law, all paid time off accrued and unused by such Transferred
Employee through the Applicable Transfer Time, solely to the extent included
in Closing Working Capital, shall be paid by Buyer (or its Subsidiaries or the
applicable Third-Party Employer) to the Transferred Employee (or reimbursed by
Buyer to Seller (or its relevant Affiliate) if Applicable Law requires Seller
(or its relevant Affiliate) to pay such paid time off accrued and unused by
such Transferred Employee through the Applicable Transfer Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.07 to the contrary, no service
credit shall be provided under the ClosetMaid Reynosa, S. de R.L. de C.V.
Termination Indemnity and Seniority Premium Plan and/or any other benefit of
ClosetMaid Reynosa, S. de R.L. de C.V. whatsoever (i) to any Transferred
Employee who, as of the date hereof, is directly employed by or primarily
provides services to Emerson Electric de Mexico S.A. de C.V. or (ii) to the
extent that the provision of such service credit would bind or create a labor
relationship of such Transferred Employee with ClosetMaid Reynosa, S. de R.L.
de C.V. and/or by any means would reasonably be expected to cause ClosetMaid
Reynosa to fail to qualify as a maquiladora under Applicable Law.

(b) Seller agrees to provide Buyer, as promptly as practicable following
Buyer's request, (i) compensation information for each Transferred Employee
for calendar year 2016 and for calendar year 2017 through September 30, 2017
to assist Buyer in its qualified plan discrimination testing under the Buyer

Transferred Employee shall cease participation in the health and welfare

plans maintained, administered or contributed to by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing
benefits in respect of claims incurred under a Seller Welfare Plan for
Transferred Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents prior to
the Applicable Transfer Time. Benefits in respect of all welfare plan claims
incurred by Transferred Employees at or after the Applicable Transfer Time
shall be provided by Buyer and its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section

life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident
insurance benefits, upon the death or accident giving rise to such benefits,
(i) health or medical, dental, vision care and/or prescription drug benefits,
upon provision of the applicable services, materials or supplies and (i) with
respect to short- and long-term disability benefits, upon the date of an
individual's disability, as determined by the disability benefit insurance
carrier or claim administrator, giving rise to such claim or expense. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller's and Buyer's respective obligations under this Section 9.08
shall be subject to the Transition Services Agreement, where applicable.

Section 9.09 Pre-Existing Conditions and Co-Payments. Buyer shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable Third-Party Employer to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under
any health and welfare plans in which such Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents are eligible to participate after the Applicable Transfer
Time to the extent that such limitations were waived or satisfied under the
applicable health and welfare plan sponsored by Seller or one of its
Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees and/or eligible dependents
participated immediately before the Applicable Transfer Time; and

Applicable Transfer Time.

Section 9.10 Flexible Spending Accounts. As of the Applicable Transfer Time
and subject to Applicable Law, Seller shall transfer from medical and
dependent care account plans of Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Seller FSA
Plan") to one or more medical and dependent care account plans established or
designated by Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer FSA Plan") the account balances
of Transferred Employees, and Buyer shall be responsible for the obligations
of the Seller FSA Plans to provide benefits to Transferred Employees with
respect to such transferred account balances at or after the Applicable
Transfer Time. Each Transferred Employee shall be permitted to continue to
have payroll deductions made as most recently elected by him or her under the
applicable Seller FSA Plan. Promptly following the Applicable Transfer Time,
(a) if the aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to Transferred Employees
under the Seller FSA Plan for the plan year in which the Applicable Transfer
Time occurs exceeds the aggregate amount withheld from Transferred Employees'
compensation under the Seller FSA Plan for such plan year, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to such excess, or (b) if such aggregate amount
withheld exceeds such aggregate amount of reimbursements, Seller shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to such excess.

Section 9.11 Severance. (a) Buyer shall reimburse Seller or its relevant
Affiliate in respect of any severance or other termination-related payments or
benefits paid or provided by Seller or its Affiliates to any Business Employee
who does not receive, or who rejects, an offer of employment from Buyer or one
of its Subsidiaries (or a Third-Party Employer) that is not a Qualifying Offer
or, solely with respect to Business Employees who are not Philippines Employees, to the extent that an
offer from a Third-Party Employer would give such Business Employee an
entitlement to any severance or other termination-related payments or
benefits, because such offer is from a Third-Party Employer.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall each be responsible for 50% of any severance or
other termination-related payments or benefits required to be paid or provided
to (i) any Business Employee who rejects an offer of employment from Buyer or
one of its Subsidiaries that is a Qualifying Offer or (ii) any Transferred
Employee that are triggered by the transfer of such Transferred Employee from
Seller or its relevant Affiliate to Buyer or its relevant Affiliate (or the
applicable Third-Party Employer) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents; provided that with respect to any
such payment to the Philippines Employees, the allocation of liabilities with
respect to severance or other termination-related payments or benefits shall
be as follows: (i) for such liability that is accrued through the Effective
Time, Buyer's responsibility for such 50%, in the aggregate, shall be capped
at $125,000 and (ii) for such liability that accrues thereafter through the
Applicable Transfer Time, Buyer's responsibility for such 50%, in the
aggregate, shall not be capped.

(c) Any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated other than for
cause during the Relevant Period shall be entitled to severance or other
termination-related payments or benefits from Buyer in an amount substantially
equal in the aggregate to the aggregate amount of the severance or other
termination-related payments or benefits that he or she would have received
under (i) the severance plan or other similar contractual or discretionary
practice or policy of Seller or its Affiliates (as in effect immediately prior
to the date hereof), as set forth on Section 9.11 of the Disclosure Schedule,
and/or (ii) statutory or regulatory scheme, in either case applicable to such
Transferred Employee (taking into account any post-Applicable Transfer Time
service with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries), assuming for purposes of this
Section 9.11(c) that such Transferred Employee had satisfied any requirements
for the receipt of severance under such plan, practice or policy or statutory
or regulatory scheme, as applicable; provided that, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Buyer's obligation to provide such Transferred Employee with
such severance or other termination-related payments or benefits shall be
subject to such Transferred Employee's execution, delivery and non-revocation
of a general release in customary form in favor of Seller, Buyer and their
respective Affiliates.

Section 9.12 Workers Compensation. Buyer shall be responsible for providing
benefits in respect of all claims for benefits in respect of workers
compensation and any comparable liabilities that are based upon Transferred
Employees' injuries or illnesses that arise at or after the Applicable
Transfer Time. Seller shall be responsible for providing benefits in respect
of all claims for benefits (other than claims under Purchased Subsidiary
Benefit Plans) in respect of workers compensation and any comparable liabilities that are based upon Transferred
Employees' injuries or illnesses that arise prior to the Applicable Transfer
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller's and Buyer's respective obligations
under this Section 9.12 shall be subject to the Transition Services Agreement,
where applicable.

Section 9.13 Labor Agreements. (a) With respect to each collective bargaining
or other similar labor agreement to which a Purchased Subsidiary is a party as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall, and shall cause such
Purchased Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer to, comply with
the terms of such agreement at all times following the Effective Time, subject
to any changes to such agreement as may be agreed upon between Buyer or such
Purchased Subsidiary or the applicable Third-Party Employer and the union or
other labor organization that is party thereto, to the extent required by
Applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, satisfy any notice, consent, bargaining, or similar obligations that may
be required, with respect to or relating to the Business Employees, by
Contract (including any collective bargaining agreement) or Applicable Law;
provided that Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries or the applicable
Third-Party Employer to, reasonably cooperate with Seller and its Subsidiaries
where necessary to enable Seller and its Subsidiaries to satisfy such
obligations.

Section 9.14 Employee Communications. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in
communications with Business Employees with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained by Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates and with respect
to other matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents (including the termination of the Transition
Services Agreement).

Section 9.15 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the generality of
the last sentence of Section 13.07, nothing in this Article 9, express or
implied, (a) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto, including any Business Employee, any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (a) shall
establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an
undertaking to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (b) shall create any obligation on the
part of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to employ any
Business Employee for any period following the Effective Time.

Section 9.16 Cooperation. Each of Buyer and Seller recognize it to be in the
best interests of the parties hereto and their respective employees that the
transactions in this Article 9 be effected in an orderly manner and agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate fully in complying with
the provisions of this Article 9. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
execute, deliver and file all documents and to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such actions
as are deemed by Buyer and Seller as being necessary or desirable in order to
carry out and perform the purpose of this Article 9 and to facilitate the
transactions referred to in this Article 9.

ARTICLE 11

to such right of indemnity shall have been given pursuant to Section 11.03 or
11.04, as applicable, to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought

Section 11.02 Indemnification. (a) Effective at and after the Closing, Seller
indemnifies Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Purchased Subsidiaries) and

or indirectly arising out of or relating to, without duplication:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement or any Foreign Transfer Agreement (each such breach, a "Warranty
Breach") by Seller or the Retained Subsidiaries (except any Warranty Breach
relating to Tax Representations which shall be governed solely by Article 8);
provided that any such breach or inaccuracy, and the calculation of Damages
related thereto, shall be determined (except with respect to the determination
of any such breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.07 and Section 3.09(a) and the use of the term "Material
Contract" or "Material Contracts") without regard to any qualification
contained therein relating to "Material Adverse Effect" or materiality;

pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i) (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations, the Special Representations, the other representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.04 and the representations set forth in
Section 3.22) or in the case of Fraud, (A) Seller shall not be liable in
respect of any individual Warranty Breach unless the Damages with respect
thereto exceed $100,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"), at which point the full
amount of the Damage shall be taken into account, (B) Seller shall not be
liable in respect of any such Warranty Breach until the aggregate amount of
all Damages (taking into account only those claims that exceed the De Minimis
Amount, and, in such case, the full amount of the claim shall be taken into
account) exceed $1,950,000 (the "Deductible"), and then all Damages from a dollar-one basis shall be taken into account and (C) Seller's
maximum Liability for all such Warranty Breaches shall not exceed $26,000,000;
provided, further, Seller's maximum aggregate Liability pursuant to Section
11.02(a)(i), including with respect to the Fundamental Representations, the
Special Representations, the other representations and warranties contained in

provided that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches
pursuant to Section 11.02(b) (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) or in the case of Fraud, (A) Buyer shall not be liable in
respect of any individual Warranty Breach unless the Damages with respect

Section 11.03 Procedures. (a) Each Person seeking indemnification under this
Article 11 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notice to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by any third party
("Third Party Claim"); provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give notice as provided in this Section 11.03(a) shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.02, except to the
extent that such failure actually and materially adversely prejudices the
rights of any such Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all written notices and documents (including any court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other
information with respect to any such Third Party Claim reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
sole option and expense, upon delivery of written notice to the Indemnified
Party within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice of such Third
Party Claim from the Indemnified Party, to be represented by counsel of its
choice and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.03 and
Section 11.06 with respect to Environmental Indemnity Matters, to assume
control of, and defend against, negotiate, settle (subject to clause (b)) or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party may
nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim or any Environmental Indemnity Matter pursuant to this Article 11,
then the Indemnified Party may assume, defend against, negotiate, settle
(subject to clause (b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim or
Environmental Indemnity Matter, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and
expense to the extent such costs and expenses constitute indemnifiable Damages
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim or the resolution of any Environmental Indemnity Matter pursuant
to this Article 11, then the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its
own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim or Environmental
Indemnity Matter, as applicable; provided, that such Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) requested by the Indemnifying Party
to participate, (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying
Party, a material conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation advisable;
provided, further, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense thereof; provided, further, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim or Environmental
Indemnity Matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim or any Environmental Indemnity Matter pursuant to this Article 11
unless (i) prior to doing so, the Indemnifying Party provides a written
undertaking to the Indemnified Party whereby the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges that, assuming as true the allegations of the Indemnified Party,
it is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim in a commercially reasonable and diligent manner and (iii) the
Third Party Claim does not relate to Taxes, is not brought by a Governmental
Body, does not relate to criminal charges, and the relief sought is not
primarily limited to monetary damages or if not so limited, the applicable
non-monetary remedy would reasonably be expected to be material to the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment (in each case, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be
required for any such settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Deductible to the extent applicable),
(ii) such settlement does not permit any Order or other equitable relief to be
entered, directly or indirectly, against the Indemnified Party or otherwise
impose any sanctions, restrictions or obligations on the Indemnified Party and
(iii) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all Liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third
Party Claim and does not include any statement as to or any admission of
fault, violation of Applicable Law culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment
on any Third Party Claim or in respect of any Environmental Indemnity Matter,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits (other than with respect to the PLL policy unless such subrogation is
expressly permitted) or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim or Environmental Indemnity Matter, as applicable.

(c) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated (in accordance with this Article 11), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party
shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to the
extent such costs and expenses are indemnifiable Damages hereunder, in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.03 or Section
11.04, neither this Section 11.03 nor Section 11.04 shall apply to
indemnification for a Tax Claim or otherwise with respect to the Tax
Representations. The procedures for such indemnification shall be governed
solely by Section 8.07(d) and (e).

Section 11.04 Direct Claim Procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party has a
claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give
prompt notice in writing, and as promptly as practicable, of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party, which notice shall in no event be delivered to the
Indemnifying Party later than 60 days after the Indemnified Party first learns
of the facts on which such claim is based (such 60-day period, the "Notice
Period"). Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the
basis for indemnification and the amount of such Damages incurred or that such
Indemnified Party reasonably estimates in good faith is likely to be incurred
in connection with such claim (taking into account the information then
available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party as promptly as practicable within the Notice Period shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
such failure shall have actually materially and adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party, and in any event, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
indemnification obligation in respect of any claim for which notice is
delivered following expiration of the applicable Notice Period for such claim.

Section 11.05 Environmental Insurance Matters. (a) The parties agree that
before Buyer is entitled to indemnity from Seller pursuant to Section 11.02(a)
for any Environmental Indemnity Matters that are within the scope and limits
of coverage under the PLL Policy (other than any applicable deductible or
self-insured retention which shall be Seller's obligation), Buyer will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain coverage under the PLL Policy (or any
renewal, replacement or extension thereof); provided, however, that (i) Buyer
shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain coverage if Buyer reasonably concludes that further efforts would be
futile and (ii) in no event shall Buyer be obligated to incur fifty thousand
($50,000) dollars or more in undertaking its reasonable best efforts to obtain
coverage for any single Environmental Indemnity Matter. Where after reasonable
best efforts by Buyer and its Affiliates the PLL Policy (or any renewal,
replacement or extension thereof) fails to provide coverage of any such
Environmental Liability that would have qualified as a Retained Environmental
Liability but for clause (b) of the definition of Assumed Environmental Liabilities or other Environmental Indemnity Matter for which
Seller would have liability under Section 11.02(a), such Environmental
Liability shall be deemed a Retained Environmental Liability and, subject to
the terms hereof, Seller's indemnity pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(iii) for
such Environmental Indemnity Matter shall then apply solely to the extent of
such failure of coverage and, at such time, the Seller or its designated
Affiliate, shall, to the extent expressly provided by the PLL Policy, be
subrogated to the rights of the first named insured under, or Buyer shall
cooperate in Seller's or its designated Affiliate's efforts to seek access to,
the PLL Policy (or any renewal, replacement or extension thereof) with respect
to such Environmental Indemnity Matter.

(b) Buyer's reasonable best efforts to obtain coverage available under the PLL
Policy as set forth in Section 11.05(a) shall include using such reasonable
best efforts to avoid invalidation of, maximize and collect any amounts
available under the PLL Policy (or any renewal, replacement or extension
thereof).

(c) For all claims submitted by Buyer or its Affiliates under the PLL Policy
(or any renewal, replacement or extension thereof) with respect to
Environmental Indemnity Matters that would qualify as a Retained Environmental
Liability but for clause (b) of the definition of Assumed Environmental
Liabilities or for which Seller would otherwise have liability under Section
11.02(a), (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with prior notice of the submittal;
(ii) Seller shall have the right to review and submit comments on the claim
submittal and all other correspondence and submittals to the insurer regarding
the claims, which reasonable comments Buyer shall review and use good faith
efforts to incorporate; (iii) unless the insurer objects, Buyer shall provide
Seller with the reasonable opportunity to be present during all meetings and
telephone calls with the insurer regarding the claim; (iv) Buyer shall not
settle or compromise a claim actually or potentially covered by the PLL Policy
without the written consent of Seller, which written consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The parties agree to reasonably
cooperate with each other with respect to any claim made under the PLL Policy
(or any renewal, replacement or extension thereof), including, in the event
such a claim relates to a divested or former location and the insurer of the
PLL Policy disputes whether the Environmental Liability giving rise to the
claim relates to a condition, matter, event or activity that occurred during
the period in which such location was owned, leased or operated by the
Business, the Seller or the Purchased Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
predecessors), at Seller's sole cost and expense, Seller shall control or,
Buyer, at Seller's option, shall control the response to and resolution of
such dispute with the PLL Policy insurer.

Section 11.06 Environmental Indemnity Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 11 and without limiting the proviso in Section
11.02(a), with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder for any
Retained Environmental Liability or Warranty Breach of Section 3.18
(collectively, "Environmental Indemnity Matters"), the parties agree on behalf
of themselves and their respective Affiliates that, in addition to the provisions set forth
in Article 11 (and in the case of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section 11.06 and any other provision in Article 11, the provisions of this
Section 11.06 shall prevail and apply):

(a) Seller shall have no Liability under this Agreement for any Damages (x) to
the extent arising out of or resulting from any testing, sampling, or other
invasive investigation of, or Remedial Action relating to, the air, soil, soil
gas, surface water, groundwater, sediment, building materials or other
environmental media or any disclosure, report or communication by or on behalf
of any Buyer Indemnified Party to, or the initiation or encouragement by or on
behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party of any action by, any Governmental
Authority or other third party relating to any Environmental Indemnity Matter
unless such action (i) is required by an Environmental Law, (ii) is required
by a Governmental Authority (or its designee) with jurisdiction over such
Environmental Indemnity Matter, (iii) is reasonably necessary pursuant to a
binding contractual obligation imposed by a lease or financing agreement in
effect as of the Closing or Deferred Closing Date, as applicable, (iv) is
reasonably necessary or reasonably prudent to respond to a Third Party Claim
received in writing by a Buyer Indemnified Party and for which written notice
is provided to Seller, (v) is commercially reasonably for any closure of the
facilities identified on items 5 and 6 of Section 3.12(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule that is conducted for a bona fide business purpose, or (vi) is
reasonably necessary in response to an imminent risk of material harm to human
health or safety or the environment, or (y) to the extent arising in
connection with any change in use from industrial to non-industrial use, or
commercial to non-commercial use, as the case may be, of any facility or real
property on or after the Closing.

(b) Any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party (including
as of the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) for Remedial Action of any
Environmental Indemnity Matter relating to Hazardous Substances releases or
contamination shall be limited to, and its obligations under this Agreement
shall be satisfied upon achievement of, the minimum Remedial Action standards
required to be met, based on the industrial or commercial use, as the case may
be, of the relevant property as of the Closing Date, by applicable
Environmental Laws as in effect at the time such Environmental Indemnity
Matter is addressed or by any Order or requirement of a Governmental
Authority. Both parties expressly agree that such minimum standards may
include risk-based clean-up remedies and standards and/or the imposition of
engineering or institutional controls such as deed or other use restrictions
permitted by Environmental Laws and, as applicable, a Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction, provided with respect to any property not owned by Buyer,
the Buyer Indemnified Party has legal capacity to agree to such standards or
consent is given by the party with legal capacity to agree to such standards,
and the use of such standards would not unreasonably interfere with or disrupt
the industrial or commercial use or operation, as the case may be, of the
affected Real Property. In the event of an Environmental Indemnity Matter
relating to non-compliance with, or violation of, Environmental Law, any obligation of Seller to indemnify a
Buyer Indemnified Party (including as of the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) for such Environmental Indemnity Matter shall be satisfied upon
achievement of the minimum actions necessary to be taken to resolve such
Environmental Indemnity Matter by the applicable Governmental Authorities or
Environmental Law.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the PLL Policy to the extent any
Environmental Indemnity Matter is within the scope and limits of coverage
under the PLL Policy, Seller has the right (but not the obligation) to retain
the defense and control of any Environmental Indemnity Matter, at its sole
cost and expense to the extent such costs and expenses constitute
indemnifiable Damages hereunder, including the disclosure, investigation,
negotiation, performance and settlement (subject to Section 11.03(b)) thereof
and Remedial Action relating thereto, subject to Buyer's participation in such
defense and control as provided below. In connection with such, Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate regarding the resolution of any such Environmental Indemnity Matter,
including providing Seller and its Representatives with all necessary
accommodations, including, upon reasonable prior notice (except in the case of
an emergency, in which such prior notice will not be required), access to
relevant properties and site utilities, in order to allow Seller and its
Representatives to respond to, defend, and conduct Remedial Action relating to
such Environmental Indemnity Matter; in connection with such access for the
purposes of performing any Remedial Action hereunder, Seller and its
Representatives shall not engage in any negligent act or negligent omission.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not unreasonably interfere with or disturb the
performance by Seller and its Representatives of any such Remedial Action. In
connection with any such Environmental Indemnity Matter which Seller is
defending or controlling, Seller shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed
relating to the progress of such Environmental Indemnity Matter (including
providing Buyer with copies of all material plans and reports prior to
submission to Governmental Authorities, providing Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such plans and reports and incorporating
Buyer's reasonable comments); (i) provide Buyer with reasonable advance notice
of any meetings with any Governmental Authorities and unless the Governmental
Authority objects, provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to attend such
meetings; (iii) comply in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws; (iv) conduct the defense or control of such Environmental
Indemnity Matter in a diligent commercially reasonable manner; (v) upon
completion of any Remedial Action use commercially reasonable efforts to
restore adversely affected portions, if any, of the Real Property; and (vi)
not unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the use or operations of the
property undergoing Remedial Action.

(d) Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Damages for
Environmental Indemnity Matters to the extent such Damages have been caused,
exacerbated, compounded or aggravated by the negligent acts or negligent
omissions of or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as of the
Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries), or any employee, agent, contractor, consultant, attorney,
tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee of any of the
foregoing.

(e) Except as provided in Section 11.06(b) with respect to applicable Remedial
Action standards, Seller shall have no Liability under this Agreement for any
Damages relating to any Environmental Indemnity Matters to the extent arising
from or relating to the coming into force of, or the change in, any
requirement or obligation set forth in any Environmental Law or Environmental
Permit, including any new or modified standard or requirement for Remedial
Action, first arising on or after Closing.

Section 11.07 Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (on behalf of
such Indemnified Party) under applicable insurance policies, indemnities or
other reimbursement arrangements (net of any deductible or co-pay amounts and
any other costs or expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith,
including all premiums and other costs of such insurance policies, or any
increase in premium payable by such Indemnified Party, or any retroactive
adjustment under any such policy, or costs or expenses incurred in connection
with pursuing a claim thereunder), and (ii) Tax benefit actually realized by
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising from the payment of any such
Damages in or prior to the Tax year in which the Damages were incurred or the
three (3) taxable years immediately following such Tax year (net of all out-
of-pocket costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable documented and out-
of-pocket advisors and attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in connection
with procuring such Tax benefit). If the Indemnified Party, in respect of any
claim, (x) receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from
any other Person responsible for any Damages for such claim, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for the
amount of Damages paid to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such claim, net of any expenses (including reasonable documented
and out-of-pocket advisors' and attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount or (y) actually realizes during
the three (3) year period referenced in Section 11.07(a)(ii) any Tax benefit
described in Section 11.07(a)(ii) subsequent to an indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Party that was not previously taken into account in the
indemnification payment, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such Tax benefit solely to the extent that it
relates to the indemnification payment previously received (as computed
pursuant to this Section 11.07(a), net of all out of pocket costs, fees and
expenses, including reasonable advisors and attorneys' fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with procuring such Tax benefit).

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that such amount was expressly
taken into account in the Final Closing Statement, or (ii) consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or other similar Damages,
except in the case of this clause (ii) to the extent such Damages have been
awarded to a third party with respect to a Third Party Claim for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for any
Damages relating to any matter to the extent of, where Seller is the
Indemnifying Party, the amount of any liability or reserve set forth on the
Balance Sheet regarding such matter.

(d) Each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage,
or from any indemnitors or other Person with whom there is a reimbursement
arrangement, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

(e) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any payment made pursuant to Article 8) shall be
treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

(f) Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any
Damages for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the
Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification
provision of this Agreement in respect of that Damage, the Indemnified Party
must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the
extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation
(less the Indemnified Party's reasonable costs of mitigation) within two
Business Days after the benefit is received.

(g) No party's ability or right to make a claim with respect to Damages
arising out of any breach, or facts constituting a breach, of this Agreement
or any Foreign Transfer Agreement will be affected by any investigation,
verification or examination by or any knowledge obtained by any party or by
anyone on behalf of any such party, or the fact that such party knew or should
have known of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation at any time, or the decision by such party to complete
the Closing.

Section 11.08 Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could have recovered
all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor")
based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall assign, or cause its Affiliates to assign, such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit
the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment. Section 11.09 Exclusivity. Buyer expressly waives and agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including, as of the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) and
their respective successors and assigns, to waive any rights and claims they
may have against Seller and its Affiliates, including claims for contribution
or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601, et
seq., or to any Hazardous Substances, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims
for breach of duty. After the Closing, Sections 2.11, 7.10 and 8.07, this
Article 11 and Section 13.08 shall provide the exclusive remedies for any
claim arising out of this Agreement, the Foreign Transfer Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; provided, that nothing herein
shall be construed to limit any remedy set forth in any other Transaction
Document; provided, further that nothing herein shall limit any party's rights
with respect to the other party's Fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Section 11.09 limits equitable relief pursuant to Section 13.08 with
respect to breach of any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 11.10 GST/HST Gross Up. If any payment made by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article 11, or by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Article 12, is
deemed by the Excise Tax Act (Canada) to include goods and services
tax/harmonized sales tax, or is deemed by any applicable provincial or
territorial legislation to include a similar value added or multistaged tax,
the amount of such payment shall be increased accordingly.

ARTICLE 12 
TERMINATION

Section 12.01 Grounds for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before November 13, 2017 (as may be extended by mutual written agreement
of Buyer and Seller, the "End Date"); provided, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has primarily caused or
primarily resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time;

(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if there shall be any Order (which shall be
final and nonappealable) that (A) makes consummation of the Closing illegal or
otherwise prohibited or (B) permanently restrains or enjoins Buyer or Seller
from consummating the Closing hereby, provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(c) shall not (x) apply in
respect of the China Approvals and (y) be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement has primarily caused or primarily resulted in such
Order;

(d) by Buyer, if any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have become untrue or if a failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred, in each case, such that if the breach or untruth was occurring on
the Closing Date the condition set forth in Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b), as
applicable, would not be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; provided, that Buyer may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 12.01(d) unless (i) such breach has not been
cured by the date which is thirty (30) days after Buyer notifies Seller of
such breach in writing and (ii) Buyer is not then in breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.03 not
to be satisfied;

(e) by Seller, if any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have become untrue or if a failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred, in each case, such that if the breach or untruth was occurring on
the Closing Date, the condition set forth in Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b), as
applicable, would not be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date; provided, that Seller may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 12.01(e) unless (i) such breach has not been
cured by the date which is thirty (30) days after Seller notifies Buyer of
such breach in writing and (ii) Seller is not then in breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.02 not
to be satisfied; or

(f) by Seller if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 and
Section 10.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature cannot be satisfied other than at the Closing, each of which would be
satisfied if there were a Closing at such time), (ii) Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing when the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.08, (iii) Seller has provided irrevocable written notice to Buyer no
earlier than the date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
Section 2.08 confirming that all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.03
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied other than at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied if
there were a Closing at such time) or that it will unconditionally waive any
such unsatisfied conditions, and that it intends to terminate this Agreement,
(iv) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days of
receipt of such irrevocable notice and (v) at all times during such three (3)
Business Day period, Seller and the applicable Retained Subsidiaries stood
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing.

Section 12.02 Effect of Termination. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated as permitted pursuant to Section 12.01, this Agreement shall become void and have no
further legal force or effect without any Liability or obligation on the part
of any party hereto (or any direct or indirect equity holder, stockholder,
member, manager, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or Representative of
such party or such party's Affiliates, or any of the foregoing's successors
and assigns), except that, subject in all respects to the following provisions
of this Section 12.02, Section 13.08 and Section 13.14 (including, in each
case, the limitations set forth therein), (i) the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Limited Guarantee shall survive in accordance with their respective
terms and conditions and (ii) the provisions of this Section 12.02, Section
5.02, the last sentence of Section 5.08(a), Section 6.01, Article 13 and any
related definitional provisions in Article 1, in each case, shall survive in
accordance with its terms and conditions; provided, that, nothing herein shall
relieve (x) Seller from any Liability for any knowing and willful breach of
this Agreement prior to such valid termination and (y) any party hereto of any
Liability for damages resulting from such party's Fraud prior to such valid
termination. The parties hereto agree that damages shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the
benefit of the bargain lost (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including opportunities cost and the time value of money).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by Seller
pursuant to Section 12.01(f) (or by Buyer pursuant to Section 12.01(b) at a
time when Seller is entitled to give the notice referred to in Section
12.01(f)), and Buyer's failure to consummate the Closing is as a result of
Buyer's failure to receive the proceeds of the Debt Financing in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter (unless Buyer's
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement is the primary cause
of such failure for the proceeds of the Debt Financing to not be funded), then
Buyer shall, in consideration of Seller's agreements set forth in Section
12.02(c), pay to Seller a fee of $13,000,000 (the "Financing Failure Reverse
Termination Fee") or (ii) (x) by Seller pursuant to Section 12.01(e) (or by
Buyer pursuant to Section 12.01(b) at a time when Seller is entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(e) (without giving effect
to the cure period set forth in clause (i) thereof to the extent relating to
any breach of which Buyer has not previously received notice)) or (y) by
Seller pursuant to Section 12.01(f) (or by Buyer pursuant to Section 12.01(b)
at a time when Seller is entitled to give the notice referred to in Section
12.01(f)), in each case in this clause (y) in circumstances in which the
Financing Failure Reverse Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to the
immediately preceding clause (i), then Buyer shall, in consideration of
Seller's agreements set forth in Section 12.02(c), pay to Seller a fee of
$32,500,000 (the "Breach Reverse Termination Fee"; each of the Breach Reverse
Termination and the Financing Failure Termination Fee to be referred to as a
"Reverse Termination Fee"). The Reverse Termination Fee, if, as and when
payable, shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such
payment to be made within two (2) Business Days of the applicable valid
termination (or, in the case of a termination by Buyer pursuant to Section
12.01(b), prior to or concurrently with such termination). The parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Reverse
Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 12.02(b),
shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which it is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Closing, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event and under no circumstances shall Buyer be required to
pay (1) both the Breach Reverse Termination Fee and the Financing Failure
Termination Fee, or (2) any Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, under no circumstances
can Seller or any other Person receive (A) both (i) an award of specific
performance or other equitable relief requiring consummation of the Closing or
the funding of the Equity Financing pursuant to Section 13.08 and (ii) (x)
payment of any Reverse Termination Fee or (y) monetary damages for Fraud or
(B) both (x) payment of the applicable Reverse Termination Fee and (y) any
monetary damages for Fraud.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, but subject in all respects to this Section 12.02, Section 13.08
and Section 13.14 (including, in each case, the limitations set forth
therein), if Buyer fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 2.08
for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein
(whether such breach is intentional, unintentional, willful or otherwise) or
fails to perform hereunder or thereunder or fails to perform any obligation
under Applicable Law relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (in
each case, whether such failure is intentional, unintentional, willful or
otherwise), then:

(i) if this Agreement is validly terminated in circumstances in which the
Financing Failure Reverse Termination Fee is due and payable, then Seller's
receipt of the Financing Failure Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section
12.02(b)(i), any amounts payable pursuant to Section 12.02(f) or the last
sentence of Section 5.08(a) (such interest and amounts, if, as and when
payable, collectively, "Additional Amounts") shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at Applicable Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of Seller, its respective Affiliates and any of their respective
stockholders, beneficiaries, directors, officers, employees, attorneys,
accountants, and other advisors or Representatives against Buyer Related
Parties for any breach, Liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or damage
suffered as a result thereof or in connection therewith or related thereto; or (ii) in each case, for any circumstance in which the Financing Failure Reverse
Termination Fee is not due and payable, then Seller's right to (A) a decree or
order of specific performance or any injunction or injunctions or other
equitable relief if and to the extent permitted by Section 13.08 or (B)
validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01 and receive payment
of the Breach Reverse Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to
Section 12.02(b)(ii), together with any Additional Amounts pursuant to the
applicable sections hereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether
at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Seller, its
respective Affiliates and any of their respective stockholders, beneficiaries,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors or
Representatives (and any other Person) against Buyer Related Parties for any
breach, Liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or damage suffered as a
result thereof or in connection therewith or related thereto.

(d) Upon payment of the applicable Reverse Termination Fee if, as and when
required pursuant to Section 12.02(b), and any Additional Amounts pursuant to
the applicable Sections hereof, except in the case of Fraud, none of Buyer,
its Affiliates or any of their respective, direct or indirect, former,
current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, Representatives, agents or assignees
("Buyer Related Party") will have any further Liability or obligation to
Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, beneficiaries,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors or
Representatives, including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any documents referenced herein
or therein or otherwise or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein or
therein, or the failure of such transactions to be consummated, or in respect
of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise or
based on this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other Contract,
document or theory of law or equity. Except as provided in Section 12.02(b)
with respect to Additional Amounts and the last sentence of 5.08(a), following
the valid termination of this Agreement none of Buyer Related Parties will
have any Liability or obligation whatsoever to Seller, its respective
Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, beneficiaries, directors,
officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors or
Representatives, including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any documents referenced herein
or therein or otherwise or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
any breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein or
therein, or the failure of such transactions to be consummated, or in respect
of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith or otherwise, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise or based on this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other Contract, document or
theory of law or equity. Seller acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Financing Sources, or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers,
members, Affiliates, employees, Representatives or agents shall have any
Liability or obligation to Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective
stockholders or directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, and
other advisors or Representatives (collectively, the "Financing Source Related
Parties") arising out of this Agreement or their breach or failure to perform
(whether willful, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of their
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, the maximum aggregate Liability of the Buyer Related Parties under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or otherwise collectively
(including monetary damages for fraud or breach, whether willful (including a
willful and material breach), intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance), in connection with the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the
Financing) to be consummated, or in respect of any representation made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, inclusive with any
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and any other payment to Seller in
connection with this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or otherwise,
shall not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to $32,500,000 plus
any Additional Amounts pursuant to the applicable Sections hereof (the
"Maximum Liability Amount"); provided, that in no event shall Seller, its
respective Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, beneficiaries,
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors or
Representatives (or any other Person) seek, directly or indirectly, to recover
against the Buyer Related Parties, or compel payment by the Buyer Related
Parties of, any damages or other payments whatsoever (including multiple,
consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in
excess of the Maximum Liability Amount or any of the foregoing limitations.

(f) If all or any portion of the applicable Reverse Termination Fee is not
paid when due pursuant to this Section 12.02, as determined pursuant to a
final and non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
unpaid portion of the applicable Reverse Termination Fee shall accrue interest
at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date of the valid termination of
this Agreement, from and including the date the applicable portion of the
Reverse Termination Fee was required to be paid until but excluding the date
of payment, and such accrued and unpaid interest shall be deemed part of such
Reverse Termination Fee. In the event any Action is commenced by Buyer for
payment of an applicable Reverse Termination Fee, and a final and non-appealable order is given in connection therewith, all reasonable and
documented out of pocket fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in such
Action shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party up to a maximum of
$1,500,000 (it being agreed that Buyer shall be the prevailing party if such
final and non-appealable order determines the Reverse Termination Fee sought
in such Action was not due and payable (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
if Seller sought the Breach Reverse Termination Fee in circumstances in which
the Financing Failure Reverse Termination Fee was due and payable), on the one
hand, and Seller shall be the prevailing party if such final and non-
appealable order determines the Reverse Termination Fee sought was due and
payable, on the other hand) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if Buyer
asserted that only the Financing Failure Reverse Termination Fee was payable
in circumstances in which the Breach Reverse Termination Fee was payable).

be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns; provided, that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under

or due to Buyer.

Section 13.05 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal law of the State of New York, without regard to the principles or

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY
(INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE DEBT FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE
DEBT FINANCING), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 13.06 Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the agreements, document and
transactions contemplated hereby (including in respect of the Debt Financing)
shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan within New York City, so long as one of such courts shall
have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and
that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 13.07 Counterparts; Effectiveness; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder or thereunder (whether by
virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except: (a) with
respect to Section 7.06, any legal counsel representing Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including any Purchased Subsidiary, in connection with the Current
Representation; (b) each Non-Recourse Party is an intended beneficiary of, and
shall have the right to enforce, the provisions set forth in Sections
12.02(d), 13.05(b), 13.06, Section 13.14 and the related definitions thereof;
and (c) each Financing Source (regardless of whether the Financing is
consummated) is an intended third party beneficiary of, and shall have the
right to enforce the provisions set forth in Section 13.14 and this Section 13.07 (and no amendment or modification to such provisions or to this
Section 13.07 in any respect adversely affecting the Financing Source or any
Financing Source Related Party may be made without the prior written consent
of the Financing Source).

Section 13.08 Specific Performance. (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) were not performed in accordance with the
specific terms hereof. It is accordingly agreed that, subject in all respects
to Section 13.08(b), the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent any breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement,
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
or thereof, in each case, in the courts described in Section 13.06 without
proof of damages or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all
defenses to any action for specific performance hereunder (other than any
defense that such remedy is sought in violation of the terms hereof, including
Section 13.08(b)), including any defense based on the claim that a remedy at
law would be adequate and any requirement to post a bond or other security as
a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 13.08(a) or otherwise in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Document to the contrary, (i) none of
Seller or its Affiliates (nor any director, officer, employee, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or Representative of the foregoing) shall be
entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
to cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates to enforce specifically their
respective rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) none of the
Seller or its Affiliates (nor any director, officer, employee, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or Representative of the foregoing) shall be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Buyer's obligation to
cause all or any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under
this Agreement or under the Equity Commitment Letter) or otherwise cause Buyer
to take action to consummate the Closing or the Equity Financing (including
the obligation to pay all or any portion of the Purchase Price) unless all of
the following conditions have been met, only upon which shall Seller be
entitled to enforce specifically Buyer\'s obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing: (w) Buyer is required to
consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 2.08, the Debt Financing has been
funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter, or such amount will be funded to Buyer at the Closing in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing (provided, that Buyer shall not be required
to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter to fund the Equity Financing or
consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact funded at the
Closing), (y) Seller has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed in writing
to Buyer that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur (and Seller has not revoked, modified or
conditioned such confirmation), and (z) Buyer failed to complete the Closing
when required by Section 2.08.

(c) Notwithstanding anything else herein or in any other Transaction Document
to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt, while Seller may, subject in all
respects to Section 12.02, Section 13.14 and this Section 13.08 (including, in
each case, the limitations set forth therein), concurrently seek (i) specific
performance or other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this Section
13.08 and (ii) (x) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, if, as and when
required pursuant to Section 12.02(b), and any applicable Additional Amounts,
or (y) monetary damages for Fraud, under no circumstances shall Seller,
directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on
the one hand, and (x) payment of any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee,
if, as and when due pursuant to Section 12.02(b) and any Additional Amounts,
or (y) monetary damages for fraud, on the other hand. In the event the Reverse
Termination Fee is due and payable and paid, neither Seller (nor any other
Person) shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to
seek any injunctive or similar relief to prevent any breaches or threatened
breaches of any provision of any document to be executed in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby by any Buyer Related Party. The
provisions of this Section 13.08 are expressly intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, any of Buyer and its Affiliates.

Section 13.09 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and Disclosure
Schedule constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede and cancel all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both oral and written, express
and implied, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

Section 13.10 Bulk Sales Laws. Buyer and Seller each hereby waive compliance
by Seller with the provisions of the "bulk sales", "bulk transfer" or similar
laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets.

Section 13.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement, or application thereof, is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 13.12 Disclosure Schedule. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
matters reflected on the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required to be reflected therein, (a) the disclosure by Seller of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgement by Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the
terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material, (a) if any section of
the Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in response to a
representation and warranty in such a way as to make its relevance to the
disclosure required by or provided in another section of the Disclosure
Schedule with respect to a different representation and warranty reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure made without review of any
referenced material, the matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or
with respect to such other section, notwithstanding the omission of an
appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the omission of a
reference in the particular representation and warranty to such section of the
Disclosure Schedule, (i) except as provided in clause (i) above, headings have
been inserted in the Disclosure Schedule for convenience of reference only,
(i) the Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to
specific provisions of this Agreement and (i) the Disclosure Schedule and the
information and statements contained therein are not intended to constitute,

limiting the generality of the foregoing, all references in the Disclosure
Schedule to the enforceability of agreements with third parties, the existence
or non-existence of third-party rights, the absence or existence of breaches
or defaults by Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or third parties, or similar
matters or statements, are not intended to be admissions against interests,
give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy or be admissible against any
party by or in favor of any Person who is not a party to this Agreement.

Section 13.13 Currency. For purposes of Section 2.08(a)(iii) and Section
2.07(b), the China Consideration shall be converted from U.S. dollars to
Chinese renminbi using the CNY/USD rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal
on the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 13.13 shall not impact the calculation of Closing Working
Capital or any amounts set forth on the Audited Financial Statements,
Unaudited Financial Statements or June 30 HFM Management Financial Statements.

Section 13.14 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any document,
certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith or
otherwise, each party hereby acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and
its respective Affiliates, that, except in the case of fraud, all actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings that may be based upon, in
respect of, arise under, out of, by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (a) this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated

Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, any of the
foregoing documents), (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document and (d) the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or by any other Transaction Document, to be

applicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereby acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its respective
Affiliates, that, except in the case of fraud, no recourse under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in connection with any
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be sought or had against any

otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted

liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine) for any losses,
damages, claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities of any nature
whatsoever arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner
to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d), it being
