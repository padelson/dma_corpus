This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of March 5, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), is entered into by and among COMPOUND HOLDINGS II, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), COMPOUND HOLDINGS I, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Seller_ "), Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish public limited
company (" _Parent_ "), solely for purposes of _Section 9.21,_ and
Mallinckrodt Enterprises LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Purchaser_ "). Defined terms used but not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in _Section 9.14_.

_W I T N E S S E T H_

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company, which consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Stock_ "); and

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Purchaser desires to acquire from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Purchaser, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company Stock (the
" _Purchased Shares_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Seller, Purchaser and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE COMPANY STOCK

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Company Stock_. Upon and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall
sell, assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase
and acquire from Seller, the Purchased Shares, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than those imposed by applicable securities Laws. As
consideration for the Purchased Shares, upon and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller the Closing Consideration and deliver to the Escrow Agent the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount.

1.02 _Initial Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, the Company shall prepare (and, if requested by
Purchaser, in consultation with Purchaser), and at least four Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser, a written
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth:

 

(i) the Companys good faith estimate and supporting calculations of (I) the
Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Cash Amount_ "), (II) the Net Working Capital
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (III) the Indebtedness Amount (the
" _Estimated Indebtedness Amount_ ") and (IV) the Transaction Expenses Amount
(the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses Amount_ "); (ii) payment instructions for the payment of the Closing Consideration;

 

(iii) a list of and, as applicable, payment instructions for the payment of,
each of the Transaction Expenses included in the Estimated Transaction
Expenses Amount; and

(iv) the calculation of the Initial Purchase Price and Closing Consideration
derived therefrom.

 

(b) During the preparation of the Closing Statement (if requested by
Purchaser) and after the delivery of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and its
Representatives shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and to discuss
with the Company and its Representatives (a) the Companys and its
Subsidiaries working papers and the working papers of the Companys
independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Cash Amount, Estimated Net
Working Capital, Estimated Indebtedness Amount and Estimated Transaction
Expenses Amount and (b) the relevant books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the Cash Amount, the Net Working Capital, the
Indebtedness Amount or the Transaction Expenses Amount; and the Company and
its Representatives shall reasonably assist Purchaser and its representatives
in their review of the Closing Statement and the preparation thereof and
reasonably cooperate with respect thereto. In the event Purchaser notifies the
Company in writing prior to the Closing that it disputes any amount set forth
in the Closing Statement, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable prior to the
Closing Date. If, prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the Company agree in
writing to any component on the Closing Statement, then such components of
the Closing Statement shall be modified as so agreed. The Closing shall not be
delayed if Purchaser and the Company are unable, after any such cooperation,
to agree on all of the components of the Closing Statement and, except as
otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Company in writing, the parties shall
use the Closing Statement as delivered by the Company for purposes of
determining the Closing Consideration (without limiting any of the provisions
of this Agreement, including _Article II_ ).

(c) From 12:00 a.m. on the Closing Date and until the Closing, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any dividend
or distributions of Cash or incur any Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses
(other than as a result of the Financing or as already fully reflected in the
Closing Statement) or use any Cash to pay any Transaction Expenses or to repay
any Indebtedness. If, as a result of a breach by the Company of any of its
covenants contained in this _Section 1.02(c)_, Cash, Transaction Expenses
or Indebtedness shall have changed between 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and the time immediately preceding the Closing,
then any such changes shall be included in the calculation of Cash Amount,
Transaction Expenses Amount and/or Indebtedness Amount (as the case may be)
for purposes of the Closing Statement.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement,

 



2 (i) the term " _Initial Purchase Price_ " means (i) $2,300,000,000,  _minus_
(ii) the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, _plus_ (iii) the Estimated Cash
Amount, _plus_ (iv) the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount (if a positive number), (v) _minus_ the absolute value of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if a negative
number), _minus_ (vi) the Estimated Transaction Expenses Amount, and _minus_
(vii) the amount, if any, of the Downside EBITDA Adjustment Amount, and

(ii) the term " _Closing Consideration_ " means the Initial Purchase Price,
_minus_ the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount.

ARTICLE II

2.01 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on
the date that is three Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), or on such other date, time or place as is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto (the date on which the Closing actually
occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , (i) in no event may
the Closing take place earlier than April 15, 2015 and (ii) in no event may
the Closing occur without the written consent of Purchaser unless either (A)
the Company shall have delivered to Purchaser the Financing Information and
such Financing Information shall have been Compliant for a minimum of fifteen
(15) consecutive Business Days through and including the Closing Date or (B)
the Purchaser shall have consummated the Financing.

 

2.02 _Closing Deliveries and Payments_.

 

(a) _Purchaser Closing Deliveries and Payments_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to (i) Seller at the Closing an amount in cash equal to the
Closing Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designed in writing by Seller and (ii) the Escrow Agent
at the Closing an amount in cash equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Escrow Agent, to be held and disbursed
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) _Seller Closing Deliveries_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser at the Closing the following:

 

(i) with respect to the Purchased Shares, certificates representing all of
such Purchased Shares, duly endorsed (or accompanied by duly executed
transfer powers) for transfer to Purchaser;

 



3 (ii) a FIRPTA statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and in
compliance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), certifying that
Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the
Code; and

 

(iii) unless Purchaser requests otherwise, a resignation from each individual
serving as a director of the Company or its Subsidiaries, effective as of the
Closing, resigning from his or her position as director of the Company and
each Subsidiary of the Company.

2.03  _Other Closing Payments_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries (a) all
amounts necessary to discharge fully the then outstanding balance of all
Indebtedness set forth in _Section 2.03_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(but only to the extent such amounts were included in the Estimated
Indebtedness Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the holders of
such Indebtedness, and (b) each of the unpaid Transaction Expenses in
accordance with the Closing Statement.

 

2.04 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith
calculations of the Cash Amount, the Net Working Capital, the Indebtedness
Amount and the Transaction Expenses Amount, together with such schedules and
data with respect to the determination thereof as may be appropriate to
support the calculations set forth in the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.
The foregoing items shall be calculated by the Company in accordance with
this Agreement and _Exhibit A_ hereto.

(b) Following the delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and
until the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement has become final and binding as
set forth in _Section 2.04(h)_, Purchaser and the Company shall provide
Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access to the books and records
and relevant personnel and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
well as to any documents or work papers used in the preparation of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as Seller may reasonably request.

 

(c) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of any of the items set forth in
the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (each, an " _Objection Dispute_ "),
Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing thereof (such notification, a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement by Seller, and shall set forth in such Dispute Notice in
reasonable detail the particulars of any such disagreement, including (if
Seller has sufficient substantiating information) its calculation of each
disputed item. If Seller fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement to Seller (or only delivers a Dispute Notice as to a specific
portion or portions of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement), or if Seller
notifies Purchaser in writing that it will not deliver a Dispute Notice, then
the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (or such portion of it that is not in
dispute) shall be final and binding on Purchaser, the Company, Seller and any
other person for purposes of this Agreement.

 



4 (d) If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve each Objection Dispute, and any resolution agreed to
in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and binding on Purchaser,
the Company, Seller and any other person for purposes of this Agreement. If
Purchaser and Seller are able to resolve all of the Objection Disputes, then
the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, adjusted to reflect such resolution
of all Objection Disputes, shall be final and binding on Purchaser, the
Company, Seller and any other person for purposes of this Agreement. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all Objection Disputes within
twenty (20) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice by Seller to Purchaser
(the " _Negotiation Period_ "), then Purchaser and Seller shall jointly
appoint the Accounting Arbitrator as provided below in this _Section 2.04(d)_
and the Objection Disputes that have not been resolved shall, at the request
of either Seller or Purchaser, be referred for final determination to the
Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the end of the
Negotiation Period, and if any Dispute Notice did not contain a calculation of
the amount of the disputed item, Seller shall provide a calculation of the
amount of such disputed item to the Purchaser and the Accounting Arbitrator
within such fifteen (15) day period. Purchaser and Seller shall jointly
appoint an accounting or valuation firm of national standing that is not the
independent auditor of (and does not otherwise provide services under a
contractual arrangement with) either Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) or
Seller (or any of its Affiliates (excluding private equity fund portfolio
companies)) to be the accounting arbitrator for purposes of this _Section
2.04_ (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "); provided that if Purchaser and Seller
are unable to agree upon such firm within ten (10) days after the end of the
Negotiation Period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an accounting or
valuation firm of national standing appointed by the American Arbitration
Association in New York, New York; _provided_ that such firm shall not be the
independent auditor of (or otherwise provide services under a contractual
arrangement with) either Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) or Seller (or
any of its Affiliates (excluding private equity fund portfolio companies)).

 

(e) Purchaser and Seller shall make available to the Accounting Arbitrator the
books and records and relevant personnel and properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as well as any documents or work papers used in the
preparation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and the Dispute Notice,
and all other items reasonably requested by the Accounting Arbitrator, and
shall submit to the Accounting Arbitrator a list of all Objection Disputes
that have been resolved by Purchaser and Seller. The Accounting Arbitrator
shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as practicable (and in any
event shall endeavor to do so within thirty (30) days after its appointment),
a written report (i) setting forth (A) the resolution of each Objection
Dispute that had been submitted to it, determined in accordance with the
provisions of this  _Section 2.04_ and _Exhibit A_ hereto, and (B) any
adjustments that are required to be made to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement to reflect such resolution, and (ii) which shall have attached
thereto a Purchase Price Adjustment Statement that has been revised to
reflect (x) the resolution of any Objection Disputes by Purchaser and Seller,
and (y) the adjustments, if any, referred to in clause (i)(B) of this sentence
(the " _Arbitrator s Report_").

(f) The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those Objection Disputes
submitted to it for resolution. In resolving each such Objection Dispute, the
Accounting Arbitrator (i) shall resolve such Objection Dispute in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 2.04_ and _Exhibit A_ hereto, (ii)
shall make its determination based solely on the presentations and supporting
material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not pursuant to any

 



5  independent review, and (iii) may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or
Seller. The Arbitrators Report shall be final and binding upon Purchaser, the
Company, Seller and any other person for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(g) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne
by Purchaser in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items
that are successfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the items
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator and by Seller in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items that are unsuccessfully
disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Accounting Arbitrator) bears
to the aggregate dollar amount of the items submitted to the Accounting
Arbitrator.

 

(h) The Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (i) that has become final and
binding pursuant to the last sentence of  _Section 2.04(c)_ or the second
sentence of _Section 2.04(d)_, or (ii) that is included in the Arbitrators
Report, as applicable, shall be the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement that
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser, the Company, Seller and any other
person for purposes of this Agreement (the " _Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement_ "). The Cash Amount, the Net Working Capital, the Indebtedness
Amount and the Transaction Expenses Amount, each as shown on the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, shall be referred to as the " _Final Cash
Amount_ ," the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ," the " _Final Indebtedness
Amount_ ," and the " _Final Transaction Expenses Amount_ ," respectively.

(i) If (i) the _sum_ of the Final Cash Amount, _plus_  the Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount (if a positive number), _minus_ the Final
Indebtedness Amount, minus the Final Transaction Expenses Amount, _minus_ the
absolute value of the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if
a negative number), _exceeds_ (ii) the sum of the Estimated Cash Amount,
_plus_ the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if a
positive number), _minus_ the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, minus the
Estimated Transaction Expenses Amount, _minus_ the absolute value of the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if a negative number)
(such excess, the " _Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ "), then
Seller shall be entitled to receive from Purchaser a payment in cash equal to
the Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount.

(j) If (i) the  _sum_ of the Estimated Cash Amount, _plus_ the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if a positive number), _minus_
the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, minus the Estimated Transaction Expenses
Amount, _minus_  the absolute value of the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount (if a negative number), _exceeds_ (ii) the _sum_ of
the Final Cash Amount, _plus_ the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(if a positive number), _minus_ the Final Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ the
Final Transaction Expenses Amount, _minus_ the absolute value of the Final Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount (if a negative number), (such excess, the "
_Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ "), then Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive solely out of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, a
payment in cash equal to the Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount but not
in excess of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, and Purchaser and
Seller shall, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement has become final and binding pursuant to
_Section 2.04(h)_, deliver a joint

 



6  written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to make such payment. Seller
shall not have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to this _Section
2.04_ in excess of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, and Purchasers
sole source of recourse and recovery for such amounts due shall be the funds
available in the escrow account of the Escrow Agent holding the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 

(k) In the event of a Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, or if the
amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund _exceeds_  the Negative
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, or if there is neither a Positive Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount nor a Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount,
Purchaser and Seller shall, within three (3) Business Days after the date
on which the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement has become final and binding
pursuant to _Section 2.04(h)_, deliver a joint written notice instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay the Unused Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to
Seller. The funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund may
be distributed to Purchaser and/or Seller solely and exclusively in accordance
with this _Section 2.04_ and shall not be available for any other payment to
Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.

2.05 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, Purchaser and the Company shall be permitted and entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
under applicable Tax Law,  _provided_ that, if Purchaser determines that an
amount is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to any amounts
payable hereunder, at least five (5) days prior to the date the applicable
payment is scheduled to be made, Purchaser shall provide Seller with written
notice of its intent to deduct and withhold, which notice shall include a copy
of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and reference to
the applicable provision of Law pursuant to which such deduction and
withholding is required, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller
to eliminate or reduce such deduction or withholding in accordance with
applicable Tax Law (including by providing Seller with a
reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt
such amount from withholding). Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Purchaser or the
Company, as applicable, shall disburse such deducted or withheld amounts to
the applicable Taxing Authority. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser in Purchasers determination of whether any withholding is required
with respect to any amounts payable hereunder.

The Company represents and warrants to Purchaser that, except as disclosed in
the correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Purchaser simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of

shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this _Article
III_ to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face):

 

3.01 _Organization_. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has

and is in good standing in all jurisdictions where the nature of the property
owned or leased by the Company, or the nature of the business conducted by the

licensed, qualified and in good standing has not had and would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the
organizational documents (the " _Constituent Documents_ ") of the Company have
been made available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof, and no amendment
or other modification has been filed, recorded or is pending or contemplated
with respect thereto. The Constituent Documents of the Company are in full

warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, commitments
or any other agreements to which the Company is a party or by which the
Company is bound that obligate the Company to (i) issue, deliver or sell or

of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital stock or equity awards

deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions

Permit or Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
except solely with respect to clause (B) for violations, conflicts, breaches,

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

3.04 _Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all of the
Subsidiaries of the Company. The Company does not presently own, directly or

Company are duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in
all jurisdictions where the nature of the property owned or leased by them,

9  company interests or other equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries. All
such capital stock and interests are held free and clear of all Encumbrances,
except as imposed by applicable securities laws. All issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests or other equity
interests of each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued, are
fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of preemptive
or other similar rights. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, commitments
or any other agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a

obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) issue, deliver or sell
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold any shares of capital stock, limited
liability company interests or other equity interests of any Subsidiary of

capital stock, limited liability company interests or other equity interests
of any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests or other
equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or similar rights outstanding with
respect to any Subsidiary of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies
or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting or transfer of any
capital stock or limited liability company interests of any Subsidiary of the
Company.

 

3.05 _Financial Statements_. The Company Disclosure Schedule contains (i) the
audited consolidated financial statements of Ikaria, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and
2013 and the audited consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders deficit, comprehensive income and cash flows of Ikaria, Inc. and
its Subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the notes
thereto (the " _Audited 2013 Financial Statements_ "), and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Ikaria, Inc. and its Subsidiaries, which
comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, the unaudited consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders (deficit) equity,
comprehensive (loss) income and cash flows of Ikaria, Inc. and
its Subsidiaries for the periods January 1, 2014 through February 11, 2014
and February 12, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which
comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity,
comprehensive (loss) income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the year ended December 31, 2014 (the " _Unaudited 2014 Financial
Statements_ " and, together with the Audited 2013 Financial Statements and,
following their delivery pursuant to _Section 6.15_, the Audited 2014
Financial Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "), a true and complete
copy of each of which, other than the Audited 2014 Financial Statements, is
included in the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Financial Statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and the results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of their respective dates
and for the respective periods then ended in conformity with GAAP consistently
applied, except as set forth in the notes thereto and, in the case of the
Unaudited 2014 Financial Statements, subject to the absence of footnote
disclosure and to normal end-of-period adjustments (which end-of-period
adjustments will be consistent in subject and nature with the year-
end adjustments made in connection with the Audited 2013 Financial
Statements). The Companys and each of its Subsidiaries system of internal
controls over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are

 



10  recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, consistently applied. Since December 31, 2012, no
officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
refused to execute any certification of any nature whatsoever required by Law
or requested by any accounting, banking, financial, or legal firm or entity.

committed to pay or award, any bonuses or incentive compensation, (C) hired

ordinary course of business that will be prepayable at the Closing and did not
exceed $5,000,000 in aggregate amount, (B) made any (or forgiven, cancelled
or guaranteed any) loans, advances or capital contributions to any Person,
except loans, advances or capital contributions in an aggregate amount that
did not exceed $1,000,000 solely to Persons other than Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), or (C) made any
loans from any Subsidiary of the Company located outside the United States to
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company located in the United States;

Audited 2014 Financial Statements) or disclosed in the notes to the Financial
Statements (other than the Audited 2014 Financial Statements), (b) liabilities
incurred since the date of the Unaudited 2014 Financial Statements in the

the Company Disclosure Schedule (but excluding liabilities or obligations
under such Contracts arising from any breach that has occurred or
indemnification with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing) and
(d) liabilities that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.08 _Title to Assets; Real Property_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good (and, in the case of real
property, marketable) title to all of the assets and properties which they
purport to own and which are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(b) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of all of the Owned Real Property. With respect to each Owned Real Property,
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns a fee simple estate in such
Owned Real Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances. None of the Owned Real Property is subject to any right or
option of any other Person to purchase or lease an interest in such Owned
Real Property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement or option to purchase any real property or interest therein.

 

(c) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of all of the Leased Real Property and all real property leases to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as lessee or lessor
(collectively, the " _Real Property Leases_ "). With respect to each Leased
Real Property, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has a valid
leasehold interest in such Leased Real Property, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in material default under or in material breach of, or
in receipt of any written claim of material default under or material breach
of, any of the Real Property Leases and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no

 



13  other party to any of the Real Property Leases is in material default under
or in material breach of any of the Real Property Leases. Each of the Real
Property Leases constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries and is enforceable against the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, against the other party or
parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.
The other party to each Real Property Lease is not an affiliate of,
and otherwise does not have any economic interest in, the Company or any
Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has subleased,
licensed or otherwise granted any Person the right, on or after the date
hereof, to use or occupy any Leased Real Property or any portion thereof.

(d) All buildings, structures, improvements, fixtures, building systems and
equipment, and all components thereof, included in the Real Property (the "
_Improvements_ ") are in good condition and repair and sufficient for the
operation of the Business. There are no structural deficiencies or latent
defects affecting any of the Improvements and there are no facts or
conditions affecting any of the Improvements which would, individually or in
the aggregate, interfere in any material respect with the use or occupancy of
the Improvements or any portion thereof in the operation of the Business.

3.09 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of all registered United States and foreign Intellectual Property that are
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together with any other
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ "). The conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as now being conducted does
not infringe, violate, dilute or constitute the misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property of others and, to the Knowledge of the Company, (i)
there are no facts indicating a likelihood of the foregoing and (ii) none of
the Company Intellectual Property has been or is being infringed, violated,
diluted or misappropriated by others. There is no Litigation or other demand,
inquiry, cease and desist notice or other notice of violation pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, based on any claim or allegation that the operation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates, dilutes or
otherwise violates any Intellectual Property right of any third party. The
Company solely and exclusively owns all right, title and interest, free and
clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, in and to the
Company Intellectual Property, and all such registrations and, where
applicable, applications, are in good standing with, and all applicable fees
have been paid to, the Governmental Authority with which they are registered
or pending. With respect to any Intellectual Property not constituting
Company Intellectual Property but reasonably necessary for the operation of
the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries business as currently conducted,
the Company has a valid and enforceable license to use such Intellectual
Property pursuant to a written license agreement set forth on the Company
Disclosure Schedule (other than commercially available, off-the-shelf, click-
wrap, shrink-wrap or similar licenses). The Company Intellectual Property,
together with the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to a written license
agreement set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than
commercially available, off-the-shelf, click-wrap, shrink-wrap or
similar licenses), constitute all

 



14  of the Intellectual Property reasonably necessary to conduct the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. All of the material
Company Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. For the avoidance of
doubt, except for the second sentence of this _Section 3.09(a)_, nothing in
this _Section 3.09_ shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty that
the conduct of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries respective
businesses does not infringe, violate, dilute or misappropriate the
Intellectual Property of others.

 

(b) The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of all material license agreements granting any right (whether contingent or
otherwise) to use or practice any rights under any Intellectual Property,
except for commercially available, off-the-shelf, click-wrap, shrink-wrap or
similar licenses and licenses granted in the ordinary course of business
(each, an " _IP License Agreement_ "). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in material default under or in material breach of, or in
receipt of any written claim of default under or breach of, any IP License
Agreement listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no other party to any such IP License Agreement is in default
under or in breach of any such IP License Agreement, and each of the IP
License Agreements constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable against the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, against the other party or
parties thereto, in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.
The Company has made available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof a true
and complete copy, as in effect on the date hereof, of each of the IP License
Agreements listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has exclusively licensed any Company Intellectual
Property to any third party. No government funding, facilities of a
university, college, other educational institution or research center, or
funding from third parties was used in the creation or development of any
Company Intellectual Property.

 

(c) The Company has taken (and caused each of its Subsidiaries to take) all
commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of its
trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have executed valid written confidentiality and
invention assignment contracts with all of its past and present employees,
contractors and consultants engaged or retained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2012, and involved in the development or
creation of material Intellectual Property, pursuant to which they have
assigned to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries all their rights in and to
all Intellectual Property they develop and agreed to hold all trade secrets
and confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in confidence both during and after their engagement. Since
January 1, 2012, and to the Knowledge of the Company prior to the date
thereof, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns all right, title and
interest in and to all material Intellectual Property developed or created by
any employee, contractor or consultant engaged or retained by the Company.
Each Company product covered by a claim of any patent constituting Company
Intellectual Property is accurately marked with such applicable existing
patent(s).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section
3.09_, together with _Sections 3.03(b)_,  _3.06_ , _3.07_ , _3.10_ , _3.11_
, _3.12_ , and _3.19_ , contain the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company in any way relating to any Intellectual Property
matter.

(a) Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as of
the date hereof, of each Contract (other than Contracts described in clause

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller and the Company that, except as

delivered by Purchaser to Seller and the Company simultaneously with the

Subsidiaries is a party, except for Impacts which would not have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.03 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Litigation pending or,
to Purchasers knowledge, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries which would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding Orders which would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



30 5.04 _Governmental Approvals_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.04_ of
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, and except for compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act, no Governmental Approval is required
to be obtained or made by Purchaser in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement or the taking by it of any
other action contemplated hereby, other than such Governmental Approvals
which, if not obtained or made, would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect
(it being understood that, in making the representations and warranties
contained in this _Section 5.04_, Purchaser is relying on the information and
documents furnished by the Company and Seller).

 

5.05 _Solvency_. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is
being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with
the actual intent of Purchaser to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (i) that
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
are true and correct in all material respects, (ii) the compliance with and
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and (iii) that any
estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by or on behalf of the Company
that have been provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were reasonable when made,
at and immediately after the Closing, and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions to Purchasers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Article VII_ , immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Parent and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (a) will be solvent (in that both the
fair value of their assets will not be less than the sum of their debts and
that the present fair saleable value of their assets will not be less than the
amount required to pay their probable liabilities on their debts as they
become absolute and matured), (b) will not have unreasonably small capital to
conduct their businesses in which they are engaged and (c) will not have
incurred and will not intend to incur debts that they do not believe that
they will be able to pay as they become due (whether at maturity or
otherwise).

5.06 _Financing_. Purchaser has delivered to Seller true, correct and
complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) the executed Debt
Commitment Letter and (ii) the executed Debt Fee Letter (redacted as to fee
amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any dollar amount or percentage set forth in the flex terms) only,
none of which would materially adversely affect the amount or availability of
the Financing). As of the date of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates has entered into any side letters or other agreements
related to the Financing, which would impose conditions or other contingencies
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing. The Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter have not been amended or modified, except as
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.12_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect
and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Mallinckrodt International
Finance S.A. (" _MIFSA_ "), an Affiliate of Purchaser, and, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each case except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.
Purchaser or Purchasers ultimate parent has caused MIFSA to fully pay (or
cause to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees that

 



31  are required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter,
any related engagement letter and the Debt Fee Letter on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. The net proceeds of the Financing, if funded in accordance
with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with cash and cash equivalents
available to Purchaser and its Affiliates, including under its committed
credit facilities, shall, in the aggregate, be sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and the payment of all associated costs and expenses. As of the
date of this Agreement, Purchaser has no reason to believe that MIFSA will
be unable to satisfy any term or condition required to be satisfied by it as
a condition to the availability of the Financing contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition
on the part of MIFSA or, to the knowledge of MIFSA, the other parties thereto,
under the Debt Commitment Letter. Except as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the
financial institutions specified in the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the
full amount of the Financing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations hereunder are not subject to the receipt or availability of any
funds or financing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.07 _Brokers_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has paid or become
obligated to pay, or will pay or become obligated to pay, any fee, commission
or similar payment to any investment bank, financial advisor, broker, finder,
intermediary or any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller will be liable.

of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: each party hereto
agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates to, (A) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable and in any event
within ten Business Days after the date hereof (unless the

 



36  parties otherwise agree to a different date), (B) supply as soon as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section
6.04_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable. Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees under the
HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws applicable to Purchaser. Purchaser shall
cause the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early
termination."

(c) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to: (i) promptly
notify the other parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the other
parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other parties of the contents of) any communication to such Person from a
Governmental Authority and permit the other parties to review and discuss in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other parties
in relation to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental
Authority, (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed of
any developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or
discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
without giving the other parties prior notice of such meeting or discussions
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend or participate. However, each of Purchaser and the Company may
designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such information shall
not be shared with employees, officers, directors or their equivalents of the
other party without approval of the party providing the non-public
information.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.04_,
Purchaser agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to take, any and all
steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and
obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws
that may be required by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties
to close the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than three Business Days prior to the End Date), including
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or
otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of
assets or businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii)
terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect, or accept any Remedial Action if
such Remedial Action would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any Remedial Action shall be conditioned upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Subject to the foregoing, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced or threatened
under any Antitrust Law or by any Governmental Authority challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby

 



37  and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to avoid or resolve any such litigation, action or
proceeding and each of the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than
three Business Days prior to the End Date.

 

(f) Purchaser shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates to, acquire or
agree to acquire any right, asset, business, Person or division thereof
(through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise) if
such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk
of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.05 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Purchaser, the Company and Seller. Following such initial press
release and until the Closing, Purchaser, the Company and Seller shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system (and
then only after as much advance notice and consultation as is feasible);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.05_ shall not apply to any release or public statement in connection with
any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal announcements to their
respective employees and other stockholders that are not inconsistent in any
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Purchaser
(or any Affiliate thereof) may file this Agreement, including a summary
thereof, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

6.06 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
afford to Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Companys properties, books, Contracts and records and
the Company shall furnish promptly to Purchaser such information concerning
its business and properties as such party may reasonably request; _provided_
that Purchaser and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not
be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines,
in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable

 



38  Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party,
or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege (provided that
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access
or information in an alternative manner that does not have the foregoing
effects). Until the Closing, the information provided will be subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (i) had an opportunity to
discuss the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the management
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) has had access to the books and
records, facilities, contracts and other assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which it and its Representatives have requested to review, (iii)
has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers
from officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (iv) has conducted its
own independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, their
businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates that
have received Confidential Information directly or indirectly from Seller
(or, solely with respect to Confidential Information received prior to Closing
or after the Closing pursuant to _Section 6.07_, from the Company or its
Subsidiaries) to, keep confidential all confidential and proprietary
information of the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Confidential
Information_ "); _provided_ , however, that (x) the foregoing obligation
shall not apply to any Confidential Information that (i) is or becomes
available to the public (other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
6.06(c)_), or (ii) is or becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than Seller or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, so long as such source is not known by such
Person (after reasonable inquiry) to be subject to another
confidentiality obligation to the Company or its Affiliates, (y) nothing
herein shall restrict Seller or any its Affiliates from disclosing (A)
financial return or other financial performance or statistical information
(e.g., levels of debt, debt paydown or cash flows) in connection with its
normal fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting activities to
current and potential equityholders or investors, provided that any recipient
thereof is subject to a confidentiality obligation with respect thereto
and/or (B) Confidential Information in connection with any dispute with
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries related to this Agreement
and (z) Seller and its Affiliates may disclose Confidential Information to
the extent required by applicable Law or legal or administrative process,
provided that Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser (to the extent legally
permissible) in advance of such disclosure so that Purchaser may seek, at
Purchasers sole expense (and Seller will commercially reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in seeking) a protective order or other appropriate remedy in
lieu of or with respect to such disclosure and/or waive compliance with this
_Section 6.06(c)_, and to the extent legally permissible, Seller will
attempt to obtain, at Purchasers sole expense, reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to the information ultimately
furnished. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges
that certain of Sellers Affiliates are, and certain of their representatives
and Affiliates may be, registered investment advisors or regulated financial
institutions and thus subject to routine examinations, investigations,
regulatory sweeps or other regulatory inquiries, and agree that such Persons
and their representatives and Affiliates shall not be required to comply with
the process described in clause (z) of the preceding sentence of this 
_Section 6.06(c)_ in respect of disclosures made to a regulatory agency,
self-regulatory

 



39  organization, governmental agency or examiner thereof in the course of any
such routine examinations, investigations, sweeps or inquiries not
specifically relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any such disclosure shall be permitted.

6.07 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, for a period
of seven years, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide
Seller and its authorized Representatives with reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, solely for the purpose of
complying with applicable Tax Laws or for a proper purpose to the extent
related to transactions occurring at or prior to the Closing to which Seller
is a party or to the ownership of equity interests of Seller, to (a) the
books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the
Closing and (b) employees of Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates
for purposes of better understanding of such books and records; _provided_
that Seller and its authorized Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser and the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege
(provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such access or information in an alternative manner that does not
have the foregoing effects). Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Seller, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries relating to Tax matters or transactions occurring
at or prior to the Closing to which Seller is a party or to the ownership of
equity interests of Seller for any period prior to the Closing Date without
first giving reasonable prior notice to Seller and offering to surrender to
Seller such books and records or any portion thereof that Purchaser or the
Company or its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

6.08 _Contact with Employees, Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
Purchaser and its Representatives may only contact and communicate with the
employees, customers, service providers, regulators (other than regulators
pursuant to Antitrust Laws) and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
related to the transactions contemplated hereby (i) after prior consultation
with and written approval of a director or officer of the Company that the
Company Board has designated and authorized to provide such approvals under
this _Section 6.08_, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned and (ii) in compliance with Antitrust Laws.

6.09 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current and former director,
officer and employee of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and each
person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_
" and, collectively, the 

 



40  " _Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Closing (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of
liability, exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as
provided in (A) the Constituent Documents of the Company and the Constituent
Documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (B)
any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee that have been provided to
Purchaser prior to the date hereof and that are listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which shall in each case survive the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by applicable Law in accordance with the terms thereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, following the Closing, the Company shall not, and
Purchaser shall cause the Company not to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees, except as
required by applicable Law.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Claim relating to any acts
or omissions covered under this _Section 6.09_ or the enforcement of an
Indemnitees rights under this _Section 6.09_ as and when incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses (but
only to the extent required by applicable Law, the Constituent Documents of
the Company, applicable Constituent Documents of Subsidiaries of the Company
or applicable indemnification agreements as currently in effect). Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnitees
conduct complies with an applicable standard under applicable Law, the
Constituent Documents of the Company, applicable Constituent Documents of
Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable indemnification agreements, as the
case may be, shall (unless such determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction) be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee
and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.09_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not (and Purchaser shall
cause the Company not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any Claim, if such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination imposes any liability on
the Indemnitee that is not indemnified by Purchaser or the Company or any
continuing obligation on the Indemnitee.

(d) For a period of six years from the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be
maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Closing either

 



41  through the Companys existing insurance provider or another provider
reasonably selected by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the
Closing, Purchaser shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof
in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in
such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, the Company (at the cost and expense of Purchaser) may purchase
"tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount
that the Company would be permitted to spend during the sixyear period
provided for in this _Section 6.09(d)_, that provides coverage not materially
less favorable than the coverage described above.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of Purchaser and the Company under this _Section 6.09_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.09_ applies unless (A)
such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 6.09_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
6.09_).

(f) In the event that Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
and the Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this  _Section 6.09_.

6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser will cause the Company to, and the Company will, honor all
Company Employee Plans and other employment Contracts in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, subject to any
rights to amend or terminate such arrangements in accordance with such terms.
Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that the consummation of this Agreement
shall constitute a "change of control" for purposes of all Company Employee
Plans listed in _Section 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
_provided_ that the exclusion of a Company Employee Plan from the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be considered a determination that a "change
in control" has not occurred with respect to such Company Employee Plan.

 

(b) Purchaser will cause the Company to, and the Company will, for a period of
at least one year following the Closing, provide to each individual who
continues to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Closing (each, a " _Company Employee_ "): (i) at least the same base
salary, wages and cash bonus opportunity that were provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits
(including health and welfare, severance, vacation, paid time off and
retirement benefits) that are at least substantially comparable to those
benefits provided to employees of Purchaser having comparable base
compensation.

 



42 (c) For eligibility and vesting purposes (other than vesting of future equity
awards) and for purposes of determining severance amounts and future vacation
accruals under the compensation and employee benefit plans, policies or
arrangements of Purchaser and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Company
Employee, after the Closing, each Company Employee shall receive credit for
his or her service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Closing to
the same extent that such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing,
to credit for his or her service under any similar or comparable Company
Employee Plans (except to the extent this credit would result in a duplication
of accrual of benefits in respect of the same period of service). In addition,
if Company Employees or their dependents are included in any medical, dental,
health or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (each, a " _Successor Plan_ ") other than the plan
or plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing (each, a
" _Prior Plan_ "), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each Company Employee to be eligible to participate immediately, without any
waiting time, in any and all Successor Plans, and to cause the
Successor Plans to not include any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary
provisions with respect to pre-existing conditions, exclusions or any
actively-at-work requirements relating to such Company Employee and his or her
dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements were
applicable under any similar Prior Plan at the time of commencement of
participation in such Successor Plan), and any eligible expenses incurred by
any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Prior Plan ending on the date of such Company Employees
commencement of participation in the Successor Plan to be taken into account
under the Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if these amounts had been paid in accordance with the Successor
Plan.

 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i) recognize and provide all
earned but unused paid vacation and sick leave days of the Company Employees
as of the Closing Date and (ii) allow each of the Company Employees to use
such earned but unused vacation and sick leave days at such times as would
have been allowed under the Companys vacation and sick leave policies as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_, express or implied: (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Purchasers, the Companys
or any of their Affiliates ability to amend, modify or terminate any
particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) is intended
to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment or (iv) is intended
to confer upon any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

 



43 6.11 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Closing.

 

6.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser will, and
will cause MIFSA to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including
any "flex" provisions related thereto) on or prior to the Closing Date, and
will cause MIFSA to not, without the Companys prior written consent, agree to
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to an
amount that, together with the Purchasers and its Affiliates cash on hand
or available committed credit facilities, would be less than an amount that
would be required to fund the cash payments required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) adds new (or expands or adversely
changes any existing) conditions to obtaining the Financing unless such
amendment, modification or waiver results in conditions that are in the
aggregate substantially equivalent to the conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or waiver (or that are more favorable to the Purchaser and its
Affiliates) or (iii) would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or
prevent the Closing, (B) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) materially less likely to occur
or (C) materially adversely impact the ability of MIFSA or its Affiliates to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may cause MIFSA to amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Debt Fee Letter to (i) add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) implement or
exercise any "flex" provisions provided in the Debt Fee Letter as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. Purchaser will cause MIFSA to use its reasonable
best efforts to (I) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (II)
satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by MIFSA, obtain the waiver of, and cause
each of its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to the
Financing that are within Purchaser and its Affiliates control, (III)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or
consistent in all material respects with the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter (including any "flex" provisions contained therein) and (IV)
draw a sufficient amount of the Financing to enable Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, in the event that the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.02_ and the conditions to the availability of
the Financing have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date). Purchaser shall
cause the net proceeds from the Financing to be available to Purchaser on the
Closing Date. Upon the request of the Company or Seller, Purchaser will
keep Seller and the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of Purchasers efforts to obtain the Financing, including
providing Seller with prompt notice of (x) any repudiation, termination or
breach of the Debt Commitment Letter by any party thereto, of which Purchaser
becomes aware and (y) the occurrence of any other event or development that
would reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the Financing.

 



44 (b) The Company agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to, prior to the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, provide such assistance (and
to use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to provide such assistance) with the Financing as is
customary with Financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the senior notes offering contemplated thereby) and
reasonably requested by Purchaser, including: (a) participation in, and
assistance with, the marketing efforts related to the Financing, including
assisting Purchaser with Purchasers preparation of customary confidential
information memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering
memoranda and other customary marketing materials and information reasonably
deemed necessary by the Financing Sources to complete a successful syndication
for delivery to potential syndicate members and participants; (b)
participation by senior management, representatives and advisors of the
Company in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency
presentations and meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders and debt
investors (including, for the avoidance of doubt, direct contact with such
rating agencies and prospective lenders and debt investors), in each case, at
such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof; (c) delivery
to Purchaser and its Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable
of (i) the documentation and other information requested by the Financing
Sources with respect to (x) applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and (y) the
U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and the FCPA (and,
in any event, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to
the extent requested at least nine (9) days prior to the Closing Date), (ii)
the Financing Information relating to the Company and (iii) such other
financial information relating to the Company customary or reasonably
necessary for the completion of the Financing to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the preparation of customary
offering or information documents to be used for the Financing (which
financing information, for the avoidance of doubt, may be included in any
such offering or information documents used for or distributed in connection
with the Financing); (d) direct its independent auditors to cooperate with the
Financing consistent with their customary practice, including by providing
customary "comfort letters" (including customary "negative assurances") and
customary assistance with the due diligence activities of Purchaser and its
Affiliates and the Financing Sources, and customary consents to the inclusion
of audit reports in any relevant marketing materials, registration statements
and related government filings, in each case, in connection with any proposed
issuance and sale of securities; (e) assisting Purchaser with preparing pro
forma financial information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as part
of Purchasers preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma
financial statements for Purchaser and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis and other materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, offering or private placement memoranda, financial
projections for the Company as part of the consolidated business of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, and not on a stand-alone basis, and similar documents used
in connection with the Financing and assisting Purchaser in preparing
customary estimates and other forward looking financial information regarding
the future performance of the Company as a part of the consolidated business
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and not on a stand-alone basis, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, and providing customary
management representation letters 

 



45  to its accountants in relation to its accountants providing "comfort
letters" in connection with any securities offering made as part of the
Financing (" _Representation Letters_ "); (f) executing and delivering
definitive financing documents (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
authorization letters), including certificates (but not solvency
certificates), Representation Letters, and other documents, to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser; and (g) assisting Purchaser and its
Affiliates in causing the conditions precedent in the Debt Commitment Letter
to the Financing to be satisfied. If at any time Seller believes in good
faith that it has delivered to Purchaser all Financing Information and such
Financing Information is Compliant, it may deliver a written notice to
Purchaser to such effect, in which case the Financing Information shall be
deemed to have been delivered and to be Compliant as of the date of delivery
of such notice, unless Purchaser in good faith reasonably believes either any
Financing Information has not been received or is not Compliant and, within
five (5) consecutive Business Days after the date of Purchasers receipt of
the aforementioned notice, delivers a written notice to Seller to that effect
and stating with specificity what Financing Information it believes it has not
received or is not Compliant; provided, however, that (x) for the avoidance
of doubt, notwithstanding such five (5) consecutive Business Day period, if
Purchaser does not deliver any such written notice during such period, the
Financing Information shall be deemed to have been delivered, and to be
Compliant, as of the date of delivery of Sellers notice described above, and
such five (5) Business Day period shall not be deemed in any way to extend the
15 consecutive Business Day period specified in Section 2.01(ii)(A), and (y)
irrespective of the delivery of such a notice by Seller, the Company shall
continue to comply with its obligations under this _Section 6.12(b)_ in all
respects.

 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in
any other agreement between the Company and Purchaser (or its affiliates), the
Company agrees that the Purchaser and its affiliates may share customary
projections with respect to the Company as part of the consolidated business
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and not on a stand-alone basis, that the
Company assisted the Purchaser in preparing in accordance with _Section
6.12(b)_ with the Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter,
and that Purchaser, its affiliates and such Financing Sources may share such
information with potential Financing Sources in connection with any marketing
efforts in connection with the Financing, _provided_ that the recipients of
such information agree to customary confidentiality agreements.
Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section 6.12(b)_, (i) neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall be
required to enter into any letter, certificate, document, agreement or
instrument that will be effective prior to the Closing (other than
Representation Letters), (ii) nothing herein shall require cooperation
contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
nothing herein shall require the Company (A) to cause its legal counsel to
deliver any legal opinions or (B) to deliver any authorization letters or
any certificate as to solvency by Seller or the Company or its Subsidiaries,
and (iv) nothing herein shall require the Company to provide or deliver (1)
subject to _Section 6.15_, any audited or unaudited financial statements
not (x) delivered or provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof or (y)
otherwise constituting Financing Information, or (2) any financial information
with respect to a month or fiscal period that has not yet ended or that has
ended less than 45 days prior to the date of such request.

 



46 (d) Whether or not the Closing occurs, Purchaser will promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to any
costs associated with preparing its regular quarterly and annual financial
statements) in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by _Section 6.12(b)_. Purchaser will indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with
this  _Section 6.12_) and any assistance or activities in connection
therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of
this Agreement by any such Person.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
failure to obtain any Financing nor any failure to fund any Financing relieve
Purchaser of any obligation under or in respect of this Agreement, including
the obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby, and neither the obtaining nor the availability
or funding of any Financing shall constitute a condition to Purchasers
obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby. Purchaser reaffirms its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing, subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

 

6.13 _Termination of Related Party Agreements; Transfer of Company Assets_.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Seller and Purchaser, Company shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary so that, at or
prior to the Closing, each Contract between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and a Company Related Person listed in _Section 6.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated without further liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with _Section 6.13_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Seller shall cause all insurance
policies listed on _Section 4.06_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and
_Section 3.20_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter to be transferred to the
Company or otherwise cause the Company to enter into replacement policies on
substantially the same terms prior to the Closing without imposing
liabilities on the Company in connection with such transfer or replacement
(other than liabilities paid prior to the Closing or reflected in Net Working
Capital). If Seller or the Company discovers after the date hereof that it
holds any property (other than Contracts, the Purchased Shares, its books and
records, cash, cash equivalents (including time deposits) or marketable
securities) or is a party to any Contracts used in the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Contracts
with equity holders of Seller relating to their equity interests in Seller to
which none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party), Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser thereof and shall, if Purchaser requests, transfer
such property and Contracts to the Company prior to the Closing for no
consideration.

 



47 6.14 _Tax Matters_. Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall cooperate with
each other in connection with (i) the preparation and filing of any U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Returns that include the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) any audit or
examination by any Taxing Authority of the Tax Returns referred to in clause
(i). Such cooperation shall include the furnishing or making available of
employees on a mutually convenient basis and records, books of account or
other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary or helpful for
the defense against assertions of any Taxing Authority as to any Tax Returns
referred to in clause (i) above.

 

6.15 _Audited 2014 Financial Statements_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, which comprise the balance sheet as of December
31, 2014 and the audited consolidated statement of operations, changes in
stockholders deficit, comprehensive income and cash flows of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the notes thereto
(the " _Audited 2014 Financial Statements_ ").

 

6.16 _Section 280G Matters_. If requested, no less than fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date by Purchaser in good faith, based upon
calculations prepared in good faith by the Companys advisors (which
calculations shall be provided to Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement), the Company shall (a) use its
reasonable best efforts (provided that doing so will not require any payment
to any "disqualified individual") to obtain from each "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) who could otherwise receive payments and/or benefits
that would separately or in the aggregate constitute "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code on account
of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement (" _Parachute Payments_ "),
a written waiver that shall provide that, if the requisite stockholder
approval under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder is not obtained, no Parachute Payments with respect to such
disqualified individual, in the absence of such stockholder approval, shall be
payable to or retained by such disqualified individual to the extent that such
Parachute Payments would not be deductible by reason of the application of
Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition of the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code on such disqualified individual; and (b) submit
to the stockholders of the Company for approval, in a manner and form that
complies with the stockholder approval procedures set forth in Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder any payments and/or
benefits that may separately or in the aggregate constitute Parachute
Payments in the absence of such stockholder approval. All materials produced
by the Company in connection with the implementation of this _Section 6.16_
shall be provided to Purchaser in advance for Purchasers review and comment,
and the Company shall consider any of Purchasers requested changes or
comments in good faith and not unreasonably omit them. The parties acknowledge
that this _Section 6.16_ shall not apply to any Purchaser Agreements that
are not provided to the Company at least ten (10) days prior to Closing so
that, for the avoidance of doubt, compliance with this _Section 6.16_ shall
be determined as if such Purchaser Agreements had not been entered into. The
Purchaser acknowledges that the Company cannot compel any "disqualified
individual" to waive any existing rights under a contract or agreement with
the Company or any Subsidiary and, provided that the Company has used
its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers from such "disqualified
individuals" pursuant to _Section 6.16(a)_, the Company shall not be deemed
in breach of this _Section 6.16_ if any such disqualified person refuses
to waive any such right.

8.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser; or

 

(b) by either of Seller or Purchaser:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before July 6, 2015
(such date being the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall
not be available to a party if the failure of the Closing to have been
consummated on or before the End Date was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final,
non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations
under _Section 6.04_); or

 

(c) by Purchaser, if the Company or Seller shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or
_7.02(b)_ and (B) cannot be cured by the Company or Seller, as applicable, by
the End Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
30 days following receipt of written notice from Purchaser stating Purchasers
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.01(c)_
and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ if
it is then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement hereunder such that Seller has the right to terminate under _Section
8.01(d)_; or

(d) by Seller, if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 7.03(a)_ or _7.03(b)_ and
(B) cannot be cured by Purchaser by the End Date or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt of written
notice from Seller stating Sellers intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)_ and the basis for such termination;
_provided_ that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)_ if it or the Company is then in breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder such that
Purchaser has the right to terminate under _Section 8.01(c)_.

 

8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.01_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties,

 



51  specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than _Section
6.12(d)_, this  _Section 8.02_ and _Article IX_ (other than _Section
9.11_), all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there
shall be no liability on the part of Purchaser, Seller, the Company or their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of any willful and material breach of this Agreement.
For purposes of this  _Section 8.02_, "willful and material breach" means an
intentional and willful material breach, or an intentional and willful
material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or
omission by a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
failure to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that Purchaser shall not be
permitted to claim that a failure to close the transactions contemplated
hereby due to Purchasers inability to obtain the Financing or other funding
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in circumstances
in which all of the closing conditions set forth in  _Section 7.01_ and
_Section 7.02_ have been satisfied or waived is not a willful and material
breach by Purchaser of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IX

of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "

Subsidiaries assets) are

 



52  specifically disclaimed by Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries and all
other Persons (including the Representatives of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) and (c) Purchaser and its Affiliates are not relying on any
representations and warranties in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except the Company Representations and the

Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser has received certain projections,
including projected statements of operating revenues and income from
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan
information. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties and that
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the

not relied on any such estimates, projections or other forecasts or plans.
Purchaser further agrees that from and after the Closing, (i) none of Seller,
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability to Purchaser, the Company or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Purchaser, or Purchasers use of, any such estimates,
projections or forecasts or any other information, document or material
provided to or made available to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
Purchaser has not relied on any such estimates, projections or forecasts or
any other such information, document or material. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall prejudice or limit any claim (i)
by Purchaser for fraud with respect to the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ , _Article IV_ or the certificates delivered
pursuant to _Section 7.02(d)_ or (ii) by Purchaser or Seller for fraud with
respect to the estimation or determination of the Cash Amount, the

Amount pursuant to _Sections 1.02_ and _2.04_.

 

9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,

applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained herein or,

Company, Purchaser or Seller in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

 

9.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or

9.08_ and _Section 9.04_, _Section 9.09(d)_, _Section 9.10_ and _Section

of this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The foregoing sentence
is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual
discharge and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, and shall continue to
apply following the Closing in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations that
survive the Closing. This guarantee shall be a primary obligation of the
Parent and accordingly Seller shall not be obliged before enforcing this
guarantee to take any action in any court or arbitral proceedings against
Purchaser, to make any claim against or any demand of Purchaser, or to
exercise, levy or enforce any distress, diligence or other process of
execution against the Purchaser. The guarantee is a continuing guarantee
that shall remain valid and in full force and effect until Purchaser no
longer has any Guaranteed Obligations under this Agreement and shall survive
the termination of this Agreement in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations
that survive the termination of this Agreement. The liability of the Parent
shall not be affected or released by any neglect or forbearance in enforcing
the obligations of Purchaser or by any amendment or variation of Purchasers
obligations or by any other act, omission, matter or thing whatsoever whereby
the Parent as security only would or might have been affected or released (for
the avoidance of doubt, subject in each case to the provisions of this
Agreement governing the survival of Purchasers obligations). The Parent
hereby represents and warrants to the Company that (i) it is a public limited
company, validly existing under the laws of Ireland, and it has all power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this _Section
9.21_; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it
has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate
action, and no other proceedings or actions 

 



74  on the part of it are necessary therefor; (iii) this Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by it and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the Company and Seller, constitutes a valid
and legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws,
other similar Laws affecting creditors rights and general principles of
equity affecting the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies and (iv) the execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this
Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
subject to obtaining any required Governmental Approvals referred to in
_Section 3.17_, _Section 4.03_ and _Section 5.04_: (a) violate any
provision of Law to which Parent is subject, (b) violate any Order that is
applicable to Parent or (c) conflict with or result in a breach of the
provisions of or the creation of any Encumbrance under, or constitute
a default or create a right of acceleration, termination or amendment under,
(A) the Constituent Documents of Parent or (B) any Contract to which Parent is
a party, in each case except for Impacts which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under this _Section 9.21_ in
a timely manner.
