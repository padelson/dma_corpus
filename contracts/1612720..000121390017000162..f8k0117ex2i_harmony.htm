Mundo Warrants into which the Harmony Warrants are convertible according to
this Section 1.5(b)(ii).

  



  

(iii) Each share of Class A common stock of Merger Sub (other than any
such share held by Harmony) will be cancelled and converted (subject to

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(x) All of the Mundo Shares and Mundo Warrants issued to the holders
of Harmony Common Stock, Harmony Warrants and Merger Sub Shares and all of
the Mundo Options granted in exchange of the Company Options upon consummation
of the Amalgamation shall be deemed to have been issued or granted in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the outstanding Harmony Common Stock,
Harmony Warrants, Merger Sub Shares and Company Options that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of Mundo of such shares of Harmony
Common Stock, Harmony Warrants or Merger Sub Shares.

  



  

(xi) Immediately following the Amalgamation, the exercise price under
the Mundo Options shall be $4.16 per Mundo Share. If the directors of Mundo
determine in good faith that the excess of (c) the aggregate fair market value
of the shares subject to the Mundo Option immediately after the amalgamation
over (d) the aggregate exercise price pursuant to the Mundo Option (such
excess referred to as the " _Post-Amalgamation Option Value_ ") would
otherwise exceed the excess of (c) the aggregate fair market value of the
Company Option immediately before the amalgamation over (d) the aggregate
exercise price pursuant to the Company Option (such excess referred to as the
" _Pre- Amalgamation Option Value_ "), the exercise price per Mundo
Option shall be modified, but only to the extent necessary and in a manner
that does not otherwise adversely affect the holder, such that the Post-
Amalgamation Option Value does not exceed the Pre-Amalgamation Option Value
for purposes of subsection 7(1.4) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada). The Mundo
Options shall otherwise be governed by the terms of the Company Options.

  



  

(xii) If for any reason, including the Redomestication of Harmony,
Harmony or the Company determines in good faith that the
Transactions, including the Amalgamation, cannot be completed as contemplated
herein, then the Transactions shall be completed by way of plan of
arrangement or other mutually agreeable form, on terms that give rise to
substantively identical (to the extent commercially feasible) results as
contemplated herein.

  



  

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Mundo Share will be
issued by virtue of the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and any fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
share.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of Mundo Shares
that the holders of shares of Harmony Common Stock and Merger Sub Shares and
holders of Company Options are entitled to receive as a result of the
Transactions shall be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Harmony Common Stock
or Merger Sub Shares), cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Harmony Common Stock or Merger Sub Shares occurring on or
after the date hereof but not after the delivery of such Harmony Certificates
or Merger Sub Shares pursuant to Section 1.6 below.

1.6.   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Harmony shall appoint Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ ") to act as exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging the Mundo Shares,
Mundo Warrants and cash consideration for the Harmony Certificates and the
Merger Sub Shares.. Upon surrender of the Harmony Certificates and any
Uncertificated Shares and delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal,
in each case to the Exchange Agent, the holders of such Harmony Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares shall receive in exchange therefor certificates
representing the Mundo Shares or Mundo Warrants, as applicable (" _Mundo
Certificates_ ") into which their shares of Harmony Common Stock, Harmony
Warrants and Merger Sub Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time and
the Harmony Certificates and Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Mundo shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as
necessary, the Mundo Certificates to be paid in respect of the Harmony
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares surrendered. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Harmony Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Sections
1.5(a) and 1.5(b).

  



  

(b) If Mundo Certificates are to be issued in a name other than that
in which the Harmony Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Harmony Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered
will be properly endorsed (in the case of the Harmony Certificates) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, accompanied by an instrument of
transfer that is reasonably satisfactory to Mundo and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Mundo, or any agent designated by
it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
Mundo Certificates in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Harmony Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered, or established
to the satisfaction of Mundo or any agent designated by it that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

  



  

1.7. _No Distributions Until Surrender of Certificates_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Mundo Shares with a record date after the Closing
Date will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Harmony Certificates
with respect to the Mundo Shares to be issued upon surrender thereof until the
holders of record of such Harmony Certificates shall surrender such Harmony
Certificates. Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Harmony Certificates with a properly completed letter of transmittal, Mundo
shall promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the
Mundo Certificates representing Mundo Shares issued in exchange therefor and
the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Closing Date theretofore paid with respect to such Mundo Shares.

  



  

   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.8. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Harmony Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Mundo shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Harmony Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Mundo
Certificates that the shares of Harmony Common Stock and Harmony Warrants
formerly represented by such Harmony Certificates were converted into and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7; provided,
however, that as a condition precedent to the issuance of such Mundo
Certificates and other distributions, the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Harmony Certificates shall indemnify Mundo against any claim that
may be made against Mundo with respect to the Harmony Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.9. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Mundo with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Harmony and Merger Sub, respectively, the then current officers
and directors of Mundo, Harmony and Merger Sub and the officers and directors
of the Company shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

  



  

1.10. _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnification obligations
set forth in Article VII of this Agreement and for any reimbursable expenses
incurred as provided for in Section 1.13(e) below, 7.5% of the Mundo Shares to
be issued to the Shareholders pursuant to the Transactions at Closing (other
than the Contingent Shares) (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") shall be deposited in
escrow (the " _Escrow Account_ "), which shall be allocated among the
Shareholders in the same proportion as their ownership of Mundo Shares, all
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement to be
entered into at the Closing between Mundo, the Representative (as defined
below), and Continental, as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ "), substantially
in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). On the earlier
of (i) the closing of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar
transaction or series of transactions which require approval of
the shareholders of Mundo or (ii) the second anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Escrow Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release the
number of Escrow Shares, less any of such shares applied in satisfaction of a
claim for indemnification pursuant to Article VII and any of such shares
related to a claim that is then unresolved, in the same proportions as
originally deposited into escrow. Any Escrow Shares held with respect to any
unresolved claim for indemnification and not applied as indemnification with
respect to such claim upon its resolution shall be delivered to such Persons
promptly upon such resolution.

  



  

1.11.   _Committee and Representative for Purposes of Escrow Agreement_.

  



  

(a) _Harmony Committee_. Prior to the Closing, the Board of
Directors of Harmony shall appoint a committee consisting of one or more of
its then members to act on behalf of Harmony to take all necessary actions and
make all decisions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as defined below) and
this Agreement. In the event of a vacancy in such committee, the board of
directors of Harmony or, after the consummation of the Amalgamation, a
majority of those Persons who served on Harmony's Board immediately prior to
the Closing Date, shall appoint as a successor some other Person who would
qualify as an "independent" director of Harmony and who has not had any
relationship with the Company prior to the Closing. Such committee is intended
to be the " _Committee_ " referred to in the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Representative_. The Company hereby designates Jason Theofilos,
or his designee, (the " _Representative_ ") to represent the interests of the
Persons entitled to receive the consideration as a result of the Amalgamation
for purposes of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, giving consents and
approvals hereunder and making those determinations hereunder that are
specifically reserved to the Representative by the terms hereof. If such
Person ceases to serve in such capacity, for any reason, those members of the
board of directors of Mundo who were members of the board of directors of the
Company prior to the Closing shall appoint as successor a Person who was a
former director of the Company or such other Person as such members
shall designate. Such Person or successor is intended to be the
"Representative" referred to in the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

  



  

1.12.   _Shareholder Matters_.

  



  

(a) By its execution of this Agreement, each Shareholder, in its
capacity as a security holder of the Company, hereby approves this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and authorizes the Company and its
directors and officers and, upon becoming a shareholder of Merger Sub and
Mundo, each of those companies and their respective directors and officers to

other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and its exhibits. Such execution and approval shall be
irrevocable by each Shareholder.

  



  

(b) Each Shareholder has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. With respect to any
Shareholder that is not an individual, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by each Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Pre-Amalgamation Exchange) have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Shareholder
and no other proceedings on the part of such Shareholder is necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to Applicable Law and the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each Shareholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery thereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal and
binding obligation of each Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholders
in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  



  

(c) Each Shareholder for itself only, represents and warrants as
follows:

  



  

(i) that its execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any

securities laws _( "Blue Sky Laws_"), the applicable securities laws in each
of the provinces and territories of Canada, as amended ("
_Canadian Securities Laws_ ") and the rules and regulations thereunder, and
(3) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or

Contingent Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, Net Income for the fiscal
year of Mundo ending December 31, 2017 shall include Net Income for the
entire twelve (12) months of 2017 for Mundo notwithstanding when the Closing
Date occurs within 2017; and

  



  

(ii) If, for the fiscal year of Mundo ending December 31, 2018,
either (y) Mundo has Net Income equal to or greater than $21,500,000 or (z)
during such year, the closing price of Mundo Shares equals or exceeds $15.00
per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For greater certainty, if the criteria in (i) above is not
satisfied in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, but Mundo
has aggregate Net Income of $36,750,000 for the two fiscal years ending
December 31, 2018 combined, then the total Contingent Shares shall become
fully earned and due to the Shareholders. If the criteria in (i) and (ii)
above are not satisfied, the Contingent Shares shall be cancelled for nil
consideration. The Contingent Shares shall not be subject to any offset or
claw-back of any nature whatsoever

  



  

(c) As used herein, " _Net Income_ " means net income of Mundo as
set forth in Mundo's audited financial statements for any applicable year, as
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP (as hereafter defined), including any
net income attributable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following
the Closing Date, with the following adjustments made on an after-tax
basis: plus any and all expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
(including but not limited to legal, accounting, broker, escrow, Exchange
Agent, and exchange listing fees, but excluding any expenses related to "tail"
insurance policies acquired pursuant to Section 5.14(b) hereto)
(collectively, the " _Transactions Expenses_ "); plus expenses incurred in
connection with the Mundo Plan (as defined in Section 5.1) or any other non-
cash option expenses of Mundo; plus expenses of any acquisitions of
businesses after the date of this Agreement ; plus amortization of acquisition
related intangible assets (including all acquisitions prior to, as of, and
after the Closing hereof); plus public company costs of Mundo as determined by
the Mundo board of directors in excess of $1,000,000; less any gains from
reversals of contingent liabilities; and less any results attributable to
businesses acquired after the date of this Agreement (such results to be
determined by the Mundo board of directors and shall not include synergies
related to any such acquisitions).

  



  

(d) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, any Contingent Shares
to be delivered pursuant to this Section 1.13 shall be (i) released from
escrow automatically and without requiring approval from the Mundo Board other
than approvals granted in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) allocated among the Shareholders as set forth on _Schedule
1.13(d)_ , and (iii) automatically equitably adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Mundo Shares), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Mundo Shares occurring on or after the date hereof.

(e) Not later than 120 days after the fiscal year with respect to
which Net Income is calculated, Mundo shall deliver to the Committee and
Representative its Net Income calculation (the " _Net Income Calculation_ "),
which shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties unless the Committee,
within ten Business Days after its receipt of the Net Income Calculation,
notifies Mundo in writing that it disputes any of the amounts set forth
therein, specifying the nature of the dispute and the basis therefore. The
parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and, if the parties
so resolve all disputes, the Net Income Calculation, as amended to the extent
necessary to reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties. If the parties do not reach agreement in resolving
the dispute within ten Business Days after notice is given to Mundo by the
Committee, the parties shall submit the dispute to PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLP or if PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP is unavailable another
independent accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to the parties (the "
_Accounting Arbiter_ "). Within thirty 30 days of such submission, the
Accounting Arbiter shall determine (it being understood that in making such
determination, the Accounting Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert and
not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Mundo setting
forth its Net Income Calculation (the " _Mundo Calculation_ ") and the
Committee setting forth its Net Income Calculation (the " _Committee
Calculation_ "), and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
and shall render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the
resulting Net Income Calculation which shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbiter (x) shall be
bound by the provisions of this Section 1.13(f) and (y) must choose between
the Mundo Calculation and the Committee Calculation and may not determine that
Net Income is any other amount. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Arbiter shall be borne by Mundo. The Committee shall be entitled to
engage a firm of independent accountants to advise it with respect to the Net
Income Calculation, with the reasonable fees and expenses of such firm to be
paid by Mundo. In the event that the Mundo Calculation is determined by the
Accounting Arbiter to be correct, the Escrow Agreement will provide that the
Escrow Agent shall release a number of Escrow Shares (valued at $10.20 per
share) to Mundo equal to the fees, costs and expenses incurred by Mundo in
connection with the determination of the Net Income Calculation provided for
in this Section 1.13(e).

  



  

(f) Contingent Shares shall be delivered to the Persons entitled to
them no later than five (5) days after the Net Income Calculation becomes
conclusive and binding for the fiscal years with respect to such Contingent
Shares are earned.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything set forth above, upon the closing of a
liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction or series of
transactions which requires the approval of the shareholders of Mundo and at a
valuation of Mundo or its assets that is equivalent to a per share purchase
price in excess of $10.20 per share, the total Contingent Shares shall become
fully earned and due to the Shareholders and shall be delivered as set forth
in this Section 1.13.

  



  

1.14. _Sale Restriction_. Prior to the Effective Time, each holder of
Company Common Shares and Company Options shall enter into a Lock-Up
Agreement in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Lock-Up Agreement_ "). The Mundo
Certificates evidencing Mundo Shares issued to holders of Company Common
Shares and Company Options as a result of the Transactions shall each include
prominent disclosure or bear a prominent legend evidencing the fact that such
shares are subject to such Lock-Up Agreements.

" _Plan,_ " and, collectively, the " _Plans_ "). All Plans have been
maintained and administered in all material respects in compliance with
their respective terms and with the requirements prescribed by any applicable

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 2.11(b)_ hereto, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any Plan or
otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits.

  



  

(c) No material liability under Title IV of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") has been incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been satisfied in full and
no event has occurred and, to the Company's knowledge, no condition exists
that could reasonably be likely to result in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA. No Plan
is a defined benefit pension plan or is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Plan is a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare arrangement

labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Company's knowledge, are there any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees. There are no
pending grievance or similar proceedings involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, to the Company's knowledge, any of its employees who are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract,
and there are no continuing obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the resolution of any such proceeding that is no longer pending.

written agreements between the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
employees or individual contractors that their employment or services will be
for any particular length that cannot be terminated at any time, subject to
any applicable notice period prescribed therein. To the Company's
knowledge, none of its officers or key employees currently intends to
terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects and, to the Company's knowledge, each of the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' employees and individual contractors is in compliance in all
material respects, with the terms of the respective employment and service
agreements between the Company or its Subsidiaries and such individuals,

(a) Effective at and after the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article VII (including without limitation the limitations
set forth in Section 7.4), Mundo and its representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (the "Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified, defended
and held harmless by the Shareholders, but only to the extent of the Escrow
Shares, from and against all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed
upon, or incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of, arising out of or
resulting from the causes enumerated in clauses (i) or (ii) below and not from
a Harmony Breach:

  



  

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, including any
Schedule or ancillary agreement hereto, or contained in any certificate
delivered by the Company to Harmony pursuant to this Agreement with respect
hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing; and

will Losses include any indirect, remote, exemplary, consequential, punitive
or multiple-based losses, loss of profits, liabilities, damages, judgments,
awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs or expenses.

  



  

7.2. _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The indemnification
obligations and liabilities under this _Article VII _with respect to
actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims
brought against Harmony or Mundo by a Person other than the Shareholders or
Option Holders (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

  



  

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The Indemnified Parties will give the party
allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this Article
VII (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") prompt written notice after receiving
written notice of any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability,
obligation or facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a "Notice
of Claim") which Notice of Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief
description of the nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the underlying
representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached and the
facts then known on which such alleged breach is based, (iii) the total

Loss which may be covered under such insurance, and the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at its
expense.

  



  

   

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Defense_. The Indemnifying Parties shall have the right, at
their option (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c)
below) and at their own expense, by written notice to the Indemnified Parties
(the " _Notice to Defend_ "), to assume the entire control of, subject to the
right of the Indemnified Parties to participate (at their expense and with
counsel of their choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the
Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall
be entitled to appoint a counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided that an Indemnifying Party's assumption of the defense
of a Third Party Claim will not, vis-a-vis the Indemnified Parties,
constitute acceptance of liability to the Indemnified Parties under this
Article VII. If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Parties shall diligently and in good faith
defend such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified
Parties reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided, however,
that in the case of any settlement providing for remedies which are not
merely incidental to a primary damage claim or claims for monetary damages,
the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to approve any settlement, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate fully in all respects
with the Indemnifying Parties in any such defense, compromise or settlement
thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the
Indemnified Parties shall make available to the Indemnifying Parties all
pertinent information and documents under its control.

  



  

(c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties if the Third Party Claim is a criminal proceeding, action or
indictment.

  



  

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or
to provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any
Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Parties against the Indemnifying Parties
and shall not affect the Indemnifying Parties' duties or obligations under
this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such
failure shall have (i) adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying
Parties to defend against or reduce their liability or (ii) caused or
increased such liability or otherwise caused the Losses for which the
Indemnifying Parties are obligated to be greater than such Losses would have
been had the Indemnified Parties given the Indemnifying Parties prompt notice
hereunder. So long as the Indemnifying Parties are defending any such
action actively and in good faith, the Indemnified Parties shall not settle
such action. The Indemnified Parties shall make available to the Indemnifying
Parties all relevant records and other relevant materials required by them and
in the possession or under the control of the Indemnified Parties, for the
use of the Indemnifying Parties and their representatives in defending any
such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable cooperation in such
defense.

  



  

   

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Indemnifying Parties, promptly after
making a Notice to Defend, fail to defend such Third Party Claim in good
faith, the Indemnified Parties, at its own cost and expense, will (upon
further written notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
or settlement of such Third Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable
discretion, provided that the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
approve any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) _Indemnified Parties ' Rights_. Anything in this Section 7.2 to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Parties (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any
action or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include a full
and unconditional release from all liability and obligation in respect of
such action without any payment by the Indemnified Parties.

  



  

7.3. _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by
insurance paid for by Harmony or Mundo prior to or after the Closing, Harmony
and Mundo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum
recovery under such insurance. The existence of a claim by the Indemnified
Parties for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any
Loss shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the
indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be
due and owing by the Indemnifying Parties. If Harmony or Mundo has received
the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Parties in
respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other
amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other
amounts in trust for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties and shall pay to
the Indemnifying Parties, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum
equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the
aggregate amount of any payments received from the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that no
insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would
not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification
provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for
which it is obligated.

  



  

7.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article VII or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
following terms will apply to any claim arising out of this Agreement or
related to the transactions contemplated hereby:

  



  

(a) _Survival: Time Limitation_. The covenants and agreements of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement which were required to be
performed on or prior to the Closing, and the representations and warranties
of the Parties under this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, at which
time such representations and warranties will expire (the " _Survival Period_
"). The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement, any ancillary agreement hereto or in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith which
were required to be performed prior to the Closing shall not survive the
Closing and those which are required to be performed after the Closing shall
survive the Closing until performed for the shorter period
explicitly specified therein. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, no
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
shall survive after the release of the Escrow Shares by the Escrow Agent.

  



  

   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any indemnification claim made by the Indemnified Parties prior
to the termination of the Survival Period shall be preserved despite the
subsequent termination of such Survival Period and any claim set forth in a
Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Survival Period shall
survive until final resolution thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, no claim for indemnification under this Article VII shall
be brought after the end of the Survival Period.

  



  

(c) _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII
unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise
payable exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the amount
payable shall be only the Losses that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section
7.1 in excess of the amount of the Deductible (including, for avoidance of
doubt and subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, all Losses
that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.1 from time to time after the
Deductible has been exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible
shall not apply to Losses that arise out of a breach of the representations
and warranties in Section 2.3, which shall be indemnifiable as to all
Losses that so arise from the first dollar thereof.

  



  

(d) _Aggregate Amount Limitations_. The aggregate liability for
Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the securities
and cash held in the Escrow Account, and no Person shall have any claim
against the Shareholders and Optionholders other than for any of such
securities or cash held in the Escrow Account.

  



  

(e) _No Double Recovery_. In the event that any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII are recoverable under more
than one provision of this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties will only be
permitted to recover with respect to any particular Losses suffered by it one
time as it is the parties' intention that once any particular Losses have
been recovered by the Indemnified Parties under one provision, such Losses no
longer exist and, therefore, recovery by the Indemnified Parties for such
same Losses under another provision would constitute an unintended and
prohibited "double" recovery.

  



  

(f) _Miscellaneous Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, the Indemnified Parties
will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1 for any Loss
underlying such indemnification claim to the extent that: (i) the Indemnified
Parties could have, with commercially reasonable efforts, mitigated or
prevented such Loss (or any part thereof); (ii) such Loss (or any part
thereof) results from or is increased by the action or inaction of any
Indemnified Parties or any Affiliate thereof; or (iii) such Loss (or any part
thereof) arises, or is increased, as a result of a change after the Closing
in any accounting principle, method or policy.

  



  

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.5. _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
HEREIN OR OTHERWISE, EACH OF HARMONY AND MERGER SUB (WHICH PURSUANT TO THE
AMALGAMATION SHALL BECOME MUNDO), ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE OTHER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, FROM AND AFTER THE
CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WITH RESPECT
TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE PURSUANT AND SUBJECT TO THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE VII.
ACCORDINGLY, EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES
ANY REMEDY, LIABILITY AND ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE PURSUANT TO LAW OR EQUITY
OTHER THAN THE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED UNDER THIS ARTICLE VII.
FURTHERMORE, EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY COVENANTS NOT TO SUE OR OTHERWISE THREATEN
ANY CLAIM THAT INCLUDES ANY REMEDY WAIVED BY THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, AND SUCH
PARTIES AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE,
THE AGREEMENT, WAIVERS AND RELEASES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 7.5 ARE
CONSPICUOUS.

  



  

7.6. _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the
value of the consideration issued by Mundo as a result of the Transactions,
except as otherwise required by Law.

  



  

7.7. _Committee; Application of Escrow Account_. The parties
acknowledge that the Committee's obligations under this Article VII are
solely as a representative of Harmony and Mundo in the manner set forth in the
Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify Harmony and
Mundo under this Article VII and that the Committee shall have no personal
responsibility for any expenses incurred by them in such capacity and that
all payments to Mundo as a result of such indemnification obligations shall
be made solely from, and to the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket
expenses of the Committee for attorneys' fees and other costs shall be borne
in the first instance by Mundo, which may make a claim for reimbursement
thereof against the consideration held in the Escrow Account upon the claim
with respect to which such expenses are incurred becoming an

have been consummated by March 27, 2017, or such later date or dates as shall
be set forth in an amendment or amendments to Article 6(E) of Harmony's
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of
extending the date by which Harmony is required to have completed a business

for the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Harmony Common Stock to
obtain the Harmony Extensions, which proxy statements shall include the
recommendation of its board of directors that holders of Harmony Common Stock
vote in favor of the Harmony Extensions, or (ii) any party whose action or

act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  



  

   

 | 60| 
---|---|---

action is final and nonappealable;

  



  

(d) by the Company, upon a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Harmony set forth in this

untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Article VI would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
breach by Harmony is curable by Harmony prior to the Closing Date, then the
Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) for
fifteen (15) days after delivery of written notice from the Company to
Harmony of such breach (or if the Termination Date is less than fifteen (15)
days from notice by the Company, is not cured, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured, by the Company by the Termination Date), provided Harmony
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement

Agreement or if such breach by Harmony is cured during such fifteen (15)-day
period);

  



  

(e) by Harmony, upon a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have
become untrue, in either case only such that the conditions set forth in
Article VI would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that
if such breach is curable by the Company prior to the Closing Date,
then Harmony may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) for
fifteen (15) days after delivery of written notice from Harmony to the
Company of such breach (or if the Termination Date is less than fifteen (15)
days from notice by Harmony, is not cured, or by its nature or timing cannot
be cured, by Harmony by the Termination Date), provided the Company
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that Harmony may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if
such breach by the Company is cured during such fifteen (15)-day period);

  



  

(f) by the Company, if immediately prior to the Amalgamation,
Harmony does not have cash on hand of $57,000,000 after payment of
all amounts payable under Section 5.18 (other than payment of up to
$5,000,000 to investment bankers);

vote of the holders of shares of Harmony Common Stock required under
Harmony's Charter Documents;

  



  

   

 | 61| 
---|---|---

cash in accordance with Harmony's Charter Documents;

Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and the Transactions shall
be abandoned with no party hereto or their Affiliates having any recourse at
law or equity with respect to the Transactions, their negotiation, or any
matters related thereto in any way; provided, however, that Section 5.9
hereof will survive by its terms and the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
restored to full force and effect and shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms.

  



  

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. The Transactions Expenses and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement (including the

10.3.   _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement and each
other document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same document and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by email or facsimile to
counsel for the other party of a counterpart executed by a party shall be
deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

  



  

10.4.   _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the letter of intent between
Harmony and the Company dated November 4, 2016 is hereby terminated in its
entirety and shall be of no further force and effect (except to the extent
expressly stated to survive the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder
(except as specifically provided in this Agreement).

  



  

10.5.   _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

10.6.   _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement.

  



  

10.7.   _Governing Law_. In connection with Section 5-1401 of the
General Obligations Law of the State of New York, this Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York without regard to principles of conflicts of law that would result in
the application of the substantive law of another jurisdiction.

  



  

10.8.   _Venue; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that
any action, proceeding or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this
Agreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration in
accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). The arbitration shall be brought
before the AAA International Center for Dispute Resolution's offices in New
York City, New York, will be conducted in English and will be decided by a
panel of three arbitrators selected from the AAA Commercial Disputes Panel and
that the arbitrator panel's decision shall be final and enforceable by any
court having jurisdiction over the party from whom enforcement is sought. The
cost of such arbitrators and arbitration services, together with the
prevailing party's legal fees and expenses, shall be borne by the non-
prevailing party or as otherwise directed by the arbitrators.

10.9. _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

10.10.   _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section
10.10, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

10.11.   _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time prior to the Closing Date by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. After the Closing Date, this
Agreement may be amended only with the consent of the Representative.

  



  

10.12.   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

  



  

10.13.   _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement
shall mean United States dollars.
