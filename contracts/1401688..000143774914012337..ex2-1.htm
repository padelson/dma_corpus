("Parent"), Vigor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"), and Vitacost.com, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Acquisition Sub shall commence a tender offer
(the " **Offer** ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares (the "Company
Shares") of Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock"), at a price of $8.00 per Company Share, net to the
holder thereof in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per Company Share
that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Offer Price"), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, it is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and each Company Share that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Cancelled Company Shares,
Dissenting Company Shares and Non-Cancelled Company Shares) will thereupon be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price, and the Company will survive the Merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) determined that it is in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained herein and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if required by
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub have (i)
declared the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best
interest of Parent and Acquisition Sub, respectively, and (ii) approved the
execution by Parent and Acquisition Sub, respectively, of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into
this Agreement, that certain stockholders and their Affiliates, collectively
(the "Major Stockholders") enter into a Tender and Support Agreement, dated as
of the date hereof (the "Support Agreement"), simultaneously herewith,
pursuant to which, among other things, the Major Stockholders have agreed to
vote to tender their Company Shares and take certain other actions in
furtherance of the Merger, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in the Support Agreement; and

 



 

 



   



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to prescribe certain
conditions with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the

THE OFFER

 



 

2.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated pursuant to _Article IX_, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than fifteen (15)
Business Days thereafter), Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the Company
Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to the terms of _Section
2.1(c)_, equal to the Offer Price. The Offer shall be made by means of an
offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that is disseminated to all of the
Company Stockholders and contains the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in _Annex A_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer shall be subject only to:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that, prior to the expiration
of the Offer, there be validly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with
the terms of the Offer a number of Company Shares that, together with the
Company Shares then owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub (if any), represents
at least a majority of all then outstanding Company Shares on a fully diluted
basis (not including Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures); and

 



 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_.

 



 

(b) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company in its sole discretion, Acquisition Sub may not (and Parent
shall not permit Acquisition Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, the
condition set forth in clause (A) of _Annex A_ or the condition set forth in
clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ , and (ii) make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid
in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer Price or the number of Company Shares
sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a manner required by
the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other
than those set forth in _Annex A_, (E) modifies the conditions set forth in
_Annex A_, or (F) amends any other term or condition of the Offer in any
manner that is material and adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

 



 

(c) _Adjustments to the Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Sub's
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Shares that are tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 



 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date that
is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at
the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(i)_ or anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 



 

(A) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any
Law or Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or Nasdaq, in any such case which is applicable to the Offer; and

 



 

(B) in the event that all of the conditions to the Offer, including the
Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions set forth on _Annex A_, are
not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for successive
extension periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or any longer period
as may be approved in advance by the Company) in order to permit the
satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that
the foregoing clauses (A) or (B) of this _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article IX.

 



 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer in any
manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the
Offer prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which
case Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to)
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event
more than one Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company
Shares that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ ). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on
a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that
Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer,
_provided, however,_ that without the prior written consent of the Company,
Acquisition Sub shall not accept for payment or pay for any Company Shares if,
as a result, Acquisition Sub would acquire less than the number of Company
Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to
reduction for any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof.

 



 

(f) _Subsequent Offering Period_. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 2.1(f)_, Acquisition Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the
Offer to Purchase shall reserve the right to, provide for a "subsequent
offering period" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) Business
Days immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all
Company Shares that are validly tendered during the "subsequent offering
period" promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after any such Company Shares are validly tendered during the
"subsequent offering period." Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on
a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any Company Shares that
Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase during such "subsequent offering
period." The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share that is
validly tendered during the "subsequent offering period" shall be paid net to
the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub not to) commence any "subsequent offering period"
after the Acceptance Time if the Merger can be effected pursuant to either (i)

Acquisition Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any

Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.
Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change,

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall, or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent and Acquisition
Sub with such assistance and such information as Parent or its agents may
reasonably request in order to disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Company Shares, including a list, as
of the most recent practicable date, of the stockholders of the Company,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer files containing the
names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Company Shares,
and lists of security positions of Company Shares held in stock depositories
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of

2.3 _Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of
Exchange Act_.

 



 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon
the initial acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub of Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time," the use of which term herein
shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent
shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time
thereafter (as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority
of the outstanding Company Shares), Parent shall be entitled to designate up
to such number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded
up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and
Acquisition Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding Company Shares. Following a request by Parent, the Company
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, take all action necessary to cause
the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board, including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the
size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing
the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to
enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board. From time to time after the Acceptance Time (as long as
Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the outstanding
Company Shares), at the request of Parent, the Company shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, take all action necessary to cause the individuals so
designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding
up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or equivalent governance body) of
each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of each such board of
directors (or equivalent governance body) of each Subsidiary of the Company,
in each case to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the Acceptance Time until the Effective
Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
Board to always have at least two (2) directors who are directors on the date
hereof, who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates or
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent
directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (the
"Continuing Directors"); _provided_ that, if the number of Continuing
Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever, the
remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate any other
Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate or employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; _provided further_ ,
that the remaining Continuing Director shall fill such vacancies as soon as
practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further
_provided_ that if no such Continuing Director is appointed in such time
period, Parent shall designate such Continuing Director; _provided further_ ,
that if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two (2) Persons who shall not be Affiliates, consultants,
representatives or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Company's obligation to
appoint Parent's designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the
Company's receipt of sufficient information from Parent to enable the Company
to include in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in respect of Parent's
designees to the Company Board. The Company shall take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors
and officers, as well as Parent's designees to the Company Board, as is
required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in
writing, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself
and its designees to the Company Board required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or
appointment of Parent's designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on
the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of
this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition
Sub, (iv) any exercise, enforcement or waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, (v)
any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
that would adversely affect the Company Stockholders, and (vi) any other
action (including any determination, approval or authorization) to be taken or
not to be taken on behalf of the Company under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided however,_ that
following the Acceptance Time, Parent may cause its designees elected or
appointed pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ to withdraw or modify any Company
Board Recommendation Change that may have been made prior to such time without
the approval of the majority of the Continuing Directors. The Continuing
Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company) at the expense of the Company for the purpose
of fulfilling their obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority, after
the Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

 



   



 

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Acquisition Sub an option
(the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this _Section 2.4_, to purchase that number of authorized and
unissued Company Shares (the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest
number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub at the time of such
exercise, shall constitute 100 Company Shares more than 90% of the sum of the
following: (A) the total number of Company Shares outstanding immediately
after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares plus (B) the total number of
Company Shares that are issuable pursuant to the Company Warrants outstanding
at such time (including any such Company Warrants that have been conditionally
exercised prior to such time) (the "Short-Form Threshold") (assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i) if the Merger can be effected
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL; (ii) unless immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, Acquisition Sub
would own more than the Short-Form Threshold; (iii) for a number of Company
Shares in excess of the Company's then authorized and unissued Company Shares
(treating any Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company as unissued)
or (iv) if any applicable Law or any applicable Order shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery
of the Top-Up Option Shares comply with all applicable Law, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares
under the Securities Act. Provided that no applicable Law or Order shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares in respect thereof, Acquisition Sub may exercise the Top-Up
Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the Acceptance Time
and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The aggregate
purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased by
Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price,
without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Acquisition Sub, at its
election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the
aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note, which shall have full recourse
against Parent and Acquisition Sub, having a principal amount equal to the
remainder of such purchase price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during the
period in which any portion of the principal amount of such promissory note
remains outstanding, as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on
a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount of such promissory note from
the date such promissory note is originally issued until the date of payment
in full of such promissory note, and may be prepaid without premium or
penalty. The unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory
note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (x)
Acquisition Sub fails to make any payment of interest on the promissory note
as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of thirty (30)
days or (y) Acquisition Sub files or has filed against it any petition under
any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the benefit
of creditors. Such promissory note shall have no other material terms.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) In the event Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company one (1) Business Day prior
written notice (the "Top-Up Notice") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares that Acquisition Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, (ii) the manner in which Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable
purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares by Acquisition Sub is to take place. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable after receipt of the Top-Up Notice,
deliver a written notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub confirming the number
of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore (the "Top-
Up Notice Receipt"). At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub a certificate representing such Top-Up
Option Shares, or if the Company does not then have certificated shares, the
applicable number of Uncertificated Shares. The parties hereto agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of such
Top-Up Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed
received by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.2_, and if not so consummated
on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and as contemplated by _Section
7.4(c)_ as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on
the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

(d) Parent and Acquisition Sub understand that the Company Shares which
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Acquisition Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Acquisition Sub
is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) In determining the fair value of any Dissenting Company Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, any dilutive impact on the value of the
Company Shares as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares or
receipt of any promissory note issued to pay any portion of the purchase price
for such Top-Up Option Shares shall not be taken into account.

 



 

 **Article III **

3.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth

the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers

Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

3.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to
the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and such amended and restated certificate of
incorporation shall become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation (subject to the
provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_); _provided, however_ , that at the Effective
Time the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Vitacost.com,
Inc."

 



 

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of
_Section 7.10(a)_, the bylaws of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving

Corporation and such bylaws (subject to the provisions of _Section 7.10(a)_).

 



 

3.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of Acquisition Sub

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Company

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the
holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 



 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the common stock, par value
$0.00001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Company Shares, (B) any Dissenting Company Shares, and (C) Non-Cancelled
Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price (the
"Merger Consideration"), without interest thereon, upon the surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in _Section 3.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in _Section
3.10_). Each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Company
Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated
book-entry form shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
securities, except the right to receive the consideration to which such holder
may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 3.7(a)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Company Shares"), shall be
automatically cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by any
Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Acquisition Sub) ("Non-
Cancelled Company Shares") will remain outstanding with appropriate adjustment
to the number thereof to preserve the relative percentage interest in the
Company represented by such shares.

 



 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the consummation of the
Offer and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
all Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.7(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL), except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be
considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section
3.8_.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.8_ to pay for Company Shares for which appraisal rights have been
perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



 

(d) _Company Options_. Parent shall not assume any Company Options in
connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company or any holder of such Company Option, (i) the vesting of each Company
Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be accelerated in full, (ii) each Company Option that remains
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and terminated as of the Effective Time, and (iii) each holder of each such
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to be paid at or promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section
3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Offer Price, _less_ the per share exercise price
of such Company Option (the "Option Consideration") (it being understood and
agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Company by
the holder of a Company Option). For the avoidance of doubt, if the aggregate
exercise price payable upon exercise of a Company Option equals or exceeds the
product of the Offer Price _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Option, such Company Option shall be
cancelled for no consideration.

 



 

(e) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Parent shall not assume any Company
Restricted Stock Units in connection with the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company Restricted Stock
Unit, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that remains outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the
Effective Time and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be
paid at or promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the number of Company Shares
subject to such cancelled Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by the Offer Price
(the "Restricted Stock Unit Consideration").

 



 

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by _Section 3.7(d)_ and _Section 3.7(e)_ under all
Company Option and Company Restricted Stock Unit agreements and any other plan
or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof. Within three (3) business days after the Closing, Parent
shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Surviving
Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay (i) to
each of the holders of Company Options, the applicable Option Consideration
and (ii) to each of the holders of Company Restricted Stock Units, the
applicable Restricted Stock Unit Consideration, as promptly as practicable
(and in no event later than the next regular payroll date) thereafter.

 



 

 



   



 

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or promptly following the Closing, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the
holders of Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ ,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article III_. Until disbursed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds
shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America
or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such cash amount
being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required
for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this
_Article III_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by this _Article III_.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares and (ii)
uncertificated Company Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case,
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such holder's transferred
Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred
Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section
3.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership
of Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment
has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by
Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 



 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Shares, Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable
Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such Company Shares for exchange pursuant
to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to
which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
such date on which the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by the Payment Agent, the posting, by such holder of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent with respect to such Certificate, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

 



 

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

 



 

 



   



 

 **Article IV ** 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), or (ii) as
disclosed in the body of (i.e. not including the exhibits) any Company SEC
Reports that were filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company between
January 1, 2014 and the date hereof and are publicly available (other than in
any "risk factor" disclosure or any other forward looking statements or any
other statements that are similarly cautionary, nonspecific or predictive in
nature set forth therein), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets, except where the failure to be in good standing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is not in material violation of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

 



 

4.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its covenants and obligations hereunder and, subject in the case of
the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally, and (b) is subject to general principles of
equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

 



 

4.3 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares (the "Requisite Stockholder
Approval"), is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company
Capital Stock that, absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, would have been
necessary under applicable Law and the Company's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 



 

 



   



 

4.4 _Non-Contravention_. The Company has delivered to Parent correct and
complete copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws as amended as
of the date of this Agreement. The execution and delivery by the Company of
this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (b) subject to obtaining the Consents set forth in
_Section 4.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or
result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any Material Contract, (c)
assuming the Consents referred to in _Section 4.5_ are obtained or made and,
in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law or Order
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
properties or assets are bound, or (d) result in the creation of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (b),
(c) and (d) above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations,
accelerations or Liens which would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder. The
Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of the
minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts
thereof) of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of Directors and each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2013.

 



 

4.5 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental Authority
is required on the part of the Company in connection with the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) the filing and recordation of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and such filings with Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable laws
of states in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do
business, (b) such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or
state securities laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act, (c) Consents required under, and compliance with any
other applicable requirements of the HSR Act, and (d) such other Consents, the
failure of which to obtain would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder.

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

(c) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal
controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act), which are effective in providing reasonable assurance

an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or
Acquisition Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of

participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) enter into any Contract

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
6.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time
and after providing Parent not less than 24 hours written notice of its
intention to take such actions, if the Company receives from any Person a
_bona fide,_ written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal not involving a
breach of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Company's
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) either constitutes or is
reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may,
directly or indirectly through the Company's Representatives: (i) participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person and/or (ii) furnish
to such Person any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and/or afford such Person access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or the personnel, of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under this clause (ii)
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ , that
contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent;
_provided however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties, and (B) the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person, a copy of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
with such Person, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and of the
Company's intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person, (and shall include
with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of
such Person relating to such Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Company's Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the Company.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate,
amend, modify or waive any rights under, or release any Person (other than
Parent and Acquisition Sub) from, any "standstill" or other similar agreement
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such
Person, on the other, unless the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent if any director or executive
officer of the Company becomes aware of any receipt by the Company of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (and shall include with such notice copies of any
written materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and
the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional written
materials received that relate to such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request).

cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the

would reasonably be expected to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or the ability of such party to fully perform its obligations under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company

analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a
Governmental Authority regarding the Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each
other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate) with copies of all written

one another in good faith to: (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by this _Section 7.2_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by this _Section 7.2_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely
any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the
parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, as soon as practicable following
the Acceptance Time, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall jointly
prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use
in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders
for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, as the other may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof
with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or
that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents or other representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon
as reasonably practicable). The Company shall provide in writing to Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after such receipt,
and the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to
any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any such response, to which the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel) and to participate in any discussions with
the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ ,
subject to the terms of _Section 7.5_, the Company shall include the portion
of the Company Board Recommendation relating to the Merger and the adoption of
this Agreement in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

7.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Short-Form Merger_.

 



 

(a) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the

practicable following the date hereof solely for the purpose of voting upon
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
in the event that the Merger can be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, then following the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time (and in any event within one (1) Business Day), without a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 251(h)
of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, or shall cause or permit
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives to, take any action that
could render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
in the event that the Merger cannot be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL, then if Parent, Acquisition Sub and any other Subsidiary of Parent,

outstanding Company Shares following the consummation of the Offer (including,
if applicable, the exercise of the Top-Up Option), then each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

7.5 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(b)_ and _Section 7.5(c)_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer, tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
and, if required by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation").

 



 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (x)
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation; or (y) approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal; (each of clauses "(x)" and "(y)", a "Company Board
Recommendation Change"); provided, however, that a "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change. At any time following the making by any Person of a
public Acquisition Proposal, Parent may submit a written request to the
Company Board that the Company Board publicly reconfirm the Company Board
Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such a request.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board
may: (i) make a Company Board Recommendation Change only in response to the
Company receiving an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and not involving a breach of this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement or an Intervening Event; or (ii) if the
Company has complied in all respects with _Section 6.2_, cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement and, concurrently with or immediately after such
termination, cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal, which proposal did not result from any
breach of _Section 6.2_ , if and only if, in all cases (x) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with and receiving advice from
outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties and (y) the provisions of _Section 7.5(e)_ are complied with.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from: (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (ii) making any disclosure to
the Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided_
that, (x) clause (ii) of this _Section 7.5(d)_ shall not in and of itself be
deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change that would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ ,
and (y) in either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the
Company Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of _Article IX_.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) (i) No Company Board Recommendation Change may be made in response to
a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event and (ii) no termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.5(c)_ may be made: (x) until the
fourth (4th) Business Day following Parent's receipt of written notice from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to, in the case of
clause "(i)", make such Company Board Recommendation Change (a "Company Board
Recommendation Notice"), or in the case of clause "(ii)", terminate this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 7.5(e)_ (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal"), which notice shall specify (1) in the case of such an action taken
in connection with a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed
transaction documents related thereto, including definitive agreements with
respect to such Superior Proposal), or (2) if the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board is an Intervening Event, a description of the Intervening
Event; and (y) unless the Company shall have (A) during the four (4) Business
Day period specified above (and any additional period related to a revision to
the Superior Proposal, as provided below), negotiated, and caused its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the case of a Company Board
Recommendation Notice that is not related to a Superior Proposal, so that the
failure to make such Company Board Recommendation Change is no longer
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties); and (B) prior to or
concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.5(c)_, paid the Termination Fee required under _Section 9.4(b)._

 



 

The parties agree that, in the case of such actions taken in connection with a
Superior Proposal, any material amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Board
Recommendation Notice or Notice of Superior Proposal and an additional two (2)
Business Day period (the period inclusive of all such days, the "Notice
Period"). The Company agrees that: (i) during the Notice Period the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith if Parent indicates to the Company that it
desires to negotiate the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) the Company shall
take into account all changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly keep Parent
informed of all material developments affecting the material terms of any such
Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional material written materials received that relate to such Superior
Proposal).

 



 

7.6 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. None of the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue
any public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance
(it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided, however_ ,
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.6_ shall not apply to any
release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.3_ or following a Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



 

 



   



 

7.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.8 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; _provided,
however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information or (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to
a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information,; and _provided further_ , that no information or knowledge
obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 7.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition
Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such
a privilege including by providing such information in redacted form as
necessary to preserve such a privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.8_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Company's
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing. Nothing in this _Section 7.8_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any
reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section 7.8_. Except for disclosures expressly
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall hold, and shall cause their respective Representatives to
hold, all information received from the other party or its Representatives,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

7.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

7.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all: (i) indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers as of the date of this Agreement and any person who becomes a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Acceptance Time (the "Indemnified Persons") and (ii) indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and
during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or
otherwise modified in a manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as
required by applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section
7.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Person's capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether
such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at
or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section
7.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at the Acceptance
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification.
In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof
after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the
defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any
right to object to the Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person,
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.10(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.10(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ that, if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
the DandO Insurance _provided_ , that, without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company may not expend per year coverage in excess of the Maximum
Annual Premium for such "tail" policy. In the event that the Company elects to
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section
7.10(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.10_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this _Section 7.10_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

 



 

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.10_ shall be joint and
several.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

 



   



 

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
provide compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity based benefits
and individual employment agreements) to Continuing Employees that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (i) the Employee Plans and
any other employee benefit plans or other compensation and severance
arrangements of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(together, the "Company Plans" but excluding equity based benefits and
individual employment agreements) on the date of this Agreement, or (ii) the
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent ("Parent Plans"). In each case, base salary or regular
wages as of the Acceptance Time shall not be decreased for a period of one
year for any Continuing Employee who continues to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate during that period.

 



 

(b) To the extent that a Company Plan or Parent Plan is made available to
any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans)
(such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any
such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Acceptance Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall
not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit
future accruals.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.11_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time.

 



 

 



   



 

7.12 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

7.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3)
of _Annex A_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.13(a)_.

 



 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of
Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.13(b)_.

 



 

 



   



 

7.14 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of
any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of
its directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parent's prior consent (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

7.15 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall, in accordance
with the terms of the Company Warrants, deliver notices to the holders of the
Company Warrants, which notices shall inform such holders of the Offer and the
Merger and contain such other information as the Company reasonably determines
to be required pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants, and Acquisition
Sub and the Company shall permit such holders to participate in the Offer
through the conditional exercise of such Company Warrants and tender of the
underlying Company Shares received upon such exercise into the Offer.

 



 

 **Article VIII ** 

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

Time, of each of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. If the Company Stockholders are
required under the DGCL to adopt this Agreement in order to consummate the
Merger, the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.

 



 

(b) _Purchase of Company Shares_. Acquisition Sub shall have accepted for
payment and paid for all of the Company Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(c) _No Legal Prohibition_. No Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction in the United States shall have (i) enacted, issued or
promulgated any Law that is in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and has the effect of making the Merger illegal in the United States or
which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation
of the Merger in the United States, or (ii) issued or granted any Order that
is in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has the effect
of making the Merger illegal in the United States or which has the effect of
prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger in the
United States.

whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the principal cause of or resulted in (i) any of the conditions to the

failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, or (ii) the

other obligations under this Agreement, or any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement shall
have become inaccurate, which breach, violation or inaccuracy is incapable of
being cured, or is not cured, by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub within twenty
(20) calendar days following receipt of written notice from the Company of

9.2 _Termination Before or After Acceptance Time and Prior to Effective
Time_. Notwithstanding the prior adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, this Agreement may be terminated and

parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of _Section 7.6_, this _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_ and _Article

that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable,
from any liability or damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall
not be limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby resulting
from any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in
equity. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

 



   



 

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 9.4_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is
consummated. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent all of the Expenses
of Parent and Acquisition Sub. As used herein, "Expenses" means all out-of-

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $9,275,000 (the "Termination Fee"), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by
Parent, in the event that: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ solely as a result of the failure to
satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to such termination; and (B) following the

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ solely as a result of the failure to
satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to such termination, a Competing
Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly announced or shall have
become publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been withdrawn
or otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12) months following the
termination of this Agreement (the "Tail Period") pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)_ solely as a result of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition
prior to such termination, the Company has entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Competing Acquisition Transaction or any Competing
Acquisition Transaction has been consummated. For purposes of the foregoing, a
"Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an
"Acquisition Transaction" except that all references therein to "more than
twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority."

 



 

(ii) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent, by wire transfer

by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, in the event
that: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section

withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C) during the Tail Period, the Company
has entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Competing
Acquisition Transaction or any Competing Acquisition Transaction has been

or accounts designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.

_Section 9.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by
Parent.

 



 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_, the receipt of such fee
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against the Company arising out of this Agreement (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

 



 

9.5 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ , that
in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company Stockholders
in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement
that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under Delaware Law
without such approval.

 



 

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the

(a) This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Support
Agreement and the Annexes hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided, however_ , the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect

EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE

BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE
TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

10.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party (or parties) under this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 



 

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a)
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other
process in any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or
assets, in accordance with _Section 10.2_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 10.10_ shall affect
the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or
does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other
state court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or
controversy arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof;
(c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d)
agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not
have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal or other state court
within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in
such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

 



 

10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT,
ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

10.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree
that the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in
the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (ii) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 



 

 



   



 

10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.
