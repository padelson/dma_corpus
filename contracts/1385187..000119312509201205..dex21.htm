-vi- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as
of September 27, 2009, among United States Surgical Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Parent_ "), Transformer Delaware Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Purchaser_
"), and Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
").

_I NTRODUCTION_

This Agreement contemplates the acquisition of the Company by the Parent on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
Purchaser will make a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to
time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all
of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), at a price of $12.00 per share of
Company Common Stock, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon
(such price, or any higher price as may be paid in the Offer in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Following consummation of the Offer,
the Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the " _Merger_ "). As
a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Parent. The Boards of Directors of each of the Purchaser and the Company
have approved and declared advisable the Offer and the Merger and adopted this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Parent has approved the Offer, the
Merger and this Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the Parent entering into
this Agreement, certain Company stockholders (the " _Principal Stockholders_
") have entered into tender and voting agreements, dated as of the date
hereof, in substantially the form set forth in _Annex II_ , pursuant to which,
among other things, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender
his, her or its shares to the Purchaser in the Offer (the " _Tender and
Voting Agreements_ ");

The Parent, the Purchaser and the Company therefore agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

THE CASH TENDER OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, and in any event no later than the 10th day
after the day on which the Purchasers intention to make the Offer is publicly
announced (which announcement will be made by the Parent on September 28,
2009), the Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to
purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price
equal to the Offer Price. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ "
shall be any day on which the principal offices of the SEC in Washington, DC
are open to accept filings other than a day on which banking   institutions located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by
Law to remain closed. Within one Business Day of the later of: (i) the
earliest date as of which the Purchaser is permitted under the Exchange Act
to accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of
which each of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_  (the " _Offer
Conditions_ ") shall have been satisfied or waived, the Purchaser shall (and
the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) accept for payment all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer. The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
Offer Conditions (and shall not be subject to any other conditions). The
Purchaser shall promptly pay (in accordance with Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act) for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) in the Offer. 

(b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendment_. The initial expiration
date of the Offer shall be either the 20th or 21st Business Day after
commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and
14d-2 under the Exchange Act). The Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve
the right to increase the Offer Price and, subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, reserve the right to waive, amend, modify or supplement
any of the Offer Conditions or other terms of the Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Parent nor
the Purchaser shall (without the prior written consent of the Company):

(i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the
Offer Price or change the Offer so that it is for fewer than all of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; 

(ii) extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer,
except (A) as required by applicable Law (including for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")) or (B) in connection with
an increase in the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer so as to
comply with applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the
SEC;

(iii) change or waive the Minimum Condition;

(iv) amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the terms
of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock or that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to prevent the consummation of the Offer or prevent or impair the ability of
the Parent or the Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(v) impose any condition to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions.

If, at any time when the Offer is scheduled to expire, any of the Offer
Conditions have not been satisfied (and the Parent or the Purchaser has not
waived such condition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), the
Purchaser shall, at the request of the Company at least one Business Day
before the then-scheduled expiration date, and may, without the consent of
the 



 

\- 2 -  Company, (x) extend the expiration date of the Offer for up to two periods
of not more than 10 Business Days each but in no event later than the Outside
Date. The Offer may be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such
expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement) only if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article VIII.

(c) _Subsequent Offering Period_.

(i) The Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, elect to
provide a subsequent offering period (not in excess of 10 Business Days) for
the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act following its
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer.

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and the Offer, the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, and the Purchaser
shall, accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered during such subsequent offering period promptly after any
such shares of Company Common Stock are tendered during any subsequent
offering period in compliance with Rule 14d-11(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

(d) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain an offer to purchase and a form of the related letter of
transmittal, the forms of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company, and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer
will be made (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Parent and the Purchaser shall
cause the Offer Documents (i) to comply in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and (ii) on the date
first filed with the SEC and on each date published, sent or given to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, not to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no covenant is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to information
supplied by the Company or any of its stockholders in writing specifically for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. Subject to the Companys compliance with
Section 1.2(e), the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or
the other Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the
other Offer Documents and to cause the Schedule TO as so amended and
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so
amended and supplemented to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents 



 

\- 3 -  and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or
dissemination to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Parent and
the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
written comments or telephonic or email notification of any oral comments the
Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC with respect
to the Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the
Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall
provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any written responses
thereto and telephonic or email notification of any oral responses thereto of
the Parent or the Purchaser or their counsel.

(e) _Provisions of Funds by the Parent_. The Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to the Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase any and all shares of Company Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(f) _Termination of Offer and Return of Tendered Shares_. Unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Purchaser shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without
the prior written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.
In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the
Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) following
such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated in accordance with this Agreement prior to the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly
return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return,
all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the tendering stockholders.

(g) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which
a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the payment
by the Purchaser for the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and
not validly withdrawn) in the Offer.

(h) _Tax Withholding_. The Parent, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer any transfer tax due and any other
amounts as the Parent, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as applicable, are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under
any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Parent, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Paying Agent to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Parent, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be.



 

\- 4 - 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Approval and Consent_. The Company hereby approves of and consents
to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and in any event no later than the 10th day after the day
on which the Purchasers intention to make the Offer is publicly announced,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") and disseminate the Schedule
14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and any other applicable Laws, to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. Except as required by applicable Law or as otherwise permitted pursuant
to Section 6.1 below, the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 shall
contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company (together
with any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof, the " _Company
Board_ ") referred to in Section 3.4(a), and the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of such recommendation. The Company shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 (i) to comply in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable U.S. federal securities and Delaware corporation
Laws, and include a copy of the written fairness opinion, dated as of the date
of this Agreement, rendered by Goldman Sachs and Co. to the Company Board in its
entirety and a fair summary of the material financial analyses presented by
Goldman Sachs and Co. to the Company Board in connection with the rendering of
such fairness opinion, and (ii) on the date first filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by the Parent or the Purchaser in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, the
Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities and Delaware corporation Laws.
Each member of the Board of Directors and each executive officer of the

Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, shall destroy all electronic copies of such information and
deliver to the Company all other copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.

1.3 _Directors._

(a) _Election of the Purchaser Designees_. After the first time at which
the Purchaser accepts for payment, and pays for, shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer satisfying the Minimum Condition (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "), and from time to time thereafter as shares of Company
Common Stock are accepted for payment and paid for by the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of members of the Company
Board (the " _Purchaser Designees_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole
number, as will give the Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal
to the product of the total number of members of the Company Board (after
giving effect to the directors elected, appointed or designated pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Parent or the Purchaser at such
time (including shares of Company Common Stock so accepted for payment) bears
to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
(determined on a fully diluted basis). In furtherance thereof, the Company
shall, upon the request of the Purchaser, use its 



 

\- 6 -  commercially reasonable efforts promptly either to increase the size of the
Company Board or to secure the resignations of such number of the Companys
incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Purchaser
Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and the Company
shall take all reasonable actions available to the Company to cause the
Purchaser Designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, the Company
shall, if requested by the Purchaser, also take all reasonable action
necessary to cause persons designated by the Purchaser to constitute at least
the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company
Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board (other than any committee of
the Company Board established to take action under this Agreement), (ii) each
board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and
(iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of directors.

(b) _Compliance with Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1_. The Companys
obligations in Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and to the applicable rules
and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company shall take all
actions required in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a),
including mailing to holders of shares of Company Common Stock the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9; _provided_ , that (i) the Parent and
the Purchaser shall have timely supplied to the Company in writing any
information with respect to the Parent, the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and (ii)
the Parent shall be solely responsible for the accuracy of any such
information provided by the Parent.

(c) _Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts
to ensure that at least two of the members of the Company Board shall, at all
times prior to the Effective Time (as defined below), be directors of the
Company who were directors of the Company on the date hereof and who are not
officers of the Company (the " _Continuing Directors_ "), provided that, if
there shall be in office fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason,
the Company Board shall cause the person designated by the remaining
Continuing Director to be appointed to fill such vacancy, and such person
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this
Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors
of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill such
vacancies who are not directors, officers, employees or Affiliates of the
Parent or the Purchaser and are "independent directors" of the Company for
purposes of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) as in effect on the date
hereof, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement. From and after the time, if any, that the
Purchaser Designees constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to
the Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any (i) amendment or
modification of this Agreement, (ii) termination of this Agreement by the
Company, (iii) extension of time for performance of any of the obligations of
the Parent or the Purchaser hereunder, (iv) waiver of any condition to the
Companys obligations hereunder, (v) exercise or waiver of the Companys
rights or remedies hereunder, (vi) amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, (vii) authorization of any agreement between the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent, the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or (viii) taking of
any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by 



 

\- 7 -  the Company Board may be effected only if there are in office one or more
Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the
Continuing Directors then in office. The Continuing Directors shall have, and
the Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to
retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and
other advisors (which may include current advisors to the Company) at
the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the
authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce

Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Parent shall prepare, and immediately
following the Closing the Company shall cause to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ "), a

the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second

other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the
Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Ropes and Gray, One International Place, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another
date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Parent and the Company.

2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate
existence of the Purchaser shall cease and the Purchaser shall be merged with
and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred
to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (b) the certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit A_ ,
until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to
Section 6.7(b) hereof, the Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately
following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of the
Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
all references to the name of the Purchaser therein shall be changed to refer
to the 



 

\- 8 -  name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance
with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL.

2.5 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of the Company Board
of Directors, other than the Purchaser Designees, to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company upon
the Effective Time.

2.6 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.6(b) and Section 2.6(c), the Company grants to the
Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Parent, the Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up
Option be exercisable for a number of shares in excess of the aggregate of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury shares by the
Company or by its Subsidiaries and the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under its certificate of
incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not otherwise
reserved for issuance to satisfy outstanding rights to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock) as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by the Purchaser, in whole but not
in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any
subsequent offering period and on or prior to the fifth Business Day after
the later of (i) the expiration date of the Offer or (ii) the expiration of
any subsequent offering period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation
of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-
Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (A)
no provision of any applicable Law, and no temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery
of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) the issuance of
Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval
of the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (C) upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Parent, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates constitutes one share
more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (D)
the Purchaser has accepted for payment and paid for all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn and (E) the
Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied; and, 



 

\- 9 -   _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement. The Purchaser shall
exercise the Top-Up Option if doing so would be lawful and would allow it to
consummate the Merger pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL. The parties hereto
shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
Top-Up Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of such
Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price. Such purchase price shall be paid by
the Purchaser (x) in cash or (y) by delivering Parents promissory note in the
principal amount of the balance of such purchase price, which promissory shall
be on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(c) In the event that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
it shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth the place and time at
which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by the Purchaser
is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
the Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option Shares, and the
Company shall cause such Top-Up Option Shares to be issued to the Purchaser
via book-entry delivery. The Purchaser shall consummate the Merger pursuant
to Section 253 of the DGCL promptly (and in any event within one Business Day)
following the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(d) The Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares
that the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), and
will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not
involving a public offering. The Parent and the Purchaser represent and
warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

2.7 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Purchaser:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock of
the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and the Parent-Owned Stock_. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or any other wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.



 

\- 10 - (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section
2.8, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.7(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.10(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and (ii)
uncertificated shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8.

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
deposit with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust
company appointed by the Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
" _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment
through the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 2.8, cash in an
amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.7(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and the
Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment
Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy the Parents obligation
to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments (net of any losses) shall be the
property of the Parent. In the event of any losses to the Payment Fund from
any investment such that the Payment Fund is diminished below the level
required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under
Section 2.8(b), the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, immediately deposit additional cash into the Payment Fund to the extent
necessary to satisfy such obligations.



 

\- 11 - (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate and each holder of
record of Uncertificated Shares (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) in the case of a holder of Certificates, instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.

(c) No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Uncertificated Shares which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is registered, if, in the case of a
Certificate, such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, and in each
case the transferor provides to Paying Agent (i) all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.8, each Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Section 2.8. As used in this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any
individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, association, trust, Governmental Entity, unincorporated organization
or other entity. 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.8(e).



 

\- 12 - (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with
this Section 2.8 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon.

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are not surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time, unclaimed Merger Consideration payable with respect to such
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Dissenting Shares
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local
or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options or Dissenting Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this
Agreement.



 

\- 13 - 2.9 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_
") granted under any stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the
Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (without
regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Option) in exchange for the
right to receive at the Effective Time, in accordance with this Section 2.9, a
lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined
below), if any, with respect to such Company Stock Option.

(b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the Purchaser
or the Parent, in respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option so
cancelled, promptly following the Effective Time (but in any event not later
than 10 Business Days), an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share
of Company Common Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest
thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that the exercise
price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect.

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a
letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options
pursuant to this Section 2.9 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Company Stock Options, which letter shall be subject to the
Parents prior review and comment. The Parent shall at all times from and
after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy
its obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section
2.9.

(d) Each Restricted Share granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and free of any vesting or other lapse restrictions immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) If the Effective Time occurs on or before the "Exercise Date" relating
to the applicable "Plan Period" in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(as such terms are defined in the Company ESPP) and there are "Options" (as
defined in the Company ESPP) then outstanding with respect to such Plan
Period, the Company Board shall, prior to such Effective Time, take such
actions as are necessary to provide that all outstanding Options shall be
cancelled as of the Closing Date, provided that notice of such cancellation
shall be given to each holder of an Option, and to the extent that such
holder does not elect to withdraw his or her participation in the Company ESPP
prior to the Effective Time, then such Option shall be deemed to have been
exercised in full on the Closing Date based on payroll deductions
then credited to his or her account as of a date determined by the Company
Board, which date shall not be less than ten (10) days preceding the Closing
Date. The Company Board shall terminate the Company ESPP prior to the
Effective Time. No new "Plan Period" shall commence after the date of this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Company ESPP_ " means the Companys
Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



 

\- 14 - (f) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and
all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be
cancelled. 

2.10 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7, but shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through

Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no Effect (by itself or when aggregated or taken
together with any and all other Effects) resulting from any of the following
shall be deemed to be or constitute a "Company Material Adverse Effect,"
or shall be taken into account when determining whether a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or could occur:

(a) general economic conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the
United States or any other country or region in the world, or conditions in
the global economy generally; 

(b) conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the securities markets,
credit markets, currency markets or other financial markets in the United
States or any other country or region in the world, including (i) changes in

world;

the transactions contemplated hereby;

(g) any actions taken or failure to take action, in each case, to which the

the terms of, or the taking of any action required or contemplated by, this
Agreement; or the failure to take any action prohibited by this Agreement;

interpretation thereof) or changes in GAAP or other accounting standards (or
the interpretation thereof);

expectations of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial performance
or results of operations for any period, or any failure by the Company
to meet any internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or
other financial performance or results of operations (it being understood that
the underlying facts or circumstances giving rise to any such change may be
taken into account in determining whether there has occurred or may, would or
could occur a Company Material Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances
are not otherwise excluded from this definition);

except to the extent such Effects resulting from the matters described in
clauses (a) through (e) and (h) disproportionately adversely affect in a
material respect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
compared to other companies that conduct business in the countries and regions
in the world and in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
conduct business. The Company has previously provided to the Parent true and

requirements specified in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 3.4(c), conflict
with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license,

such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, penalties or Liens, and for any consents or waivers not

registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any foreign or domestic

required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the affirmative vote for
adoption of the Company Voting Proposal by the holders of at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the meeting of the
Companys stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to consider the Company
Voting Proposal (the " _Required Company Stockholder Vote_ ") is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock or
other securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement. Except for the

\- 47 - ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this
Section 6.1, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms hereof (the " _Specified Time_ "), neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall not authorize or permit its
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information to, any Person
(other than the Parent or its Representatives) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this Section 6.1, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.1(c), prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may
(A) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any Person (and the Representatives of such Person) making an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (such Person, a " _Qualified
Person_ ") pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not less restrictive in
any material respect with respect to the Qualified Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
(including solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals) with any Qualified
Person (and the Representatives of such Qualified Person) regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that any material violations of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1 by any of its Representatives
shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement (including this
Section 6.1) by the Company. The Company (x) shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party, and (y) shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company and its Subsidiaries may terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of, or grant any permission or request under, any
standstill agreement relating to the submission of any unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law. The Company will promptly provide to the Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided
or made available pursuant to this Section 6.1(a) which was not previously
provided or made available to the Parent.



 

\- 48 - (b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Prior to the Specified Time:

(i) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to the Parent,
the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the Offer
or the Company Voting Proposal (a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ");

(ii) the Company shall not enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing
for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered
into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)); and

(iii) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section
6.1, adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement (including the provisions of this Section 6.1), prior to the
Acceptance Time, if (A) the Company receives a written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal from a third party, (B) such Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a material breach by the Company of this Section 6.1, and (C) the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent pursuant to a written,
binding and irrevocable offer to alter the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board may, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and/or
(y) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or substantially
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the fee required by and
pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3 and promptly following such termination
enters into a binding definitive contract for such Superior Proposal; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (1) such
Acquisition Proposal shall not have resulted from a material breach by the
Company of this Section 6.1, (2) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to the Parent, at least three Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement 



 

\- 49 -  with respect to such Superior Proposal, (3) prior to effecting such Company
Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, if requested by the Parent, make its
Representatives available during the Notice Period to discuss with the
Parents Representatives any modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that the Parent desires to propose such that such Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (4) following any
discussions described in the immediately preceding clause (3), the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material
revisions to the terms of the Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice
Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to the
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section with respect to
such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-
commenced on the date of such new notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
fewer than three Business Days remain before the then scheduled expiration
date of the Offer, the Notice Period with respect to the Company Board
effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing
clause (x) shall equal 24 hours, provided, however, that, in such a
circumstance, the Notice Period with respect to the Company terminating this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall remain three Business
Days. Any Company Board Recommendation Change shall not change the approval
of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including each of the Offer and the Merger, or to the Tender and
Voting Agreements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may make a Company
Board Recommendation Change in the absence of a Superior Proposal if the
Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board shall not make a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company has provided to the Parent at least
three Business Days prior written notice (or such shorter period as remains
prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer) advising the Parent that
the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor in reasonable detail and during such three Business Day (or shorter)
period, if requested by the Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good
faith negotiations and made its Representatives available to discuss with the
Parents Representatives any amendment to this Agreement that the
Parent desires to propose to obviate the need or reason for the Company Board
Recommendation Change.

(c) _Notices to the Parent_. From and after the date hereof and prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall within one Business Day notify the
Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
other than requests for information in the Ordinary Course of Business and,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, unrelated to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent within
such one Business Day period with the identity of such Person and a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not in
writing, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep the 



 

\- 50 -  Parent reasonably informed in writing (and in any event no later than one
Business Day) after the occurrence of any material changes, developments,
discussions or negotiations relating to such Acquisition Proposal, including
furnishing copies of any material written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall within one
Business Day notify the Parent in writing if it determines to begin providing
non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to
the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to
provide such information to the Parent, and, if the Company is a party to any
agreement that would prohibit the Company from providing such information to
the Parent, prior to providing non-public information to, or engaging in
discussions or negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement, the
Company will obtain approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow
the Company to provide such information to the Parent.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly demand to be returned (or destroyed,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement) all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person.

(f) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization, share exchange, tender offer or
other business combination involving the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
any proposal for the issuance by the Company of 20% or more of its equity
securities, (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, 20% or more of the equity securities or consolidated total assets

\- 51 -  determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement that
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be relevant,
including the timing and likelihood of consummating the
transactions contemplated by such proposal and this Agreement, and (ii) which
the Company Board has determined to be reasonably capable of being completed
on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such proposal that the Company Board determines in its
good faith judgment to be relevant.

Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Offer, and in
cooperation with the Parent, shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy

commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of The
Nasdaq Stock Market to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the shares of Company Common Stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market and the
deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act
promptly after the Effective Time. The Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25
on the Closing Date and (b) a Form 15 on the first Business Day that is at
least ten (10) days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between
the Form 25 filing date and the Form 15 filing date, the " _Delisting Period_

any reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the
Company will deliver to the Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to

expressly modified herein.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Parents officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in 



 

\- 53 -  a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all
of its properties, books, contracts, personnel and records as the Parent shall
reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Parent (a) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, assets and personnel as the Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit any
inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, (i) in connection

authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or
the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no

third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, notices,

submissions of other documents, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and
the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any
other applicable Law;

(iv) oppose any Law which has the effect of prohibiting consummation of the
Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of

any such Law vacated or made inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement.

The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such

requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. The Company and the Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to applicable
Law (including all information required to be included in the Proxy Statement
(if any) to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
Company Stockholder Approval) in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or in Section 6.5(b), it is understood and agreed that, in the case of filings
pursuant to the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws, the Parent may
redact certain sensitive financial, valuation and business information prior
to providing such documents to the Company.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Parent and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any applicable government
clearances or approvals under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,

prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to
respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law,
and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Parent and the Company shall file, no
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date of this Agreement,
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, and, as soon as may be reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, any applicable comparable
pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign
Governmental Entity. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any material analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Parent to sell, hold separate,
license or otherwise 



 

\- 55 -  dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
agree or proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any
assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit or agree to
the sale, holding separate, licensing or other disposition of, any assets of
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of the Parent or
the Company, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from, or to
avoid potential litigation or administrative action by, a Governmental Entity
or any other person or for any other reason.

(d) Each of the Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents required in connection with the
Offer and the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an
event that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
prior to or after the Effective Time.

(e) The Company shall take, or cause to be taken, the actions necessary so
that those individuals serving on the boards of directors or comparable body
of each Subsidiary of the Company will resign and be replaced by individuals
specified by the Parent effective as of the Effective Time.

6.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the Company shall obtain the
consent of the other party before issuing any other press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that these restrictions shall not apply to any
Company communications regarding an Acquisition Proposal or Company Board
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of
the other party, each party may communicate information that is
not confidential to either party with financial analysts, investors and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance
with applicable Law and may disseminate material substantially similar to
material included in a press release or other document previously approved
for external distribution by the other parties. Each party agrees to promptly
make available to the other parties copies of any written communications made
without prior consultation with the other parties.

6.7 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any
of 



 

\- 56 -  its Subsidiaries or, while a director or officer of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless
such individuals on the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and the indemnification agreements approved by the Company Board on
August 5, 2009 and in effect on the date hereof, and Parent guarantees
any such obligations of the Surviving Corporation. Each Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent that the
Company is obligated to advance expenses to such individuals on the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and the indemnification
agreements approved by the Company Board on August 5, 2009 and in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to
repay such advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable
Law.

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either
(i) maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from
the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 250%, the "
_Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting
period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a " _Reporting
Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect
for its full term, _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Surviving
Corporation taking any actions in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Parent shall
be provided the opportunity to purchase, in lieu thereof, a substitute policy
with the same coverage limits and substantially similar terms as in
the Reporting Tail Endorsement proposed to be purchased by the Surviving
Corporation. If the Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing
insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or
exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and
officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance.



 

\- 57 - (d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.7 that is denied by the Parent
and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, of which such party has Knowledge that is reasonably expected to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to become
untrue or inaccurate such that it is reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be,
until the Acceptance Time or (b) any material failure of the Parent and the
Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, of which such party has Knowledge to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ __, _however __,_
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties, the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement or the remedies available to the party
receiving such notification. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after it has actual Knowledge of any of
the following, notify the Parent of (i) any notice or other communication from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
pursuant to any contract or agreement listed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
is otherwise required to consummate the Offer or the Merger, (ii) any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened against the
Company or any of its directors, officers or Affiliates, including by any
stockholder of the Company, before any court or Governmental Entity, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in
connection with such transactions. The Company shall consult with the Parent
regarding the 



 

\- 58 -  defense or settlement of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings and shall consider the Parents views with respect to such
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings.

6.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of one year following the
Effective Time, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company
Employees") a total compensation package (including base salary, annual target
bonus opportunity, and other employee benefits, but excluding the value of
equity or other long-term incentive awards) that is substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to the total compensation package (including base salary,
annual target bonus opportunity and other employee benefits, but excluding
the value of equity or other long-term incentive awards) provided to such
employees immediately before the Effective Time.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject
to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Company Employee benefit plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is comparable to the Company Employee Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor all of the obligations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries under the severance and change in control plans and policies
set forth in Section 3.14(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and any
payments under those plans and policies will be in lieu of any other
severance under plans or policies of Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation.



 

\- 59 - (d) Except with the prior written consent of the Parent, during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall not
(i) make any discretionary contribution to the Companys 401(k) plan, other
than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) make any required contribution to the
Companys 401(k) plan in shares. If requested by the Parent in writing, the
Company shall terminate the Companys 401(k) plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall take and assume all responsibility,
steps, liability and costs necessary to either transfer, or apply for,
petitions or applications with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or the
U.S. Department of Labor for employees who are non-immigrant temporary workers
or in the process of applying for permanent residence. This includes abiding
by the terms and conditions of these petitions and applications, filing any
new documents, necessary amendments or withdrawals, and abiding by applicable
Law.

6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
is or may become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on such transactions.

6.11 _Convertible Notes_.

(a) The Company shall provide, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the indenture (the " _Indenture_ ") under which were issued the
Convertible Notes, to the trustee under the Indenture and to each Holder (as
defined in the Indenture), any notices and announcements required by the
Indenture to be delivered prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, on the Closing Date, execute such
supplemental indenture to the Indenture as may be required under the Indenture
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall take
all such further action as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms
and conditions of the Indenture in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) delivery of any
officers certificates and opinions of counsel required by the Indenture,
(ii) conducting any offer required under the Indenture to repurchase the
Convertible Notes issued thereunder and (iii) taking any such other actions
required in connection with clauses (i) and (ii).

6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Acceptance Time and (b) prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

_however_ , that a party hereto shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the issuance of any such order,

covenant in this Agreement required to be performed by such party (or
any Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

(d) by the Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to Section 1.1(b)) expires as a result of the non-
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, without the Purchaser having accepted
for payment any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and
not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party hereto shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

Affiliates (provided that the Parent is only allowed to make two such
reaffirmation requests prior to the Acceptance Time); (iv) a tender offer or
exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
commenced (other than by the Parent or an Affiliate of the Parent) and the
Company Board shall have recommended that the stockholders of the Company

Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company
Board shall have taken a neutral position, or failed to recommend against,
acceptance of such offer; or (v) after the Companys receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall have violated or breached in any
material respect its obligations under Section 6.1 with respect to such

");

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, pursuant to
the terms of Section 6.1(b), in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal;

(g) by the Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time , if there has

Agreement as provided in Section 8.1 and the payment, if due pursuant to
Section 8.3(b)(ii), of the Termination Fee, this Agreement shall immediately
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the
Parent, the Company, the Purchaser or their respective officers, directors,
stockholders or Affiliates; _provided_ that, subject to Section 8.3(d), (a)
any such termination shall not relieve any party hereto from liability
for any fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement (it being understood
that the failure of the Parent or the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay
for the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly following the Expiration Date in the
event that all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted, waived, as of the Expiration Date shall be deemed an intentional
breach by the Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement), and (b)

and shall pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Bank

representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter

inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their

or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such

specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought
and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any
other Person with respect thereto.

arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of
this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading
of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections.
The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such

the Ordinary Course of Business. 

9.13 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "

the Company, the Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(2) seeking to prohibit or make illegal the making or consummation of the

true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, does not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (2)
the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.2
that (A) are not made as of a specific date are not true and correct in all
material respects as of the Acceptance Time, as though made on and as of the
Acceptance Time, and (B) are made as of a specific date are not true and
correct in all material respects as of such date (it being understood that the

Time exceeds by more than 35,000 the number outstanding on a fully diluted
basis derived from Section 3.2 as of the date of this Agreement), and (3) the

from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or the Purchaser,
subject in each case to the terms of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or
the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time prior
to the Acceptance Time.
