estimate (the "Estimated Carryforward Payment") of the Carryforward Payment.
An "Estimated Working Capital Overage" shall exist when (and shall be equal
to the amount by which) the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Base Working
Capital and an "Estimated Working Capital Underage" shall exist when (and
shall be equal to the amount by which) the Base Working Capital exceeds the
Working Capital Estimate.   2.4. Post-Closing Adjustment   (a) Closing
Working Capital. No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver to the Seller Representative (i) a pro forma balance sheet for the
Business as of the end of the day on the Closing Date, (ii) its calculation

the Calculations, and Buyer will   11   cooperate with them in the review
process and will provide them reasonable access to all Miltex Companies

parties shall jointly select an independent accountant to do so, which the
parties initially agree will be Deloitte and Touche, if such firm will accept
such appointment. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the independent
accountant shall be limited to the items of dispute set forth in the Dispute
Notice and the independent accountants shall not make any determination even
with respect to those items other than to settle the specific dispute within
the amounts proposed by the parties. The determination made by such
independent accountant will be final and binding on the parties, and Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Seller Representative, on the other hand, will share
equally the cost of retaining such independent accountant.   (d) Adjustment
Payment.   (i) If it is determined, pursuant to this Section 2.4, that (a)

shall instruct the Escrow Agent (x) to pay from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount to Buyer the sum of (i) the excess of the Working Capital Estimate
over the Closing Working Capital and (ii) the Carryforward Overage, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (and, if the Working Capital Escrow
Amount is less than such sum, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount sufficient to make up, when combined
with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the full amount of such sum) and (y)
to pay from the Working Capital Escrow Amount to the Seller Representative
the remainder thereof, if any.   (ii) If it is determined, pursuant to this
Section 2.4, that (a) the Closing Working Capital is less than the Working
Capital Estimate, and (b) there is a Carryforward Underage, then, not later
than five (5) business days after such determination, (i) the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount to Buyer the excess of the Working Capital
Estimate over the Closing Working Capital by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (and, if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is less than the
amount of such excess, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount sufficient to make up, when combined
with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the full amount of such excess), (ii)
the Seller Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
from the Working Capital Escrow Amount to the Seller Representative the
remainder thereof, if any, and (iii) Buyer will pay to the
Seller Representative the Carryforward Underage, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the excess of
the Working Capital Estimate over the Closing Working Capital is greater than
the Carryforward Underage, then the Seller Representative and Buyer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to deduct the Carryforward Underage from the amount
the Escrow Agent is otherwise required to pay from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount   12   pursuant to clause (i) above, and Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay the Carryforward Underage to the Seller Representative
pursuant to clause (iii) above.   (iii) If it is determined, pursuant to
this Section 2.4, that (a) the Closing Working Capital is greater than the
Working Capital Estimate, and (b) there is a Carryforward Underage, then, not
later than five (5) business days after such determination, (i) Buyer will
pay to the Seller Representative the sum of (x) the excess of the Closing
Working Capital over the Working Capital Estimate and (y) the Carryforward
Underage, by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Seller Representative the Working Capital Escrow Amount.   (iv) If it is
determined, pursuant to this Section 2.4, that (a) the Closing Working
Capital is greater than the Working Capital Estimate, and (b) there is a
Carryforward Overage, then, not later than five(5) business days after such
determination (i) Buyer will pay to the Seller Representative the excess of
the Closing Working Capital over the Working Capital Estimate, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, (ii) the Seller Representative
and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the Working Capital
Escrow Amount the Carryforward Overage to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (and, if the Working Capital Escrow Amount is
less than the Carryforward Overage, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount sufficient to make up,
when combined with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the full amount of the
Carryforward Overage) and (iii) the Seller Representative and Buyer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the Working Capital Escrow Amount to
the Seller Representative the remainder thereof, if any. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the excess of the Closing Working Capital over the Working
Capital Estimate is greater than the Carryforward Overage, then the Buyer
shall deduct the Carryforward Overage from the amount it is required to pay
to the Seller Representative pursuant to clause (i) above, and the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Seller Representative the Working Capital Escrow Amount.   2.5.
Withholding   Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Purchase Price (including any amounts payable under Sections 2.3 and 2.4) and
any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, the Withholding Amount
and any other amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or
other applicable Tax Law, and shall promptly remit any such amounts to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts deducted and withheld
pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Seller or other applicable payee.   2.6.

Closing Date (the "Escrow Disbursement Date"), the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
subject to any reduction of such amount pursuant to Article 11 hereof and the
Escrow Agreement, shall be released to the Seller Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the Escrow Disbursement Date there are
one or more pending Claims (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), which have
not been the subject of a final resolution, then the Escrow Agent shall not
disburse amounts from the   13   Indemnity Escrow Amount that would
deplete the cash value of the escrow account below the amount of the Losses
so claimed, unless and until there has been final resolution of such matter
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.   ARTICLE 3   CLOSING   3.1.

and holds harmless Buyer, the Miltex Companies, its and their respective
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives (collectively, the

than any Losses specifically taken into account in the purchase price
adjustment provided for in Article 2) incurred in connection with or arising
out of:   (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller in
this Agreement or in any document delivered at the Closing; provided, that
if any representation or warranty that contains qualifications as to
materiality, Material Adverse Change or Material Adverse Effect is breached
the amount of Losses will be determined without regard to such
qualifiers;   (ii) any breach of a covenant made by Seller in
this Agreement; or   (iii) any liability by any of the Miltex Companies to,

Closing).   (b) By Buyer. Except with respect to Taxes and matters relating
to Taxes: Buyer hereby indemnifies and saves and holds harmless Seller,
Seller\'s Affiliates, and its and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the "Seller-Side Indemnified Persons"), from and against any
and all Losses (other than any Losses specifically taken into account in the
purchase price adjustment provided for in Article 2) incurred in connection
with or arising out of:   (i) any breach of a representation or warranty
made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any document delivered at the Closing;
provided, that if any representation or warranty that contains qualifications

breached, the amount of Losses will be determined without regard to such
qualifiers;   (ii) any breach of a covenant made by Buyer in this
Agreement; or   (iii) the operation of the Business by Buyer after

Section 11.3 with respect to Taxes and matters relating to Taxes:   (i)
Notice. If a claim for Losses (an "Indemnity Claim") is to be made by a party
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the party claiming such
indemnification shall give notice (an "Indemnity Claim Notice") to
the indemnifying party and the Escrow Agent as promptly as practicable after
the party entitled to indemnification becomes aware of any fact, condition or
event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought.
If any Action in the form of a lawsuit is filed against any party entitled
to indemnification hereunder, notice thereof shall be given to the
indemnifying party and the Escrow Agent as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within   41   fifteen (15) calendar days after service). The
failure of any indemnified party to give timely notice hereunder shall not
affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party suffers actual damage caused by such failure.   (ii)
Conduct of Defense. After such notice, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled, if it so elects: (x) to take control of the defense
and investigation of such Action; (y) to employ and engage attorneys of its
own choice to handle and defend the same (unless the named parties to such
Action include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
the indemnified party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may
be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in
which event the indemnified party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying
party\'s expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing); and (z) to
compromise or settle such Action, which compromise or settlement shall be
made only with the written consent of the indemnified party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the indemnifying party fails to assume
the defense of such Action within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of
the Indemnity Claim Notice, the indemnified party against which such Action
has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake, at the indemnifying party\'s
expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Action; provided,
however, that such Action shall not be compromised or settled without the
written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (d) Limits on Liability.   (i) Limits on
Liability of Seller. Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer-
Side Indemnified Person under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or (ii) unless such Losses
collectively suffered or incurred by all Buyer-Side Indemnified Persons
aggregate more than $1,000,000 (One Million Dollars) (the "Basket"), in which
event Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the applicable Buyer-Side
Indemnified Persons for the full amount of such Losses up to an aggregate
amount equal to (a) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "General Cap")
with respect to claims made prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date and (b) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Special Cap")
with respect to claims made pursuant to Section 11.3 subsequent to such
twelve (12) month anniversary and prior to the thirty-six (36)
month anniversary of the Closing Date.   (ii) Limits on Liability of Buyer.
Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller-Side Indemnified Person
under Section 11.2(b) for Losses pursuant to such Section unless such Losses
collectively suffered or incurred by all Seller-Side Indemnified Persons
aggregate more than the Basket, in which event Buyer shall be obligated to
indemnify the applicable Seller-Side Indemnified Persons for the full amount
of such Losses, up to an aggregate amount equal to the Cap, provided, that
the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the obligations of Buyer to pay
the Purchase Price under Article 2.   (e) Sole Remedy. The parties
acknowledge that, in the absence of fraud, the rights accorded to each Buyer-
Side Indemnified Person or Seller-Side Indemnified Person under this Article
11 shall be the sole rights to money   42   damages that any such Person
may have under this Agreement or for breach of this Agreement; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing in this Article 11 shall restrict or
limit any rights that any Buyer-Side Indemnified Person or Seller-Side
Indemnified Person may have to seek equitable relief.   (f) Buyer\'s Right
of Set-Off; First Remedy. Upon notice to Seller Representative specifying in
reasonable detail the basis therefore, Buyer may set off any claim under this
Article 11 against amounts owing under Section 2.4 hereof or give notice of a
claim in such amount under the Escrow Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor
the failure to exercise such right of setoff or to give a notice of a claim
under the Escrow Agreement will constitute an election of remedies or limit
Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be
available to it. Any payment of Losses to the Buyer-Side Indemnified Persons
hereunder shall be paid solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, other than
Losses pursuant to Section 11.1(a).   (g) Insurance Proceeds. Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and recover any Losses suffered
under its insurance policies (but shall not be required to bring a lawsuit to
do so), and shall remit to the Seller Representative any proceeds actually
received by Buyer with respect to Losses previously indemnified by Seller
hereunder.   11.3. Tax Indemnification   (a) Subject to the limitations
described in Section 11.1, Section 11.2(e) and this Section 11.3, and without
duplication of any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement or covered
by Section 14.5, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer-Side Indemnified Persons from and against (i) all Taxes of
the Miltex Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to the extent
such Taxes are included as current liabilities in the determination of
Closing Working Capital, (ii) all Taxes of Seller imposed on any of the
Miltex Companies, (iii) any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or
incident to any breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any covenant
contained in this Section 11.3 or Article 14, and (iv) any and all Losses
arising out of, resulting from or incident to any breach by Seller or its
Affiliates (including the Miltex Companies on or prior to the Closing Date)
of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.24, to the extent
not otherwise indemnified pursuant to the foregoing clauses
(i)-(iii) (provided, however, that a claim for a Loss that relates to a
liability for Taxes of any Miltex Company to a Governmental Authority may be
made only if such Loss arises out of, results from or is incident to a
written Tax Claim); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of all
claims for indemnification or reimbursement of Taxes made by any Buyer-Side
Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 11.3, when taken together with
the aggregate amount of all claims for other Losses made by any Buyer-Side
Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 11.2(a), may not exceed, in the
aggregate, the General Cap prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (and if notice of such claim is provided prior to such date, the
General Cap shall continue to apply to such claim until such claim is
resolved); provided, further, that the aggregate amount of all claims for
indemnification or reimbursement of Taxes made by any Buyer-Side Indemnified
Persons pursuant to this Section 11.3 may not exceed, in the aggregate, the
Special Cap for the period subsequent to the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date and prior to the thirty six (36) month  
43   anniversary of the Closing Date. From and after the thirty six (36)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, no Buyer-Side Indemnified Person may
make any claim for indemnification or reimbursement of Taxes pursuant to this
Agreement. For purposes of this Section 11.3, Taxes shall include the amount
of Taxes that would have been due and payable but for the application of any
credit or net operating loss or capital loss deduction attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period.   (b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller-Side Indemnified Persons from and
against (i) all Taxes of the Miltex Companies for any Post-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent such Taxes are attributable to a breach by
Seller or any of its Affiliates of any covenant contained in this Section
11.3 or Article 14 and (ii) any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from
or incident to the breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Miltex Companies after the Closing Date) of any covenant contained in this
Section 11.3 or Article 14.   (c) In the case of any Straddle Period:  
(i) Real, personal and intangible property Taxes or other Taxes levied on a
per diem basis (collectively, "Per Diem Taxes") of any of the Miltex
Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such
Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in the Straddle Period; and   (ii) Taxes of any of the
Miltex Companies (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date.   (d) Seller\'s indemnification obligation for Taxes for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall initially be effected by its payment to Buyer
of the excess of (i) the amount of Taxes due for such Pre-Closing Tax Period
as evidenced by a Tax Return prepared in accordance with Section 14.1 or
as otherwise indicated in a written notice prepared by Buyer over (ii) the
amount of such Taxes paid by Seller at any time plus the amount of such Taxes
paid by the Miltex Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, plus the amount
of Taxes included as current liabilities in the determination of Closing
Working Capital. The Seller Representative shall pay such excess to Buyer
within ten (10) days after written demand is made by Buyer; provided,
however, prior to the Escrow Disbursement Date, such excess may be paid to
Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; provided further, in no event shall the Seller Representative or,
if applicable, the Escrow Agent be obligated to make any such payment earlier
than five (5) days before the date on which such Taxes are required to be
paid to the relevant Governmental Authority. In the case of any contested
Tax, payment of the Tax to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall not
be considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination with
respect to such Tax liability is made by the appropriate Governmental
Authority or court.   (e) If a Governmental Authority shall make any claim
relating to Taxes that, if successful, might result in an indemnification
payment pursuant to this Section 11.3 (a "Tax Claim"), the indemnified party
shall promptly and in any event no more than fifteen (15) calendar days
following receipt of such Tax Claim, give written notice of such Tax Claim to
the indemnifying party, together with copies of all notices and
communications relating to such Tax Claim;   44   provided, however, the
failure of the indemnified party to give such notice shall only relieve the
indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations hereunder to the
extent it is actually prejudiced by such failure.   (f) The Seller
Representative shall, upon written notification to Buyer, control all
proceedings at its own expense and may make all decisions with respect to any
Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, the Seller Representative shall not settle any such Tax
Claim without Buyer\'s consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and provided further, that the Seller Representative and Buyer
shall jointly control any such Tax Claim if the resolution of such Tax
Claim reasonably would be expected to affect any of the Miltex Companies\'
liability for Taxes for any Tax Period ending after the Closing Date. The
Seller Representative and Buyer shall jointly control all proceedings with
respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period. The Seller
Representative shall promptly notify Buyer if it decides not to control the
defense or settlement of any Tax Claim which it is entitled to control or
jointly control pursuant to this Section 11.3(f), and Buyer shall thereupon
be permitted to defend and settle such proceeding.   (g) Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in contesting any Tax Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and, upon the request of the party or parties controlling
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim, the provision to such party or
parties of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax
Claim.   11.4. Character of Indemnification Payments   Seller and Buyer
agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this Article 11 as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.   ARTICLE 12   [RESERVED]   ARTICLE 13   CERTAIN POST-
CLOSING MATTERS   13.1. Post-Closing Confidentiality   After the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to maintain the
confidentiality of all Confidential Information relating to Buyer, the Miltex
Companies or the Business, including all such materials which remain in the
possession of Seller or its Affiliates, except to the extent that disclosure
of any such information is required by law or authorized by Buyer or
reasonably occurs in connection with any dispute over the terms of this
Agreement. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its  
45   Affiliates to, maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential
Information relating to Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates (other than that
relating to the Business) which Buyer or any of its Affiliates has obtained
in connection with this Agreement or with the transactions contemplated
herein, except to the extent disclosure of such information is required by
law or authorized by Seller, or reasonably occurs in connection with any
dispute over the terms of this Agreement. After the Closing, in the event
that any party reasonably believes that it or any of its Affiliates is
required by law to disclose any such Confidential Information, the disclosing
party will (i) provide the other parties with prompt notice (before such
disclosure, unless this is impractical because an applicable warrant requires
immediate disclosure) in order that such parties may attempt to obtain a
protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such confidential information and (ii) cooperate with such other
parties in attempting to obtain such order or assurance.   ARTICLE 14  
TAX AND ACCOUNTING MATTERS   14.1. Preparation of Tax Returns   (a) Except
as otherwise provided in Section 14.5 with respect to Transfer Taxes, Buyer
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Miltex
Companies relating to any Straddle Period and Seller shall prepare (or cause
to be prepared) all Tax Returns relating to Tax Periods ending on or before
the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Buyer
and Seller agree to prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Miltex Companies
for any Tax Period that includes the Closing Date on the basis that such Tax
Period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date unless the relevant
Governmental Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis. Each
party shall have the right to review and comment on any Tax Returns prepared
by the other party pursuant to this Section 14.1(a) prior to filing, and each
party shall make any changes to such Tax Returns as reasonably requested by
the other party. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.3 and this Article
14, Buyer shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) with
the appropriate Governmental Authority when due all Tax Returns of each of
the Miltex Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required
to be filed after the Closing Date (including, without limitation, a federal
income Tax Return for Miltex Holdings and the Miltex Subsidiaries that are
entities formed in the United States (the "U.S. Subsidiaries") for the Tax
Period ending on the Closing Date) and Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns prepared pursuant
to this Section 14.1 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless a contrary position is required under applicable Law) and,
in the case of any Tax Return that includes the Closing Date, Buyer and
Seller will cause the Miltex Companies to claim deductions for the Tax
Savings Expenses and any other deductions that lawfully may be claimed and
will consult with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or other nationally recognized
accounting firm that may be mutually agreed to by Buyer and the Seller
Representative) regarding the proper allocation of such deductions among
Miltex Holdings, its U.S. Subsidiaries and any other Miltex Companies. Buyer
shall not elect, and shall not permit the Miltex Companies to elect, to waive
the carryback of any net operating loss attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including, without limitation, the Tax Period that ends on the
Closing Date) pursuant to Code Section 172(b)(3) or any similar provision of
foreign, state, or local income Tax Law.   46    (b) Buyer shall provide
copies of all Tax Returns (or the portions thereof relating to the Miltex
Companies) relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are filed after the
Closing Date to the Seller Representative and shall not, except as provided
in Section 14.2(a), file any amended Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Miltex Companies without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).   14.2. Tax Refunds   Any refund,
rebate, abatement or other recovery (whether directly or indirectly through a
right of setoff or credit) of Taxes (including payments of estimated Taxes)
of any of the Miltex Companies and any interest thereon (collectively, a "Tax
Refund") with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that is not included in
Closing Working Capital shall be for the account of Seller, other than any
Tax Refund resulting from a carryback of a net operating loss, credit or
other loss or deduction from a Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall pay to
the Seller Representative the amount of any such Tax Refund as promptly as
practicable after Miltex Holdings or any of the other Miltex
Companies receives the Tax Refund (or receives the benefit of the Tax Refund
through a right of offset or credit). Seller shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) at Seller\'s expense, and Buyer shall promptly cause Miltex
Holdings to file, any required Tax Return (including, without limitation,
amended Tax Returns reflecting a carryback of losses) that may be necessary
to enable the Miltex Companies to obtain any such Tax Refund; provided,
however, that any claim for a Tax Refund for a Pre-Closing Tax Period on the
basis of a carryback of a net operating loss attributable to deductions for
Tax Savings Expenses shall be filed on IRS Form 1120X and comparable state,
local and foreign tax forms; provided, further, that, if any action is
required to be taken beyond the filing of any Tax Return in order to obtain a
Tax Refund, Seller shall pay all reasonable expenses in connection with the
pursuit of such Tax Refund. Buyer shall, upon the Seller Representative\'s
written request, promptly prepare and prosecute a claim or suit for a refund
of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided that Seller shall pay all
reasonable expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of
such claim or suit.   14.3. Cooperation on Tax Matters   Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
and in resolving all disputes and audits relating to Taxes. Seller and Buyer
agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Miltex Companies relating to any Tax Period beginning before
the Closing Date until the applicable statute of limitations has expired and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority; (ii) to allow the other party and its representatives
at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and
make copies of such records as such party may deem necessary or appropriate
from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business
hours at such party\'s expense; and (iii) to give the other party reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if the other party so requests, Seller and Buyer, as the
case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.   47    14.4. Withholding Forms   At or prior to Closing,
Seller shall provide Buyer with (i) a properly executed IRS Form W-9, (ii) a
statement executed by Seller, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer,
that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1445-2(b)(2),
and (iii) any other certifications, affidavits, forms or documents required
to be delivered to Buyer under any applicable Tax Law in order to relieve
Buyer of any obligation to withhold any portion of the Purchase Price
(including any amounts payable under Sections 2.3 and 2.4).   14.5. Transfer
Taxes   All Transfer Taxes shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in preparing and timely filing all Tax
Returns and other documentation relating to such Transfer Taxes as may be
required by applicable Tax Law.   14.6. Section 338 Election; Ordinary
Course of Business   Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall make an
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the purchase of the
Shares of Miltex Holdings or any stock that is held, directly or indirectly,
by Miltex Holdings without Seller\'s prior written consent. Buyer agrees not
to cause any of the Miltex Companies to engage in any transaction on the
Closing Date after the Closing that is outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Miltex Companies, except for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   14.7. Tax Sharing Agreements   Seller shall cause any
Tax sharing agreement or similar arrangement to which any Miltex Company is a
party to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date,
no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing
agreement or similar agreement.   14.8. Tax Benefit Payment.   No later
than March 31, 2007, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to 19% of the
amount of the Miltex Companies\' federal charitable contribution carryforward
from a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is deducted on Buyer\'s
federal consolidated income Tax Return for its 2006 tax year.   ARTICLE
15   MISCELLANEOUS   15.1. Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries  
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties;
except that Buyer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to one or
more of its Affiliates, provided, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer
of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and  
48   inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and no other Person (including any Business
Employee) shall have any right, benefit or obligation under this Agreement as

GmbH Meisterhand Instrumente GmbH Miltex Dental, Inc. Miltex Dental
Technologies, Inc. Miltex Dental Instruments, Inc. EndoSolutions,
Inc.        Exhibit 1.1(a)   Calculation of Working
Capital  Working Capital means, as of any date, the sum of certain current
assets categories (as defined below) of the Miltex Companies less the sum of
certain current liabilities categories (as defined below) of the Miltex
Companies.  "Current assets" categories are:  (a) Cash  (b) accounts
receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, other than  receivables
from Affiliates  (c) inventory, net of reserves calculated as set forth
below  (d) prepaid expenses and other current assets, excluding any assets
associated  with forward currency exchange, interest rate swap, or other
hedging  arrangements, and excluding any deferred Tax assets and/or Tax
Refunds  "Current liabilities" categories are:  (a) accounts payable,
other than payables to Affiliates  (b) accrued expenses, excluding accrual
of interest expenses relating to  indebtedness and forward currency exchange,
interest rate swap, or other  hedging arrangements but including accrued
vacation time and bonus  (including bonuses to be paid to employees of the
Miltex Companies in  connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby)  Except as set forth above, each current assets
category and each current liabilities category are defined consistently with
past practices of the Miltex Companies and in accordance with the Financial
Statements.  Any Transaction Fees incurred by the Miltex Companies, to the
extent not paid by Closing, will be reflected in current liabilities as of
the Closing.  Notwithstanding the general principles in the definition of
Closing Working Capital, all Tax liabilities related to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period ending on the Closing Date included in current liabilities shall be
calculated after giving effect to the deductions described in the Tax Savings
Expenses that can be claimed during the portion of the Pre-Closing Tax Period
that is deemed to end on the Closing Date. No liabilities shall be included
in the current liabilities for any potential Taxes relating to intercompany
transactions between any Miltex Company and Miltex Technology Corp.  For
the avoidance of doubt, excess and obsolete inventory and
corresponding reserves shall be calculated using the following methodology,
consistent with past practices of the Miltex Companies:   An Inventory part
is considered obsolete if the part has not  been sold over the last 12
months, and it will be reserved at  100% of fully loaded cost, which includes
material, labor, and  overhead allocation costs. Inventory part is considered
excess  that which exceeds last 2 years\' part sales. Such excess  inventory
part is reserved at 50% of the fully loaded cost for  the inventory.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each inventory  part considered obsolete or
excess is subject to a special  circumstances test. If such inventory part is
considered to  meet a special circumstance, that inventory part is
removed     from excess or obsolete category and corresponding inventory 
reserves are removed. "Special circumstances" include: (i) a  new part whose
sale history is deemed insufficient by Miltex  Companies managers to be used
to determine its state of excess  or obsolescence, (ii) private label part
that has been  custom-marked for a customer, and for which the customer has 
the obligation to purchase, and (iii) other specific  situations as
determined at the discretion of certain Miltex  Companies managers. Data used
to determine excess and obsolete  inventory parts and corresponding reserves
is downloaded from  Miltex Companies\' Dataflo database.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no obligations of the Miltex Companies paid by Buyer from the
Purchase Price at the Closing shall be included as a current liability in
calculating the Closing Working Capital.   The following is an example of
the calculation of Working Capital for the Miltex Companies dated as of
December 31, 2005:     As of December 31, 2005  ~~   Cash $ 216,000
