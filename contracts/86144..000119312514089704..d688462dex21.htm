3  holder thereof, without interest (the " _Initial Cash Merger Consideration_
"), (B) one contingent value right to receive, subject to the terms of the
Casa Ley CVR Agreement, the Casa Ley CVR Payment Amount (such right, a "
_Casa Ley CVR_ "); _provided_ , that (1) in the event that the Entire Casa Ley
Sale is consummated prior to the Closing, the holder of such Company Share
shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the Casa Ley CVR (or, in the event
of an Entire Casa Ley Sale with any deferred cash consideration (including any
escrow or holdback amount) still remaining to be paid thereunder, in addition

an amount in cash equal to the quotient of (x) the Casa Ley Net Proceeds,
_divided by_ (y) the number of Closing Company Shares, (2) in the event one or
more Partial Casa Ley Sales (that, collectively, do not constitute the Entire
Casa Ley Sale) are consummated prior to the Closing, the holder of such
Company Share shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the Casa Ley CVR,
an amount in cash equal to the quotient of (x) the Partial Casa Ley Net
Proceeds with respect to such Partial Casa Ley Sale(s) divided by (y) the
number of Closing Company Shares and (3) in the event that the Entire Casa Ley
Sale or any Partial Casa Ley Sale is consummated prior to the Effective Time,
the holder of such Company Share shall be entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to the quotient of (x) the product of (A) any cash amounts received
(without duplication of any amounts paid to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with any Entire Casa Ley Sale or Partial Casa Ley
Sale) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from and after January 1, 2014
and prior to the Closing as a dividend or distribution due to its direct
or indirect ownership of Equity Interests in Casa Ley and (B) 60.75%,
_divided by_ (y) the number of Closing Company Shares (such cash payable
pursuant to (1), (2) and/or (3) of this proviso, (the " _Casa Ley
Cash Consideration_ "), (C) one contingent value right to receive, subject to
the terms of the PDC CVR Agreement, the PDC CVR Payment Amount (such right, a
" _PDC CVR_ "); _provided_ , that (1) in the event that the Entire PDC Sale
is consummated prior to the Closing and PDC repays all outstanding amounts due
under the Company-PDC Loans, the holder of such Company Share shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu of the PDC CVR (or, in the event of an Entire PDC
Sale with any deferred cash consideration (including any escrow or holdback
amount) still remaining to be paid thereunder, in addition to the PDC CVR
issued in respect of such deferred cash consideration), an amount in cash
equal to the quotient of (x) the PDC Net Proceeds remaining after repayment
in full and termination of the Company-PDC Loans pursuant to _Section
5.4(c)_, _divided by_ (y) the number of Closing Company Shares, (2) in the
event that one or more Partial PDC Sales (that, collectively, do not
constitute the Entire PDC Sale) are consummated prior to the Closing and PDC
repays the PDC Loan Mandatory Prepayment Amount applicable to such Partial PDC
Sales, the holder of such Company Share shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to the PDC CVR, an amount in cash equal to the quotient of (x) the
Partial PDC Net Proceeds with respect to such Partial PDC Sales remaining
after repayment of the PDC Loan Mandatory Prepayment Amount applicable to
such Partial PDC Sales, _divided by_ (y) the number of Closing Company Shares,
and (3) in the event that the Entire PDC Sale or any Partial PDC Sale is
consummated, the holder of such Company Share shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to the quotient of (x) the product of (A) any amounts
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing as
dividends or distributions paid from the operating earnings of PDC due to
its direct or indirect ownership of PDC (without duplication of any amounts
paid to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with any Entire
PDC Sale or Partial PDC Sale) and (B) 60.75% divided by (y) the number of
Closing Company Shares (such cash payable pursuant to (1), (2) and/or (3) of
this proviso, the " _PDC Cash Consideration_ ") and (D) if the Closing shall
not have occurred on

 



4  or prior to the Initial End Date, an amount in cash equal to $0.005342 per
Company Share per day for each day during the period commencing on (and
including) the Initial End Date and ending on (and including) the date of the
Closing (the " _Additional Cash Merger Consideration_ " and such
consideration, together with any Casa Ley Cash Consideration, any PDC Cash
Consideration and the Initial Cash Merger Consideration, the " _Cash Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, such Company Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Company Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ "), or any such Company Shares that are non-
certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry shares (" _Book Entry
Shares_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be
paid in consideration therefor, without interest (subject, in the case of any
holder of a Certificate, to the surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with _Section 2.2_). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ " shall mean the Cash Merger Consideration, together
with (A) the Casa Ley CVR, if applicable, and (B) the PDC CVR, if applicable.

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Company Shares_. Each Company Share held (i) by
any Parent Entity or any of their Affiliates or (ii) in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in each case, be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto. Each Company Share held by any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding and shall not be entitled
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Changes in Company Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares, by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination, or exchange
of shares, then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Ultimate Parent shall
appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Cash Merger
Consideration to which holders of shares shall be entitled under _Section
2.1(a)_ (other than the Exempted Company Shares). On and after the Effective
Time, the Parent Entities shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, sufficient funds to pay the Cash Merger Consideration to which
holders of Closing Company Shares (other than the Exempted Company Shares)
shall be entitled under _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in amounts
and at the times necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including as
a result of losses), the Payment Fund is insufficient to pay the amounts to
which

 



5  holders of Company Shares shall be entitled under _Section 2.1(a)_, the
Parent Entities shall take all steps necessary to deposit or cause to be
deposited in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make
all payments required under this Agreement, and the Parent Entities and the
Surviving Corporation shall in any event be jointly and severally liable from
and after the Effective Time for the payment thereof. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Payment Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts payable to which holders of
Company Shares shall be entitled under _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly
returned to Ultimate Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent Entities shall send, or
cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of Company Shares (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent or upon transfer of
the Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in
customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares
(as applicable) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon (x)
surrender of Certificates (or delivery of affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
properly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required by the
Paying Agent or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent to
effect the transfer and cancellation of the Book Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request),
the holder of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Company Shares represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares, and the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) and Book Entry Shares so surrendered or transferred
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of Book Entry Shares. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee
if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each such Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender or transfer the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) with
respect to the Casa Ley CVRs, the payment of any Casa Ley CVR Payment and the
exchange procedures with respect thereto shall be governed by the terms of
Section 2.4 of the Casa Ley CVR Agreement and (B) with respect to the PDC
CVRs, the payment of any PDC CVR Payment Amount and exchange procedures with
respect thereto shall be governed by the terms of Section 2.4 of the PDC CVR
Agreement.

 



6 (c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Per Share Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Shares for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holders who have not exchanged Company Shares for the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Cash Merger
Consideration (and the Surviving Corporation shall thereafter make payment of
the Cash Merger Consideration to any such holders, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of Company Shares to the Surviving Corporation).

(e)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent
Entities nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Company Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Paying Agent the posting by such Person of a bond in a
reasonable and customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section
2.2(e)_, the Surviving Corporation) will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Cash Merger Consideration, to be paid in
respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(g) _Withholding_. Each of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Parent Entities, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
the Rights Agent as the case may be, such amounts shall be remitted in
accordance with applicable Tax Law and treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Stockholder Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Company Shares held by
a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of, or
validly consented to in writing, the adoption of this Agreement and who has
properly demanded and not withdrawn a demand for

 



7  appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Provisions_
"), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, but shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)_, but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
the Appraisal Provisions. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Dissenting Stockholders
right of appraisal pursuant to the Appraisal Provisions, then (a) each of such
Dissenting Stockholders Company Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, (b)
subject to _Section 2.2(d)_, the Parent Entities shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of Company Shares for which such Dissenting
Stockholder has failed to perfect, withdrawn its demand for, or lost its
rights to appraisal pursuant to the Appraisal Provisions and (ii) the Cash
Merger Consideration, (c) in the event that the Entire Casa Ley Sale has not
been consummated prior to the Closing, the Rights Agent shall issue to such
Dissenting Stockholder a number of Casa Ley CVRs equal to the number of
Company Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has failed to perfect,
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to appraisal pursuant to the
Appraisal Provisions and (d) in the event that the Entire PDC Sale has not
been consummated prior to the Closing, the Rights Agent shall issue to such
Dissenting Stockholder a number of PDC CVRs equal to the number of Company
Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has failed to perfect, withdrawn
its demand for, or lost its rights to appraisal pursuant to the Appraisal
Provisions. Any Casa Ley CVR or PDC CVR to which a Dissenting Stockholder
would be entitled but for this _Section 2.3_ shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of determining the amount to be paid per such
Casa Ley CVR or PDC CVR. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts
to give Ultimate Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisals of Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to control
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Ultimate
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), make any payment or offer or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer or agree to settle any
such demands.

plan of the Company, including the 1999 Amended and Restated Equity
Participation Plan, the 2007 Equity and Incentive Award Plan and the
2011 Equity and Incentive Award Plan or any other plan, agreement or
arrangement (collectively, the " _Company Equity Incentive Plans_ "), whether
or not then exercisable or vested, shall be accelerated, vested and cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Option and in settlement therefor, (i) an amount in cash (subject
to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (A) the total
number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Cash Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share of

 



8  such Company Option (the " _Option Price_ ") (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the " _Option Payment_ "), (ii) in the event that the
Entire Casa Ley Sale has not been consummated prior to the Effective Time,
one Casa Ley CVR in respect of each Company Share subject to such cancelled
Company Option that has an Option Price less than the Cash Merger
Consideration; and (iii) in the event that the Entire PDC Sale has not been
consummated prior to the Effective Time, one PDC CVR in respect of each
Company Share subject to such cancelled Company Option that has an Option
Price less than the Per Share Cash Consideration. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to (1) the payment of the Option Payment and (2) if applicable, the receipt of
Casa Ley CVRs and/or PDC CVRs. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company

Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_.

 

(c) _Performance Share Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
performance share award covering Company Shares that is outstanding and that

and shall be cancelled in exchange for an (i) amount in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (A) the number of vested
Company Shares subject to such Performance Share Award (after taking into
account any vesting that occurs in connection with the preceding sentence) and
(B) the Cash Merger Consideration; (ii) in the event that the Entire Casa Ley
Sale has not been consummated prior to the Effective Time, one Casa Ley CVR
in respect of each vested Company Share subject to such Performance Share
Award; and (iii) in the event that the Entire PDC Sale has not been
consummated prior to the Effective Time, one PDC CVR in respect of each vested
Company Share subject to such Performance Share Award.

restricted stock unit covering Company Shares (each, a " _Company RSU_ "),
that was granted under any Company Equity Incentive Plan, whether or not then
vested, shall be accelerated, vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each former holder of any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company RSU and in
settlement therefor, (i) an amount in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (A) the number of vested Company
Shares subject to such Company RSU and (B) the Cash Merger Consideration; (ii)
in the event that the Entire Casa Ley Sale has not been consummated prior to
the Effective Time, one Casa Ley CVR in respect of each vested Company Share
subject to such Company RSU; and (iii) in the event that the Entire

in respect of each vested Company Share subject to such Company RSU.

Effective Time, all shares credited in the "stock credit accounts" under the
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (" _DCP_ ") and the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Directors II (" _DCPII_ ") shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, such accounts shall be credited with (i) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares credited to each such
"stock credit account" and (B) the Cash Merger Consideration; (ii) in the
event that the Entire PDC Sale has not been consummated prior to the
Effective Time, one PDC CVR in respect of each Company Share credited to each
such "stock credit account"; and (iii) in the event that the Entire Casa Ley
Sale has not been consummated prior to the Effective Time, one Casa Ley CVR
in respect of each Company Share credited to each such "stock credit account".
All amounts credited under the DCP and the DCPII shall be continue to be held
and paid at such times and in accordance with the terms of the plans and any
deferral and distribution elections made thereunder.

(g) _Company Board Resolutions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions the Company Board deems necessary and
appropriate to effect the provisions of this _Section 2.4_. 

(h) _Blackhawk Adjustment_. Upon the consummation of the Blackhawk Spin-Off
prior to Closing, the Company agrees that (i) each Company Option shall be
adjusted such that the exercise price per Company Share of each Company Option
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the fair market value of the Blackhawk
capital stock distributed to each Company Share, imputed from the closing
price of Blackhawk on the date of the consummation of the Blackhawk Spin-Off
(the "Blackhawk Spin-Off Imputed Value"); (ii) each Company RSU shall be
adjusted such that the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company
RSU shall be increased by a number of Company Shares equal to the product of
the Blackhawk Spin-Off Imputed Value and the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the adjustment for the Blackhawk
Spin-Off, divided by the closing price of the Company Shares on the date of
the consummation of the Blackhawk Spin-Off; and (iii) each Performance Share
Award shall be adjusted such that the Target Number of Performance Shares (as
defined under the applicable Performance Share Award) subject to such
Performance Share Award shall be increased by a number of Company Shares equal
to the product of the Blackhawk Spin-Off Imputed Value and the number of
Company Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
adjustment for the Blackhawk Spin-Off, divided by the closing price of the
Company Shares on the date of the consummation of the Blackhawk Spin-Off.

to the Company is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all Company
Permits except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, or the failure to be in full force and effect of, any of the Company

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, all Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") (such documents and
any other documents filed by the Company with the SEC since January 2, 2011
and those filed or furnished through the date of this Agreement,
collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective filing
dates or, if supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing and
prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the most recent supplement,
modification or

 



15  amendment, the Company SEC Reports (i) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company.

 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in
the Company SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published Laws of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal and
recurring year-end adjustments, the absence of footnote disclosures and as may
be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or like form
under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (except, in the case of
interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end adjustments,
the absence of footnote disclosures and as may be permitted by the SEC on
Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or like form under the Exchange Act).
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements of any type required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have not been so
described in the Company SEC Reports filed on or after January 2, 2011 and
prior to the date hereof nor any obligations to enter into any such
arrangements.

 

(c) _Section 3.6(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof, of all letters of credit, surety bonds

(d) The information to be supplied by the Company for inclusion in the proxy
statement to be filed with the SEC and sent to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Stockholders Meeting (as amended or
supplemented from time to time and including any document incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") shall not, on the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or on any other date
of filing with the SEC, or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain
any statement that, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which
it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein not false or misleading in light of the circumstances under which
they were or shall be made, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders Meeting that has become false or
misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable thereto as of
the date of such filing with the SEC. If at any time before the Stockholders
Meeting any fact or event relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that is required by applicable Law to be set forth in an

 



16  amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement should be discovered by the
Company or should, to the Companys Knowledge, occur, the Company shall,
promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform Ultimate Parent of such fact or
event.

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 of the
Exchange Act) required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are, as determined by the Company upon an
assessment of the effectiveness of such controls as of December 28, 2013,
effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in the reports that the Company files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 2, 2011, subject to any
applicable grace periods, the Company and each of its officers and directors
have been in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
listing and other rules and regulations of the NYSE and (ii) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section 3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in the Companys financial statements as of and for the period ended
December 28, 2013 (as amended or restated, if applicable, prior to the date
hereof) or the notes thereto included in the Companys annual report on Form
10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2014, (b) for liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 28,
2013, (c) for liabilities incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with this Agreement, (d) for liabilities or obligations that have
been discharged or paid in full or (e) liabilities under any Contract to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary may be bound (other than any such liability or
obligation resulting from a breach or a default thereunder), neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature that would be required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, other
than those which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since December 28, 2013, no event has occurred that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Company Disclosure Schedule, since December 28, 2013 through and including
the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any

 



17  action that would have been prohibited by subsections (i) through (xix) of
_Section 5.1_ hereof if such action were taken after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. 

Section 3.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 3.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended and including the regulations promulgated thereunder (" _ERISA_ "),
including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA, as well as each material employee benefit or
compensation plan, arrangement or agreement and each material employment,
consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, equity-
based, severance, termination, retention, change-in-control, profit-sharing,
material fringe benefit, health, welfare, death or disability benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement for the benefit of any current, former or
retired employee, service provider or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary entered into, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
obligated to contribute or has any liability (such plans, programs,
agreements, arrangements and commitments, collectively, the " _Company Benefit
Plans_ "). Other than the Company Subsidiaries and the Excluded Entities,
there are no other entities that together with the Company would be treated
as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each
such entity, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").

 

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, the Company has made available to Ultimate Parent true,
complete and correct copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written
document evidencing such Company Benefit Plan, including all amendments
thereto; (ii) any summary plan description and summaries of
material modifications to any Company Benefit Plan; (iii) any related trust
agreements, insurance Contracts or documents of any other funding
arrangements; (iv) the two most recent actuarial reports and financial
statements, if any are required by applicable Law; (v) with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" under Section 401(a) of the
Code, the most recent determination or opinion letter from the IRS; and (vi)
the two most recent Forms 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS,
including all schedules thereto.

(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect:

 

(i) each Company Benefit Plan is and has been established, in compliance with
and administered in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Laws and in all material respects in accordance with its governing documents;

(ii) no claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action is pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, is threatened against any of the Company Benefit Plans
(other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), any
trustee or fiduciaries thereof, the Company (including any Company
Subsidiary), any director, officer or employee thereof, or any of the assets
of any trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans;

 



18 (iii) all contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their
due dates under applicable Law and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan; and

 

(iv) all obligations of the Company and each Company Subsidiary under each
Company Benefit Plan, whether arising by operation of Law or by contract,
required to be performed under Section 4980B of the Code, as amended ("
_COBRA_ ") or similar state Law have been timely performed in all material
respects.

 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS to such effect, or has pending or has time remaining in which to
file an application for such determination from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation of any such letter.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and the
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
has failed to meet such minimum funding standards or otherwise failed to
materially comply with Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. The
Company has not incurred any material liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") (other than PBGC premiums, which have
been paid when due) or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA or under the Code
that has not been satisfied in full. As of the date of this Agreement, no
written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral communication has been
received from the PBGC in respect of any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA concerning the funded status of such Company Benefit Plan or any
transfer of assets and liabilities from such Company Benefit Plan in
connection with the transactions on or prior to the Effective Time
contemplated herein, and no administrative investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding by the U.S. Department of Labor, the PBGC, the IRS
or any other Governmental Entity is pending or in progress, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than any routine requests for information
from the PBGC).

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(f)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
any Excluded Entity or any ERISA Affiliate has within the last six years (i)
contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to any multiemployer plan or
(ii) incurred any withdrawal liability from any multiemployer plan. Except as
set forth on _Section 3.9(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the fair
market value of the assets held under each Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than any multiemployer plan) is
sufficient so as to permit a "standard termination" of each such plan under
Section 4041(b) of ERISA without the need to make any additional contributions
to such plan.

 

(g) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on
_Section 3.9(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution
or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated on or prior to the Effective Time by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any material 

 



19  payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) materially increase the amount or value of any
benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any
such employee, director or consultant, or (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation.

(h) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to the Company, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
trustee or administrator of any Company Benefit Plan, has engaged in a
nonexempt "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and
Section 406 of ERISA.

 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Benefit Plan that constitutes a "non-
qualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code has been operated in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and (ii) no Company Benefit Plan
provides for the gross-up of any Person with respect to any failure to comply
with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(j) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) provides health
or welfare benefits for any retired or former employee or (ii) is obligated to
provide health or welfare benefits to any active employees after their
retirement or other termination of service, unless required to do so under
COBRA or any similar applicable Law.

(k) Except as set forth on _Section 3.9(k)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or
the vesting of property) by any current or former employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan as a result of the
consummation of the Merger would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G
of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code.

 

(l) _Section 3.9(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each material Company Benefit Plan which is
maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any
employee residing or working outside the United States (any such Company
Benefit Plan set forth in _Section 3.9(l)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "). With respect to each
Foreign Benefit Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) such Foreign Benefit Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and all
applicable Law of any controlling Governmental Entity; and (ii) any such
Foreign Benefit Plan that is required to be funded and/or book reserved is so
funded and/or book reserved, as reflected on the financial statements of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary (as applicable) in accordance with applicable
accounting standards and based on reasonable actuarial assumptions (if any),
to the extent required to be reflected in such financial statements.

Section 3.10 _Labor Matters_.

 

(a) Except as listed on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
(i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective

 



20  bargaining, labor union or similar agreement and (ii) there are no
collective bargaining, labor union or similar agreements which cover employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable Laws relating to labor and
employment, including those relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining,
unemployment compensation, workers compensation, equal
employment opportunity, age and disability discrimination, immigration
control, employee classification, information privacy and security, payment
and withholding of Taxes and continuation coverage with respect to group

threatened, labor disputes, work stoppages, labor strikes or lockouts against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary by employees and there are no
complaints, charges, or claims against the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
threatened in writing to be brought or filed, with any Governmental Entity
based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment or termination of employment of any individual by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, in each case, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, except as would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no (i) unfair labor
practice charges or complaints against the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pending before the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
such representations, claims or petitions are threatened, (ii) representation
claims or petitions pending before the National Labor Relations Board or any
other labor relations tribunal or authority or (iii) grievances or pending
arbitration proceedings against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
arose out of or under any collective bargaining agreement.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the independent contractors who provide, or provided,
services to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, or were, properly
classified as independent contractors in all material respects, no
independent contractor can reasonably claim that he or she has any right to
participate in the Company Benefit Plans and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
neither the Company or any Company Subsidiary is under investigation or audit
with respect to its treatment as independent contractors rather than
employees.

Section 3.11  _Contracts_.

the Company and any Company Subsidiary party thereto on no more than 90 days
notice without material liability or

 



22  material financial obligation to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,

Company has made available to Ultimate Parent or its respective
Representatives prior to the date hereof a complete and accurate copy of each
Company Material Contract, as amended or modified prior to the date hereof,
subject in each case to redactions reasonably necessary in the good faith
judgment of the Company and its inside and outside legal counsel to comply
with applicable Antitrust Laws or other Laws or confidentiality provisions
relating to such Company Material Contracts.

 

(b) Each Company Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any counterparty thereto, and is in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, on the one
hand, nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any other party to any Company Material
Contract, on the other hand, is in violation of or in default under (nor does
there exist any condition that, upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company
Material Contract, which violation or default would reasonably be expected to

Effect. Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would

transaction, or series of related transactions, or understanding
after January 2, 2011 and prior to the date hereof, nor are there as of the
date hereof any currently proposed transactions, or series of related
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, in each case, that
would be subject to disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K that
has not been disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to
the date hereof.

 

Section 3.12 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral, governmental, regulatory or other proceedings,
claims, actions, suits, governmental or regulatory investigations or

would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) There is no order, injunction, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction
(other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated
companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



23 Section 3.13 _Tangible Assets / Real Property_.

 

(a) Except for the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property and except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company or one of its Company
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or in the case of leased tangible
assets, a valid leasehold interest in, all of its tangible assets, free and
clear of all mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens, charges or
encumbrances (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than (i) Liens for current
Taxes and assessments not yet past due or the amount or validity of which is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
appropriate reserves have been made in accordance with GAAP; (ii) mechanics,
workmens, repairmens, warehousemens and carriers Liens arising in the
ordinary course of businesses of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) Liens securing rental payments under
capital leases agreements; (iv) Liens and restrictions on real property
(including easements, covenants, rights of way and similar restrictions) that
(A) are matters of record, (B) would be disclosed by a current, accurate
survey or physical inspection of such real property, (C) do not materially
interfere with the present uses of such real property or (D) with respect to
Leased Real Property, have been created by or through an owner of the Leased
Real Property; (v) Liens constituting a written lease, sublease or occupancy
agreement that gives any third party any right to occupy any real property;
(vi) other Liens arising in the ordinary course of business and not incurred
in connection with the borrowing of money; and (vii) Liens arising under any
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Permitted Liens_
").

(b)  _Section 3.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Material Owned Real Property and all Material Leased
Real Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has (i) good and marketable title in
fee simple to all Owned Real Property and (ii) good and marketable leasehold
title to all Leased Real Property, in each case, free and clear of all Liens
except Permitted Liens. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no parcel
of Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property is subject to any governmental
decree or order to be sold or is being condemned, expropriated or otherwise
taken by any Governmental Entity with or without payment of compensation
therefor, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any such condemnation,
expropriation or taking been proposed. Each of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases,
except for any such failure to do so that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All leases of Leased Real Property and all amendments and modifications
thereto are in full force and effect, and there exists no material default
under any such lease by the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or any other
party thereto, nor has any event occurred that, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a material default thereunder by the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any other party thereto, except as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no contractual or
legal restrictions that

 



24  preclude or restrict the ability to use any Owned Real Property or Leased
Real Property by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the current or
contemplated use of such real property. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, all plants, warehouses, distribution centers, structures and other
buildings on the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property are adequately
maintained and are in good operating condition and repair for the requirements
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently
conducted and are sufficient to permit the Company and the Company

Section 4.6 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly by Parent. There are no
options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to
which Merger Sub is a party relating to the issued or unissued Equity
Interests in Merger Sub or obligating Merger Sub to grant, issue or sell
any shares of the capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in Merger Sub,
by sale or otherwise. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of

capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no
other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.7 _Broker s Fees_. None of the Parent Entities nor any of their
respective Affiliates has employed any investment banker, broker or finder or

expense reimbursement in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary would be liable.

Section 4.8 _Ownership of Company Securities_. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Parent Entities and their Subsidiaries do not
beneficially own (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any Company Shares or other securities of the Company or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Shares or other
securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities
or otherwise) in, the Company. Other than as contemplated by this Agreement,
none of the Parent Entities is, nor at any time during the last three years
has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company within the meaning of
Section 203 of the DGCL.

 

Section 4.9 _Agreements with Company Stockholders, Directors, Officers and
Employees_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Parent Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract, or has made or
entered into any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings
(whether or not binding), with any beneficial owner of more than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding Company Shares (excluding sources of debt
financing in their capacities as such), pursuant to which such holder would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the Per
Share Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any such holder agrees to
vote to adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger or with any director or
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries that in any way relates to
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the post-
Closing operation of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.10 _Available Funds; Financing_.

(a) Ultimate Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete
copy of each of the executed Debt Commitment Letters and Equity Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date hereof. As of the date hereof, (i) none of
the Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or modified in any
manner; (ii) the respective commitments contained in 

 



35  the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any
respect, and (iii) the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and
represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent, Merger Sub
and, to the Knowledge of Ultimate Parent, each other party thereto, including
of the Financing Sources to provide the Financing contemplated thereby,
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and,
subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application
relating to or affecting rights of creditors. None of the Parent Entities nor
any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter
or other arrangement relating to the financing of the Closing Date Payments or
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than (A) the Commitment
Letters and (B) the fee letters related to the Debt Financing (true, correct
and complete copies of each of which fee letters have been provided to the
Company prior to the date hereof, subject only to redactions to exclude any
fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the market flex
and other economic terms that could not adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Debt Financing). The net proceeds of the Financing
together with the aggregate cash on hand of the Company, the Parent Entities
and their respective Subsidiaries (both before and after giving effect to the
exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions related thereto) will be
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
making of all Closing Date Payments on the Closing Date. The Parent Entities
have fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and
other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, to the Knowledge of
Ultimate Parent, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default
under any of the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, none of the Parent
Entities nor any of their Affiliates has any reason to believe that, assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_, any Financing Conditions will not be satisfied as of the Closing Date or
that the Financing will not be made available to the Parent Entities on the
Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section 7.2(c)_, each of the Parent Entities and Merger
Sub understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, its
obligation to consummate the Merger is not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to consummation of the Financing, the transactions
contemplated by the EDS APA or any other financing arrangements, obtaining
the Financing or any other financing or the availability, grant, provision or
extension of the Financing or any other financing to the Parent Entities or
any other Person; _provided_ , that it is hereby acknowledged and agreed by
the Company that nothing in this _Section 4.10(b)_ shall modify the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.13_, including as to the ability to
obtain the remedy of specific performance in respect of the Financing.

 

Section 4.11 _Solvency_. Immediately following the Effective Time, and after
giving effect to any change in the assets and liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Financing, the Surviving Corporation will (a)
be able to pay its debts as they become due and will own property having a
fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all its contingent
liabilities); and (b) have adequate capital

 



36  to carry on its businesses, in each case, assuming (i) satisfaction of the
conditions to the Parent Entities obligation to consummate the Merger as set
forth herein, (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the Required Information fairly presents
the consolidated financial condition of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated
results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods covered thereby and (iv) any estimates, projections or forecasts of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith
based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
present or future creditors of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 4.12 _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Each of the Parent Entities
acknowledges and agrees that it and its Representatives (a) have had an
opportunity to discuss the business and affairs of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries with the management of the Company, (b) have had reasonable
access to the books and records of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
(including pursuant to the electronic data room maintained by the Company),
(c) have been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers
from officers of the Company and (d) have conducted their own independent
investigation of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, their respective
businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any
representation, warranty or other statement by any Person on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article III_ of this
Agreement and that all other representations and warranties, including any
implied warranties, are specifically disclaimed. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Parent Entities further acknowledges and agrees that
none of the Company or any of its stockholders, Affiliates or Representatives
has made any representation or warranty concerning any estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans or other forward-looking information
regarding the Company, Company Subsidiaries or their respective businesses and
operations. Each of the Parent Entities hereby acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to develop such estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information
with which the Parent Entities are familiar, that the Parent Entities are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and
other forward-looking information furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information), and that the
Parent Entities will have no claim against the Company or any of its
stockholders, Affiliates or Representatives with respect thereto.

the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing not being consummated on the
Closing Date. The Company may provide Parent with a written notice indicating
that is has complied with the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.2_ with
respect to the Required Information and the Marketing Materials, which shall
be deemed accepted and agreed to by Parent unless Parent shall object to such
determination in writing within two (2) Business Days from receipt of such
notice, which objection shall specifically identify the reasons it believes
that the Company has not satisfied such obligations under this _Section 5.2_.

 

(c) Following termination of this Agreement in circumstances in which the
Parent Termination Fee is not payable, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any damages, liability or obligation suffered
or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent
such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Parent shall,
promptly upon the Companys request, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company and Company Subsidiaries (and its and their
respective Representatives) in connection with their cooperation and
assistance obligations set forth in this _Section 5.2_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed:

 



44 (i) the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.2_ shall not require the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of its or their respective
Representatives to execute any Debt Financing Document or agree to any
obligation relating to the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing that is not
conditioned upon the Closing and that does not terminate without liability to
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, and any of its and their respective
Representatives upon the termination of this Agreement;

 

(ii) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective Representatives shall be required to undertake any action that
would unreasonably interfere with the business operations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary;

 

(iii) the Company shall not be required to take any action to the extent it
could cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached
or become inaccurate, cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article
VI_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement;

 

(iv) none of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates,
Representatives or financing sources shall have the right to perform any
investigative procedures that involve physical disturbance or damage to any
property or other assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary;

 

(v) the Company shall have a reasonable opportunity to (but shall not be
required to) review and propose comments on Marketing Materials containing
information about the Company prior to the dissemination of such materials to
potential lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing
transaction (or filing with any Governmental Entity);

 

(vi) except to the extent disclosed to Debt Financing Sources and other
potential sources of capital, rating agencies and prospective investors
during the marketing or syndication of the Debt Financing (including any
offering or private placement memoranda) in a manner that requires the
recipient of such information to agree to customary confidentiality
obligations (including customary "click through" confidentiality agreements),
all non-public information regarding the Company obtained by the Parent
Entities, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or Representatives shall be
kept confidential to the extent required by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement;

(vii) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their
respective Representatives shall be required to deliver or cause the delivery
of any legal opinions, negative assurance letters, or accountants comfort
letters and reliance letters, confirmations, authorization letters,
undertakings, or third party reports in connection with the Debt Financing,
in each case, without limiting the obligation of the Company pursuant to
_Section 5.2(a)(ii)_ to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
customary comfort letters and consents of independent accountants with
respect to Required Information included in the Marketing Materials as set
forth above;

 



45 (viii) the Companys obligations shall not include any actions that
the Company reasonably believes would result in (A) a violation of any
material agreement, any confidentiality arrangement or any applicable Law, (B)
the loss of any legal or other applicable privilege or (C) the triggering of
a disclosure obligation, including with respect to material non public
information concerning the Company;

(ix) any lender meetings, investor meetings, road shows, rating agency
presentations or similar events shall be at mutually agreeable times and
locations; and

 

(x) the public filing of the Companys annual, quarterly and current reports
that are required to be filed pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Act shall
constitute the furnishing and delivery of the Required Information contained
therein to Parent and its Debt Financing Sources, and Parent shall be deemed
to have such reports and such Required Information.

 

The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt by the Company of a
written request by Parent (and a reasonable period of time in advance of the
anticipated Closing Date, as reasonably determined by Parent), the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with an offer to purchase
by Parent or one of its Affiliates and any related consent solicitation
with respect to one or more series of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the then-outstanding Specified Company Notes on the terms and
conditions as are reasonably requested by Parent (including amendments to the
terms and provisions of the Indenture as reasonably requested by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) (including the related consent
solicitation, collectively the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") (and in any event so
as to accommodate the Debt Financing) and Parent shall assist the Company in
connection therewith. Promptly upon the consummation of the Merger and the
expiration date (as such date may be extended from time to time) of any such
consent solicitation, assuming the requisite consents are received, the
Company shall execute, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Trustee (as defined below) to execute, a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture, by and between the Company and the Trustee, effectuating the
amendments for which consents were obtained pursuant to the Debt Tender
Offer, which supplemental indenture shall become effective immediately upon
the later of (i) acceptance for purchase of Specified Company Notes properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer and (ii) the
Effective Time. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer (including in
connection with delivery of Officers Certificates and Opinions of Counsel
(as such terms are defined in the Indenture) required under the Indenture;
_provide_ d such Officers Certificates and Opinions of Counsel are delivered
following consummation of the Merger). The closing of the Debt Tender Offer
shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and, without modifying
the applicable obligations of the Parties under this _Section 5.2_, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt
Tender Offer to close on the Closing Date (including by making public
announcements extending the expiration date of the Debt Tender Offer as

 



46  requested by Parent and by the Company otherwise complying with the time
periods required by Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act). Unless otherwise
agreed by Parent, promptly following the Effective Time, and in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the Person making the offer for the
Specified Company Notes shall accept for purchase and purchase the Specified
Company Notes (including any premium thereon and any consent payments
applicable thereto) properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt
Tender Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.2_, the Debt Tender Offer need not
be consummated unless the Merger has occurred, and sufficient funds are
available from the Financing, together with the aggregate cash on hand of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to pay all consideration for the
purchase of the Specified Company Notes. Parent shall promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them of
any type in connection with the Debt Tender Offer (except to the extent such
losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses result from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective Representatives), and the foregoing obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

(f) If the required consents have not been received in the Debt Tender Offer,
or are not reasonably likely to be received, in each case, at least ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (with the number of Business Days
calculated in accordance with Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act), or if Parent
determines not to request the commencement of the Debt Tender Offer, then at
Parents written request, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly take all actions necessary and required to assist other
Parties in effecting the satisfaction and discharge of the Specified Company
Notes pursuant to Article VIII of the Indenture, which satisfaction and
discharge shall be effective upon consummation of the Merger, and the Company
shall, contemporaneously with the consummation of the Merger, assist other
Parties in (i) giving irrevocable instructions to mail a notice of redemption
to holders of the Specified Company Notes pursuant to Section 3.3 of the
Indenture, (ii) depositing in trust all required funds or Government
Securities (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to such satisfaction and
discharge as set forth in Section 3.5 of the Indenture and (iii) paying or
causing to be paid all other sums payable pursuant to the Indenture, and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other Parties
in causing the Trustee to acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture in writing and shall furnish a copy of such writing to
Parent concurrently with the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action described in
this _Section 5.2(f)_ unless the Company shall have received from Parent
funds which, together with the aggregate cash on hand of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, are equal to the amounts required to be deposited with
the Trustee to pay the redemption price for the Specified Company Notes as
required pursuant to Section 3.5 of the Indenture and pay or cause to be paid
all other sums payable pursuant to the Indenture in connection therewith.

 

Section 5.3 _Parent s Financing Covenant_.

 

.

 



47 (a) The Parent Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, on or prior to the Closing Date,
the Financing, including the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms set forth therein, including the following:

(i) complying with and maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters;

 

(ii) negotiating and entering into definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto),
as amended from time to time in accordance with this _Section 5.3_ so that
such agreements are in full force and effect on the Closing Date;

(iii) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions within its
reasonable control or that require its cooperation ( _provided_ that this
clause (iii) shall not require Parent to waive any of its conditions to
Closing in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ of this Agreement); and

 

(iv) in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ and the Debt Financing Conditions (other than the availability of the
Equity Financing) have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding and at
Closing would be satisfied, using reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing, including by
pursuing any and all available remedies (including specific performance or
other equitable or injunctive relief) against the Debt Financing Sources.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall take any
action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that a Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent shall

 

(i) immediately notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the
reasons therefor,

 

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from
alternative financing sources (on aggregate terms not materially less
favorable to Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and which do not include any
conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are
more onerous than those in the Debt Commitment Letters and which do not
contain any conditions that, when considered with the other conditions taken
as a whole, would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
availability of the Debt Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability
or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or make the satisfaction of the Financing less
likely to occur), in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the
remaining portion of the Debt Financing and the aggregate cash on hand of the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, to pay any amounts required
to be paid by or on behalf of Parent in connection with the Closing and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this 

 



48  Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
Financing Failure Event and in any event no later than the date on which the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to  _Section 1.3_ (any such financing,
an " _Alternative Financing_ "), and

(iii) obtain and, when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company,
except for substitutions or replacements pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_ in
connection with an Alternative Financing, Parent shall not (A) agree to, or
permit, any amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, assignment,
substitution, replacement or waiver of or under, the Debt Commitment Letters,
if such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement, assignment,
substitution, replacement or waiver (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing that, when
considered with the other Debt Financing Conditions taken as a whole, would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the
Debt Financing or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or make the satisfaction of the Debt Financing Conditions
less likely to occur; (2) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing; (3)
adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, modified, supplemented,
restated, assigned, substituted, replaced or waived, relative to the ability
of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof; or (4) would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make the satisfaction of
the Debt Financing Conditions less likely to occur; or (B) terminate any Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ that during the first 30 days following the date
of this Agreement, Parent shall have the right to release or consent to
assignments and replacements of an individual lender pursuant to the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letters in effect on the date of this Agreement in
connection with the addition of a commitment party thereunder that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Upon any such amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement, assignment, substitution, replacement or waiver of
the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with this _Section 5.3_, the term
"Debt Commitment Letters" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letters as so
amended, modified, supplemented, restated, assigned, substituted, replaced or
waived.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, "reasonable
best efforts" shall not require the Parent Entities to (i) pay (or agree to
pay) more, in the aggregate, for the Debt Financing (whether in interest rate,
fees or otherwise) than as contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters and any
fee letter entered into by the Parent Entities in connection therewith
(including after giving effect to any increase in interest rate, fees or
otherwise resulting from any "market flex" provisions contained in such fee
letter) or otherwise agree to any Alternative Financing other than as
required pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, (ii) seek more capital in the
aggregate than is committed in the Equity Commitment Letters or (iii) waive
any condition or agree to any changes to the Commitment Letters.

 



49 (e) Parent shall prepare and provide to its Debt Financing Sources the
information and documents described in paragraphs 11 and 12 of Exhibit D to
the Debt Commitment Letter (or any similar conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Documents) by such date as is necessary to permit the Debt Financing
Conditions set forth in such paragraphs to be satisfied on or prior to
December 19, 2014; provided that Parent shall not be in breach of its
obligations under this sentence if (a) such Debt Financing Conditions are not
satisfied on or prior to such date as the result of the failure by the
Company to deliver the Required Information or to cause Parent to have the
Required Information throughout the applicable period on or prior to December
19, 2014 or (b) the Debt Financing is not in fact syndicated or placed on
or prior to such date.

Section 5.4 _Casa Ley Sale; PDC Sale_.

 

(a) In the event a definitive agreement is to be entered into prior to the
Effective Time with respect to the Entire Casa Ley Sale, one or more Partial
Casa Ley Sales, the Entire PDC Sale or one or more Partial PDC Sales, such
agreement shall not, without the consent of Ultimate Parent (which such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (A)
require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to agree to any material
financial or operating restrictions applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary after the Effective Time (other than customary (1) confidentiality
and/or employee non-solicitation restrictions that survive for no more than
two (2) years from and after the Effective Time, (2) to the extent such
restrictions are reasonable, restrictions relating to the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys management or oversight of Casa Ley, any of its
Subsidiaries, PDC, or any of their respective businesses, properties or assets
or any portions thereof and (3) restrictions contained in the PDC Lease
Agreements), (B) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to agree to
any recourse applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the
closing of such agreement in excess of any escrow amount, holdback or similar
amount after the closing of such agreement other than with respect to any
customary indemnity obligations (which customary indemnity obligations, in the
case of an Entire Casa Ley Sale or Partial Casa Ley Sale, are shared
proportionately (based on their respective Equity Interests) among all of
the participating Casa Ley shareholders) for (1) any breaches by the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries of (x) its covenants or agreements contained in
such agreement or (y) any customary representations in such agreement relating
to organization, qualification, capitalization, title to assets, authority,
no conflicts, brokers, taxes, employee benefits or (with respect to PDC only)
environmental matters, or (2) pre-closing taxes relating to Casa Ley, any of
its Subsidiaries, PDC or any of their respective businesses, properties or
assets or any portions thereof prior to the closing of such agreement, (C)
require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to retain any material excluded
or retained liabilities (other than in connection with the matters described
in (B) above) relating to the securities or assets of Casa Ley, any of its
Subsidiaries or PDC being directly or indirectly sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of in connection with such sale after the closing of such
agreement or (D) be sold for a price that is payable in consideration other
than cash or that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, would cause the
Net Casa Ley Proceeds, the Partial Net Casa Ley Proceeds, the PDC Net
Proceeds or the Partial PDC Net Proceeds from such sale agreement to be (1)
after also satisfying the repayment obligations contemplated by the following
clauses (2) and (3), less than zero, (2) in the case of an Entire PDC Sale,
be insufficient to repay in full all amounts remaining outstanding under the
Company-PDC Loans and (3) in the case of a Partial PDC Sale, less than the PDC
Loan Mandatory 

 



50  Prepayment Amount applicable to such Partial PDC Sale. For the avoidance of
doubt, and notwithstanding anything in any definitive agreement with respect
to the Entire Casa Ley Sale, one or more Partial Casa Ley Sales, the Entire
PDC Sale or one or more Partial PDC Sales, the Shareholder Representative (as
defined in the PDC CVR Agreement or Casa Ley CVR Agreement) shall control any
third party claims relating to or arising under any such definitive agreement
to the extent that any damages claimed thereunder are reasonably likely to be
covered in full by any escrow, holdback or similar amount thereunder, and any
costs, fees or expenses incurred by such Shareholder Representative
in connection therewith shall be included in Casa Ley Sale Expenses or PDC
Sale Expenses, as applicable. If, in connection with any Entire PDC Sale or
Partial PDC Sale which includes employees of PDC, if so requested by the
purchaser, the Company shall provide personnel transition services to such
purchaser for no more than six (6) months and at no additional cost to the
Company, pursuant to a transition services agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, (A) the Company shall contribute to
PDC (1) the Contributed Stores Real Estate, the Contributed Stores Centers,
the Development Stores Real Estate, the Development Stores Centers, the
Additional PDC Real Estate and all other assets, rights, privileges,
entitlements, contracts and agreements related to the ownership and
development of the Contributed Stores Real Estate, the Contributed Stores
Centers, the Development Stores Real Estate, the Development Stores Centers
and the Additional PDC Real Estate and all personal property used in
connection with the business of PDC (including, without limitation,
equipment, plans and specifications, contracts, reports and other data and
presentation and marketing materials), to the extent that the same are not
already owned by PDC, in each case except for the Cannery Mall, Lahaina, HI
property referenced in clause (2) below, free and clear of all monetary liens
and encumbrances and (2) cash in an amount equal to Forty Million Dollars
($40,000,000), which amount shall be held by PDC in a reserve account
until the earlier to occur of (i) payment in full of the mortgage
indebtedness currently encumbering the Contributed Stores Center commonly
known as Cannery Mall, Lahaina, HI (Safeway Property Number 1222) and (ii) the
release of the Company from any guaranty obligations in connection with such
indebtedness, and thereafter, such contributed cash (or the remaining portion
thereof) may be used by PDC in the ordinary course of its business, (B) the
Company and PDC shall execute and deliver a lease agreement with respect to
each of the Contributed Stores and the Development Stores, pursuant to which
the Company shall lease each Contributed Store and Development Store from PDC
at the applicable rental rates set forth on  _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (as may be adjusted with respect to Development Stores as
provided herein), which agreement shall be substantially in the form set forth
in _Exhibit F_ (each such agreement, a " _PDC Lease Agreement_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company and PDC shall cooperate to make reasonable
changes and additions to the PDC Lease Agreement (i) to address site-specific
conditions and issues, (ii) to contemplate customary provisions and
requirements of a build-to-suit lease agreement for any property being
developed or redeveloped (or which will be developed or redeveloped) by PDC,
and (iii) as may be reasonably required by an institutional purchaser of the
Contributed Stores or Development Stores to reflect current market terms,
_provided_ such changes to the PDC Lease Agreement permitted above shall not
in any material respect (1) affect the economic terms of the PDC Lease
Agreement, except to the extent expressly provided herein, (2) change the
primary term or number or length of options of the PDC Lease Agreement or (3)
change the tenants ability to assign or sublet in the PDC Lease Agreement,
(C) the Company and PDC shall enter into ground leases for fuel centers to be

 



51  operated by the Company in connection with the applicable Contributed Stores
or Development Stores at the applicable ground rental rates set forth on
_Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (D) the Company and
PDC shall enter into such contracts and agreements contemplated by or
reasonably required to effectuate the PDC Restructuring. With respect to the
foregoing clause (D), the Company and Ultimate Parent shall work together in
good faith to identify the assets of PDC that are required to be transferred
to the Company or a Company Subsidiary in connection with the PDC
Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rents set
forth in _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule for the
Development Stores are based on the assumed construction costs and store areas
set forth in _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
are subject to adjustment up or down based upon actual as built store areas
and final construction costs of any Development Store. Such adjustment will be
based on a seven percent (7%) capitalization factor, to the end that each
$1,000 of cost increase or decrease in actual construction costs from the
applicable assumed construction costs for any Development Store will result in
an increase or decrease of $70.00 in annual rental from the amount listed on
_Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company will have
the option to pay to PDC the amount of any such increase in the assumed
construction costs in cash, in lieu of a rent adjustment, and the Company also
will have the right to terminate the PDC Lease for any Development Store if
the rent applicable to such Development Store would increase the annual rent
per square foot amount stated in _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule by more than ten percent (10%), provided, further, that PDC will
have the right to override any such termination by the Company by agreeing to
bear the cost increase to the extent that it would result in a rent increase
of more than ten percent (10%) from the applicable annual rent per square
foot set forth on _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each
PDC Lease Agreement shall provide for the commencement of rent payable
thereunder on the date of the Entire PDC Sale or, if applicable, on the date
the applicable store leased pursuant thereto is sold as part of a Partial PDC
Sale; provided, however that with respect to any PDC Lease Agreement for a
Development Store, the rent thereunder shall commence on the later of (w) the
date PDC tenders possession of the applicable Development Store to the
Company and (x) the date of the Entire PDC Sale or, if applicable, on the date
the applicable store leased pursuant thereto is sold as part of a Partial PDC
Sale (unless such Development Store is subject to PDC Third Party
Indebtedness, in which case the PDC Lease Agreement shall provide for the
commencement of rent payable thereunder on the earlier of (y) ninety (90) days
after the date PDC tenders possession of the applicable Development Store to
the Company in accordance with such PDC Lease Agreement and (z) the date that
the Company opens for business in such Development Store).

 

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall extend the Company-
PDC Loans to PDC, the proceeds of which may be used by PDC in the ordinary
course of its business (including, without limitation, the funding of
development and redevelopment activity). The Company-PDC Loans shall be
disbursed from time to time as reasonably requested by PDC, shall be secured
by a Mortgage on the PDC Mortgaged Properties and shall not exceed Three
Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) in aggregate principal amount
(excluding the amount of any capitalized interest added to such principal
balance) which, for the avoidance of doubt, may not be re-borrowed upon any
repayment. Concurrently with the consummation of the Entire PDC Sale, PDC
shall repay all outstanding intercompany loans, liabilities or other
obligations to the Company or its Subsidiaries, including all
outstanding Company-PDC Loans. Concurrently with the consummation of one or
more Partial PDC Sales, PDC shall repay the

 



52  PDC Loan Mandatory Prepayment Amount applicable to such Partial PDC Sale.
All amounts received by PDC in connection with any Partial PDC Sales
(excluding the amounts required to repay the PDC Loan Mandatory Prepayment
Amount applicable to such Partial PDC Sale) may be used by PDC in the ordinary
course of its business (including, without limitation, the funding of
development and redevelopment activity) and any amounts so used or set aside
to be used shall not be Partial PDC Net Proceeds. Any decision to use such
amounts in the ordinary course of business, and not as a distribution to
holders of Company Shares, shall be made by the Company, if prior to the
Effective Time, and shall be made by the Shareholder Representative, if after
the Effective Time. Upon the repayment of the PDC Loan Mandatory Prepayment
Amount applicable to a Partial PDC Sale involving a PDC Mortgaged Property,
the corresponding Mortgage affecting such PDC Mortgaged Property shall be
released in full.

(d) In the event that the Entire Casa Ley Sale, the Entire PDC Sale, any
Partial Casa Ley Sale or any Partial PDC Sale is consummated prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall prepare and submit to Ultimate Parent, not
later than 20 Business Days following the day on which such sale is
consummated, or at such time as otherwise mutually agreed upon by Ultimate
Parent and the Company, a good faith written calculation, in reasonable
detail, certified by the chief financial officer of the Company, of (i) with
respect to the Entire Casa Ley Sale, the Casa Ley Sale Expenses and the Casa
Ley Net Proceeds, (ii) with respect to the Entire PDC Sale, the PDC Sale
Expenses and the PDC Net Proceeds, (iii) with respect to any Partial Casa Ley
Sale, the Casa Ley Sale Expenses and the Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds and
(iv) with respect to any Partial PDC Sale, the PDC Sale Expenses, the Company-
PDC Loans and the Partial PDC Net Proceeds. If reasonably requested by
Ultimate Parent, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 5
Business Days) furnish or cause to be furnished to Ultimate Parent and its
Representatives such work papers and other documents and information relating
to the calculations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.5(b)_ and _Section 5.8_, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws,
and NYSE rules to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment
or postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Stockholders Meeting (i) with the consent of Ultimate Parent, (ii) for the
absence of a quorum, (iii) after consultation with Ultimate Parent, to allow
reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which
the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) is reasonably necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting or (iv) after
consultation with Ultimate Parent, to allow additional solicitation of votes
in order to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section
5.8_, the Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and to
take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of the stockholders of the Company required by the Company
Certificate, the

 



53  Company Bylaws, the rules of the NYSE and the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to _Article VII_ (and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
in this _Section 5.5_ shall in any way affect the Companys termination
rights pursuant to _Article VII_ ), if the Company Board shall have made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall nonetheless submit
this Agreement to its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the
SEC. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Ultimate Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response. The Company (and
Ultimate Parent, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments
received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and shall
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after establishing the record date for the
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company shall be under no
obligation to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders prior to the No
Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall notify Ultimate Parent promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
and shall supply Ultimate Parent with copies of all material
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Ultimate
Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement, including furnishing as promptly as reasonably practicable to the
Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to it as may
be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law.

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any event or
circumstance relating to the Company, the Parent Entities, or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company or the Parent
Entities which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such Party shall
promptly inform the other Parties. If at any time before the Stockholders
Meeting, any such event or circumstance is discovered by the Company or the
Parent Entities, then in each case the Company shall, reasonably promptly
after becoming aware thereof, amend or supplement, as applicable, the Proxy
Statement to include disclosure of such fact or event. Each of the Parent
Entities and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading or
which omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 5.6 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to the immediately following
sentence, each of the Company and the Parent Entities shall use reasonable
best efforts to prevent the entry of (and, if entered, to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned) any injunction, order, ruling, decree,
judgment or similar order that results from any stockholder litigation
against the Company, the Parent Entities, Merger Sub, any of their Affiliates
or any of their respective

 



54  directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall give Ultimate Parent
the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its Affiliates or any of
their respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, with respect
to any settlement in connection therewith settled solely for monetary damages
not entirely paid for with proceeds of insurance (other than the deductible
under any insurance policy(ies) in effect as of the date hereof), no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Ultimate Parents prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each
of Ultimate Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly of
the commencement of any such stockholder or derivative suit, action,
litigation or claim of which it has received written notice related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Notifications_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws, prior to the earlier of Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall afford to the
Parent Entities and their respective Representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours to the Companys
officers, employees, properties, books, Contracts and records as the Parent
Entities may reasonably request; _provided_ , that (i) the Parent Entities
and their respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company, (ii) the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access
or information if the Company determines, in its good faith reasonable
judgment, that doing so would (A) violate applicable Law or a Contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, or (B) waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, (iii) the Company shall be
permitted to impose reasonable restrictions and requirements for safety
purposes, (iv) none of the Parent Entities, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, Representatives or financing sources shall have the right to
perform any investigative procedures that involve physical disturbance or
damage to any property or other assets of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and (v) no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein. Without limiting the generality of this _Section 5.7(a)_,
from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Ultimate Parent reasonably
promptly after becoming available, consolidated financial statements of the
Company including an unaudited balance sheet and income statement (but
excluding a statement of cash flow) for each four-week period measured by the
Company through the Closing Date as well as any update of its outlook for the
quarter or the balance of the fiscal year, in each case to the extent it may
prepare the same for managements internal use.

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated in circumstances where the
Parent Termination Fee is not payable, the Parent Entities jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives for any and all
claims arising out of any injuries or property damage arising out of the
access rights pursuant to this _Section 5.7_.

 



55 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, outside legal
counsel and financial advisors for each of the Company and the Parent
Entities shall be permitted to share with each other, for the purpose of the
Parties satisfaction of their respective obligations pursuant to _Section
5.9(a)_ in respect of Undertakings, any competitively sensitive information
relating to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Entities.

(d) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section 5.7(a)_,
the Parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 5, 2013, by and among the Company,
Cerberus Capital Management L.P., AB Acquisition LLC (as supplemented,
modified and amended from time to time (including pursuant to any joinders
executed in connection therewith), the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(e) During the period commencing upon the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all of the Parties and terminating upon the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, the Company shall promptly notify Ultimate
Parent, and Ultimate Parent shall promptly notify the Company, in writing of
any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_, as applicable, not
to be met. Each such notification shall include a certification of an officer
of the Company or Ultimate Parent, as applicable, that such notification is
being delivered in accordance with this _Section 5.7(e)_. No such
notification shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule or any disclosure of the Parent Entities for the purpose of (a)
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company or the Parent Entities in this Agreement; or (b) determining
whether any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_ or
_Section 6.3_ has been satisfied.

 

Section 5.8 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) Go-Shop Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on March 27, 2014 (the " _Go-Shop
Period_ ") the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to, directly and indirectly: (i)
initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposals or
offers that constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing
access to non-public information to any Person pursuant to confidentiality
agreements containing customary confidentiality terms which are not
materially more favorable in the aggregate to such Person than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ");  _provided_ , that the Company shall reasonably promptly (and,
in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) make available to Ultimate Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company or Company Subsidiaries that
the Company provides to any Person pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_ if such
information was not previously made available to Ultimate Parent, and (ii)
engage, enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Persons or groups of Persons with respect to any Acquisition
Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any
effort or _attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals._

 



56 (b) _No Shop_. Except as permitted by this _Section 5.8_ (including 
_Section 5.8(c)_, _Section 5.8(d)_ and _Section 5.8(e)_ and except as would
otherwise relate to any Excluded Party prior to the Excluded Party Deadline),
the Company shall, and shall direct the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to (i) at 12:00 AM on March 28, 2014 (the " _No Shop
Period Start Date_ ") immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and shall, if it has not already done so, promptly
require, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so, that each Person
(other than any Excluded Party) that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement prior to the date of this Agreement in connection
with its consideration of any Alternative Proposal return or destroy all
confidential information or data heretofore furnished to it by or on behalf of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (ii)
from the No Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, not (A)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any Acquisition
Proposal, (B) engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information concerning the
Company or Company Subsidiaries to, any Person that is seeking to make, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) providing for any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(c) _Permitted Conduct Following No Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time following the No Shop
Period Start Date and prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval
is obtained or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_
, if the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any Person that
did not result from a breach of _Section 5.8(a)_, subject to compliance with
this _Section 5.8(c)_, (i) the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may provide non-public information concerning the
Company and Company Subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such
Person if the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall reasonably
promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours) make available to
Ultimate Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or Company
Subsidiaries that the Company made available to any Person if such information
was not previously made available to Ultimate Parent, and (ii) the Company,
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), if the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company shall not provide any commercially
sensitive non-public information to any competitor in connection with this
_Section 5.8(c)_, other than in accordance with "clean room" or similar
procedures that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
Representatives are currently employing with respect to the sharing of any
such information to the Parent Entities. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the
No Shop Period Start Date, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described
in _Section 5.8(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party until 11:59 p.m. on
April 12, 2014 (the " _Excluded Party_  

 



57   _Deadline_ "), including with respect to any amended proposal submitted by
any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the
restrictions in Section 5.8(b) and this Section 5.8(c) shall not apply with
respect thereto until after the Excluded Party Deadline (and thereafter the
provisions of Section 5.8(b) and this Section 5.8(c) shall apply with respect
to such Excluded Party).

 

(d) _Termination for Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, if at any time prior to the time that
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not result from a material
breach of _Section 5.8(b)_ that the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this
Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company Board
may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ but only
if: (i) prior to taking any such action, the Company provides Ultimate Parent
with no fewer than three Business Days notice of any such proposed action,
attaching a copy of the Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy is
available, a description of such Superior Proposal), and during the three
Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with Ultimate Parent and its Representatives to the extent Ultimate
Parent wishes to negotiate and continues to negotiate in good faith during
such period regarding any such revisions to the terms of this Agreement
and the Commitment Letters and either (A) Ultimate Parent shall not have
irrevocably proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Commitment Letters prior to the end of such period or (B) if Ultimate
Parent within such period shall have proposed irrevocable revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Commitment Letters, the Company
Board, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Alternative
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal with respect to Ultimate Parents revised
proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement and accept such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that each time material
modifications to the financial terms of an Alternative Proposal determined to
be a Superior Proposal are made, the three Business Days time period shall
be extended for an additional two Business Days after notification of such
change to Ultimate Parent to the extent Ultimate Parent wishes to negotiate
and continues to negotiate in good faith during such period; (ii) prior to or
substantially simultaneously with such termination the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
and (iii) immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination the
Company shall have paid Ultimate Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 7.2(b)_.

(e) _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_. Subject to _Section 5.8(d)_ and
this _Section 5.8(e)_, the Company Board shall not make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, if at any time prior to the time that the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained, an Intervening Event shall have occurred, or an
Acquisition Proposal is received that the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel)
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal and, in each case, the Company Board determines
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change

 



58  would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless: (i) prior to taking any such action, the
Company provides Ultimate Parent with no fewer than three Business Days
notice of any such proposed action, attaching, if the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is in connection with a purported Superior Proposal, a
copy of the Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a
description of such Superior Proposal), and if the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is due to an Intervening Event, which notice
shall describe such Intervening Event and the reasons for the proposed Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) during the three Business Day period, the
Company agrees that the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in
good faith with Ultimate Parent and its Representatives to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate and continues to negotiate in good faith during such
period regarding any such revisions to the terms of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) either (A) Ultimate
Parent shall not have irrevocably proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and Commitment Letters prior to the end of such
period, or (B) if Ultimate Parent within such period shall have proposed
irrevocable revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Commitment Letters, (1) if such proposed Company Adverse
Recommendation Change is in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company
Board, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Alternative
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal with respect to Ultimate Parents
revised proposal and (2) if such proposed Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, shall have determined
in good faith that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that, if applicable, each time material modifications to
the financial terms of an Alternative Proposal determined to be a Superior
Proposal are made, the three Business Days time period shall be extended for
two Business Days after notification of such change to Ultimate Parent to the
extent Ultimate Parent wishes to negotiate and continues to negotiate in good
faith during such period.

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall prohibit or be
deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company); _provided_ that neither the Company nor the
Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to
the extent in accordance with _Section 5.8(e)_.

(g) _Notice_. From and after the No Shop Period Start Date, the Company
agrees that (i) it will reasonably promptly notify Ultimate Parent (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days after receipt) if (A) any Acquisition
Proposal is received by it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and also provide an unredacted copy of such Acquisition Proposal if
made in writing (including any material updates, revisions or
supplements thereto), including any financing

 



59  commitments or other documents containing material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, and a written summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal if not made in writing (including any material updates,
revisions or supplements thereto), including any financing commitments or
other documents containing material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal and (B) any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated with, it or any of its
Representatives in connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person
seeking such information or discussions or negotiations, and in each case,
thereafter shall keep Ultimate Parent reasonably informed of any significant
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal
on a reasonably timely basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
of any change in the price or material change to any other material term or
condition thereof), and (ii) in the event that any such party modifies its
Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company shall notify
Ultimate Parent reasonably promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours) after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the fact that
such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such
modification.

(h) _Waiver of Standstill Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company may fail to enforce or waive any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality agreement it has
entered into with any Person, whether prior to or after the date hereof, to
the extent reasonably necessary to allow such Person to make a confidential
proposal to the Company Board.

Section 5.9 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The Parent Entities and, subject to _Section 5.8_, the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain
from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by the Parent
Entities or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or to avoid
any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, those in
connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the EDS APA and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) cause the satisfaction of
all conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , (iv) without limiting _Section
5.6_, vigorously defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other
proceedings to which it is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or
the EDS APA or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order,
(v) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order which
may adversely affect the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the EDS APA, in each case until the
issuance of a final, non-appealable order, and (vi) as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date
hereof, make or cause to be made all necessary applications and filings,
and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required
under the HSR Act; _provided_ , that the Company and the Parent Entities shall
cooperate with each other in connection with determining

 



60  whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required in connection with the consummation of the Merger and
seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such
filings; and _provided, further,_ that this _Section 5.9_ shall not apply to
the Companys obligations with respect to the Stockholder Meeting or Proxy
Statement, which shall instead by governed by  _Section 5.5_. The Company
and the Parent Entities shall furnish to each other all information required
for any application or other filing under any applicable Law (including
filings made by, or required to be made by, the Company with the SEC other
than the Proxy Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the EDS APA. Each of the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to substantially comply with any "second request" for additional
information or documentary material from the Department of Justice or the
Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ ") no
later than six (6) months after receipt of such second request and to produce
documents on a rolling basis. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the prior written consent of Ultimate Parent.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, none of the Parties
shall or shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly, take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business
organization or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impair or delay the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in _Article VI_ or the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting
this _Section 5.9(a)_, the Parent Entities and Merger Sub agree to take, and
to cause to be taken (including by causing their respective controlled
Affiliates to take), and, if (and only if) requested by Ultimate Parent in
writing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall agree to take and/or
to cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, and to cause to be made
(including by causing their respective controlled Affiliates to make), any and
all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Law or to the Parent Entities, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective controlled Affiliates that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time and the Closing, respectively,
to occur no later than the Initial End Date (or, if the Initial End Date is
extended pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)(i)_, the Final End Date) ("
_Undertakings_ "), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or businesses of the
Parent Entities, the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective controlled Affiliates or (y) accepting
any operational restrictions, including restrictions on the ability to change
rates or charges or standards of service, or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit any of the Parent Entities, the Companys, any
Company Subsidiarys, the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or freely operate, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of the Parent Entities, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time
or the Closing, as applicable, beyond the Initial End Date (or, if the Initial
End Date is extended pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_, the Final End Date);
_provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

 



61  Agreement, the Parent Entities and their respective controlled Affiliates
shall not be required to take or consent to (and neither the Company nor the
Company Subsidiaries shall agree to unless requested in writing by Ultimate
Parent) the taking of any such action that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be likely to result in a material adverse effect on the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Parent Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole after giving effect to the reasonably
anticipated economic benefits of the Merger (an " _Antitrust Material Adverse
Effect_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Parent Entities, the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective controlled
Affiliates shall be required to effect or agree to any Undertakings unless
such Undertakings are conditioned upon (and subject to) the consummation of
the Merger.

(b) The Company and Ultimate Parent shall give (or shall cause
their respective Affiliates to give) any notices to third parties, and use,
and cause their respective Affiliates to use, their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the EDS APA or (ii) disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided, however_ that the Company and Ultimate Parent shall
coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Company
Material Contracts in connection with consummation of the Merger and in
seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event
that either Party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in
this _Section 5.9(b)_, such Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other
Party, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Ultimate Parent,
their respective Affiliates, and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, as
applicable, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.9(b)_, in no event shall the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pay, commit to pay or be required
to pay any amounts, fees, penalties or other consideration or agree to any
other material concessions in order to obtain any third party consents
contemplated by this _Section 5.9(b) _without the prior written consent of
Ultimate Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), except that the Company shall be required to pay amounts for the
foregoing purposes to the extent that the Parent Entities provide to the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary in advance (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the necessary funds for such excess amounts and
it is acknowledged and agreed that except for any consents expressly
contemplated by _Section 6.1_, no receipt of any consents shall be a
condition or requirement to the consummation of the Merger or the Closing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.9_, each Party shall (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making
or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the EDS APA,
(ii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, and (iii) promptly inform
the other Parties of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each
Party will consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will consider in
good faith the

 



62  views of the other Parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each Party
will permit authorized Representatives of the other Parties to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
Ultimate Parents obligations in respect of the Undertakings, Ultimate Parent
shall have the unilateral right to control the review of the transaction under
the Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) from
the date hereof until the date that is seven (7) months after the date of any
Second Request, Ultimate Parent and the Company shall mutually agree (in each
case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to determine
whether or not the Parties will litigate with any Governmental Entities to
oppose any enforcement action or remove any court or regulatory orders
impeding the ability to consummate the Merger and (ii) after the date that is
seven (7) months after the date of any Second Request, Ultimate Parent shall
determine whether or not the Parties will litigate with any Governmental
Entities but only in a case to oppose any enforcement action or remove any
court or regulatory orders impeding the ability to consummate the Merger.
Without the prior written consent of Ultimate Parent, neither the Company nor

collective bargaining agreement (the " _Union Employees_ ") with compensation
and benefits required by the applicable collective bargaining agreements.

(b) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the eighteen-
month anniversary of the Closing Date, Ultimate Parent will provide (or cause
a Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent to provide) Continuing Employees who are not

including, without limitation, health, welfare and severance benefits, but
excluding equity compensation, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than those provided to such Company Non-Union Employees immediately prior to

64 (c) For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, participation and
benefit accrual (excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) under Ultimate Parents and its Subsidiaries plans and programs
providing employee benefits (including, without limitation, severance) to

each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and their respective
predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent providing such

that Continuing Employees are eligible or become eligible to participate in
Parent Benefit Plans, Ultimate Parent shall (or shall cause a Subsidiary of
Ultimate Parent to) cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each Parent Benefit
Plan; (ii) each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, hospital,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any employee, all pre-existing condition

Employee under comparable Company Benefit Plans); and (iii) any co-payments,
deductibles and other eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee
and/or his or her covered dependents during the plan year ending on the
Closing Date to be credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year of each comparable Parent Benefit Plan (to the extent such credit would
have been given under comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing).

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 5.13_ with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective Parties and shall not create any right in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company
Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued
employment with the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Parent Entities or
any Subsidiary of the Parent Entities.

Section 5.14  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Parent Entities and the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company or such Company Subsidiary pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or
governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and any indemnification
agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, arising out
of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided, however,_ that the Parent Entities agree to, and will cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such Persons to the
fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parent Entities and the Surviving Corporation shall
advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in
the defense of any 

 



65  claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.14(a)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws
and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational
or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that the director, officer or employee to whom expenses are advanced
undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to the Parent Entities and the
Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such director,
officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 5.14(a)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Effective Time) is made against such Persons with respect to
matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.14(a)_
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than
are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws.
The indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without
any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(c) For the benefit of the Companys directors and officers, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent
to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys
existing policy (true and complete copies which have been previously provided
to Ultimate Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of
such coverage. If the Company is unable to purchase such DandO Insurance prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Ultimate Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain
and fully pay the premium for DandO Insurance that is substantially equivalent
to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the Companys
existing policy (true and complete copies of which have been previously
provided to Ultimate Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, subject to the cost
limitation proviso in the previous sentence. The Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder for a period of not less than six years from and after
the Effective Time.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such

 



66  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving company or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.14_.

 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.14_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any past or present
directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom this _Section 5.14_
applies without the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed
that the Persons to whom this _Section 5.14_ applies are express third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.14_).

(f) In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or any Parent
Entity of this _Section 5.14_, the Surviving Corporation or one of the Parent
Entities shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any past or present directors, officers and employees of
the Company in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 5.14_ as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such
Person.

 

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Each of the Surviving Corporation
and the Parent Entities shall take all such actions reasonably required to
cause the Companys securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.16 _Director Resignations_. To the extent requested by Ultimate
Parent in writing at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, on
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be delivered to Ultimate Parent
duly signed resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of the
directors of the Company Subsidiaries designated by Ultimate Parent and
shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Section 5.17 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the Merger, the Company and Company Board shall grant
such approvals and take such actions within their control as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and to otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Deadline or (y) by Ultimate Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ prior to
the No Shop Period Start Date based on a right arising out of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the
Companys entrance into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in each case,
prior to the No Shop Period Start Date or with respect to an Excluded Party
prior to the Excluded Party Deadline. Any Parent Expenses previously paid by
the Company to Ultimate Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall be
credited towards the payment of the Company Termination Fee. The Parties have
agreed in light of the circumstances existing at the time of execution of this
Agreement (including the inability of the Parties to quantify the damages that
may be suffered by the Parent Entities) this  _Section 7.2_ is reasonable,
that the Company Termination Fee represents a good faith, fair estimate of the
damages that the Parent Entities would suffer and that the Company Termination
Fee shall be payable as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) without
requiring Ultimate Parent to prove actual damages. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the Company fails to effect
the Closing for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this Agreement
(whether willfully, intentionally, knowingly or otherwise) or fails to perform
hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, knowingly or otherwise), then,
except for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 8.13_, the sole and exclusive remedy
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Parent
Entities and the Parent Related Parties against the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future equity
holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Representatives, general or limited partners, managers, management companies,
members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former,
current or future equity holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, general or limited partners, managers, management
companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the
foregoing, and any and all former, current or future heirs, executors,
administrators, trustees, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing
(collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") in respect of this Agreement,
any Contract or agreement executed in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article VII_ and collect hereunder, if due,
(i) the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section 7.2(b)_; (ii) any
amount due pursuant clause (ii) of _Section 7.2(a)_ and (iii) any costs,
expenses and/or interest payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, and upon
payment of all such amounts, no Company Related Party shall have any other
liability or obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Parent Entities or any other Parent Related Party in connection with
this Agreement (including the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and neither the Parent Entities nor any other
Parent Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any other Company Related
Party arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

 



73  hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent
Entities agree that the maximum aggregate liability of the Company under this
Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee
and, if applicable, the Parent Expenses, plus the applicable amounts
referenced in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the prior sentence, and in
no circumstances shall the Parent Entities seek any money damages in the
aggregate in excess of such amount.

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event that:

(i) This Agreement is terminated by the Company or Ultimate Parent pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ and (A) as of the date of such termination the
condition set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied, (B)
the Company had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, and (C) immediately before such termination, the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_, _Section 6.2(b)_ and _Section 6.2(d)_ would have
been satisfied had the Closing taken place as of the date of termination;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Ultimate Parent pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ ( _provided_ that such final and non-appealable
injunction or similar order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger shall have been issued or entered
pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws) and (A) the Company had the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_, and (B)
immediately before such termination, the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_,  _Section 6.2(b)_ and _Section 6.2(d)_ would have been satisfied
had the Closing taken place as of the date of termination;

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iii)_;

 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_; or

 

(v) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ and at the time of such termination the Company would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_;

then the Parent Entities shall, jointly and severally, in any such event
under clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 7.2(c)_, pay to the Company a
termination fee of $400 million in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination (it being understood that in no event
shall the Parent Entities, collectively, be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion). For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent Entities have a joint and several obligation to pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to clause (i) above notwithstanding that a
Governmental Entity has required that the Parent Entities and/or the Company
(or any of their Subsidiaries) take one or more actions to obtain approval
under the HSR Act that, if taken, would constitute an Antitrust Material
Adverse Effect. The Parties have agreed in light of the
circumstances existing at the time of execution of this Agreement (including
the inability of the Parties to quantify the damages that may be suffered by
the Company) this _Section 7.2(c)_ is

 



74  reasonable, that the Parent Termination Fee represents a good faith, fair
estimate of the damages that the Company would suffer in the applicable
circumstances and that the Parent Termination Fee shall be payable as
liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) without requiring the Company to
prove actual damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event that the Parent Entities and/or Merger Sub fail to
effect the Closing for any reason or no reason or otherwise breach this
Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally, knowingly or otherwise) or fail
to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, knowingly or
otherwise), then, except for an order of specific performance as and only to
the extent expressly permitted by _Section 8.13_, the sole and exclusive
remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Related Parties against the Parent
Entities and each of their respective former, current or future equity
holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general
or limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
Affiliates, Representatives or assignees and any and all former, current or
future equity holders, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies,
members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and
any and all former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators,
trustees, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing, (each, a " _Parent
Related Party_ ," and collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") in
respect of this Agreement, any Contract or agreement executed in connection
herewith (including the Debt Commitment Letters, the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Guarantees) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this _Article VII_ and
collect hereunder or as otherwise provided in the Guarantees, if due, (i) the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_; (ii) any amount
due pursuant to _Section 7.5_, _Section 7.6_, and clause (ii) of _Section
7.2(a)_; and (iii) any costs, expenses and/or interest payable pursuant to 
_Section 7.2(d)_, and upon payment of all such amounts, no Parent Related
Party shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Company Related Party
in connection with this Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letters, the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantees) (including the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Company
nor any other Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
other claim, action or proceeding against the Parent Entities, Merger Sub or
any other Parent Related Party arising out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Entities,
under this Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee, plus the applicable amounts referenced in clauses (ii) and
(iii) of the prior sentence, and in no circumstances shall the Company
seek any money damages in excess of such amount.

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these
agreements, the other Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company or the Parent Entities, as the case may be, fail
to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Ultimate Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences an action which results in a judgment against the Company or the
Parent Entities, as applicable, with respect to the payment by such Party(ies)
set forth in this _Section 7.2_, such paying Party(ies) shall pay the Party

 



75  commencing such action, as applicable, its reasonable and documented costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such aggregate amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(e) _Available Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, except for an order of specific performance as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by _Section 8.13_, in the event that any of the Parent
Entities, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other, fail to complete the
Closing as required pursuant to _Section 1.3_ then the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
against any Parent Related Parties), on the one hand, or the Parent Entities
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, against the Company Related Parties),
on the other, shall be the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_ and receipt of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee,
as applicable, plus the applicable amounts referenced in _Section 7.2(b)_ or
_Section 7.2(c)_, as applicable.

Section 7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been received, no amendment may be made without
further approval of the Companys stockholders which, by Law or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the Parties. 

Section 7.4 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided, however,_ that after the
Company Stockholder Approval has been received, there may not be, without
further approval of the Companys stockholders, any extension or waiver of
this Agreement or any portion thereof which, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Section 7.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Section 5.2_,  _Section
5.7(e)_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.6_ of this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by the Parties shall be borne solely and entirely by the Party which
has incurred the same; _provided, however,_ that in the event this Agreement
is terminated prior to the Closing for any reason, the Parent Entities shall,
jointly and severally, reimburse any fees, costs and expenses incurred or paid
by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and consummation of the EDS APA, each of the agreements and other
documents to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
deliverables to be delivered by the Company or any of its Affiliates
thereunder

 



76  and in connection with any third party consents, filings or notifications
thereunder), and the transactions contemplated thereunder.

 

Section 7.6 _Spin-Off Indemnity_. In the event that (i) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ after the consummation of the Blackhawk
Spin-Off, and (ii) pursuant to a Final Determination it is determined that the
Blackhawk Spin-Off is taxable under Section 311(b) of the Code because it
violates the "device" prohibition of Section 355(a)(1)(B) of the Code or
fails to satisfy the "business purpose" requirement applicable to a
distribution under Section 355 of the Code, in either case, as a direct result
of a connection between the Blackhawk Spin-Off and this Agreement, the Parent
Entities shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Net Spin-Off Tax
Amount; provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities shall
have no obligation to pay the Net Spin-Off Tax Amount to the Company if:

(a) such termination occurs pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, _Section
7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ of this Agreement; or

(b) the Company has not received opinions of Latham and Watkins LLP (addressed
solely to the Company), as counsel to the Company, reasonably acceptable to
the Parent Entities (the " _Opinions_ "), concluding that (i) as of the date
of the Blackhawk Spin-Off, that the Blackhawk Spin-Off "should" qualify as a
tax-free distribution pursuant to Section 355 of the Code (and not be subject
to Section 355(d) or Section 355(e) of the Code) if the Merger Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing (other than a termination occurring pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ of this Agreement), and (ii) as of
the date of such termination, that the Blackhawk Spin-Off "should" qualify as
tax-free pursuant to Section 355 of the Code (and not be subject to Section
355(d) or Section 355(e) of the Code). The Opinions (A) must address all
relevant aspects of Section 355 of the Code as they relate to the Blackhawk
Spin-Off, including addressing the application of Section 355(a)(1)(B) of the
Code and the "business purpose" requirement applicable to a distribution under
Section 355 of the Code to the Blackhawk Spin-Off generally and in light of
this Agreement, and (B) must rely on reasonable representations from the
Company that are consistent with the substance of the Draft Spin-Off Rep
Letters, including (I) a representation by the Company (with supporting
documentation from Goldman Sachs consistent with the Goldman Sachs Business
Purpose Letter) that the Company has substantial business reasons for
effecting the Blackhawk Spin-Off unrelated to the Agreement, together with a
reasonably detailed description of such business reasons, and (II) a
representation by the Company that irrespective of this Agreement (or any
other potential acquisition of stock of the Company) the Company intends to
consummate and would consummate the Blackhawk Spin-Off. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Opinions shall not rely on representations stating solely that the
Blackhawk Spin-Off does not violate the "device" prohibition of Section
355(a)(1)(B) of the Code or that the Blackhawk Spin-Off satisfies the
"business purpose" requirement applicable to a distribution under Section 355
of the Code to reach such conclusions on such legal issues;

(c) the Company or Blackhawk takes one of the following actions prior to the
second anniversary of such termination:

(i) the Company or Blackhawk merges with another entity or substantially all
of the assets of the Company or Blackhawk are acquired by another entity;

 



77 (ii) the Company or Blackhawk issues stock (or any other instrument that
is convertible into, or exchangeable for, any such stock) in an acquisition
or public or private offering (other than any compensatory related issuances
described in Section 1.355-7(e)(i) of the Treasury Regulations) representing
more than 40% of the stock of the Company or Blackhawk; or

(iii) the Company or Blackhawk facilitates or otherwise participates in
the acquisition of its stock that would result in any shareholder owning 5%
or more of the outstanding stock of the Company or Blackhawk; or

 

(d) such Final Determination is a direct result of (A) the inaccuracy of, or
any action of the Company or Blackhawk inconsistent with, any representation
of the Company or Blackhawk relied on by the Opinions, (B) the Companys
breach of any representation or covenant in this Agreement or (C) the
inaccuracy of any representation or other information provided in the Pre-
Signing Spin-Off Diligence Documents (for the avoidance of doubt, in each of
(A), (B) and (C), excluding any representation to the extent solely stating
that the Blackhawk Spin-Off does not violate the "device" prohibition
of Section 355(a)(1)(B) of the Code or that the Blackhawk Spin-Off satisfies
the "business purpose" requirement applicable to a distribution under Section
355 of the Code).

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section
7.6_ and _Section 7.7_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 7.7 _Tax Claims Concerning Blackhawk Spin-Off_. If a claim shall be
made by any taxing authority, which, if successful, could result in an
obligation of the Parent Entities to pay the Net Spin-Off Tax Amount (a " _Tax
Claim_ "), then the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent in writing of
such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the requirement of the Parent Entities to pay the Net Spin-
Off Tax Amount except to the extent the Parent Entities have been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Parent Entities and the Company
shall jointly control, and shall have the right to participate (at their own
expense) in all aspects of, any such Tax Claim (including having counsel
present in any discussions or conferences and reviewing, drafting, and
consenting to any correspondences with such taxing authority (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld)) or any other formal or informal discussions
with a taxing authority, in each case to the extent relating to the
qualification of the Blackhawk Spin-Off under Section 355 of the Code, and
neither the Parent Entities nor the Company shall settle any such Tax Claims
without the prior written consent of the other (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

Section 7.8 _Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election_.

 

(a) The Company shall be entitled to make the Blackhawk Section 336(e)
Election; provided, no Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election shall be made unless
the Company enters into the agreement provided in _Section 7.8(b)_.

(b) Before making the Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election, the Company will
enter into a written agreement with Blackhawk, which may be in the form of an
amendment to the Tax Sharing Agreement, that provides for the following:

 



78 (i) subject to clause (iv) below, Blackhawk will report the consequences
of the Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election in a manner consistent with the
Companys reporting as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Company;

 

(ii) if it is determined by the Company that, as a result of the Blackhawk
Section 336(e) Election, the Company will be treated as consolidated with
Blackhawk for U.S. federal (or applicable state) tax purposes for any period
(or portion thereof) after the date of the 2013 IPO Sale, any income Taxes
(other than income Taxes referred to in clause (iii) below) payable by the
Company that are attributable to the income of Blackhawk for such period shall
be paid by Blackhawk and Blackhawk shall indemnify the Company for any such
Taxes and any reasonable related expenses of attorneys or other
tax professionals;

(iii) the income Taxes payable with respect to the deemed asset sale pursuant
to the Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election shall be paid by the Company and the
Company shall be entitled to any refunds of such income Taxes; and

 

(iv) the allocation of "aggregate deemed asset disposition price" (" _ADADP_
") under Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-3 will be agreed upon by the
Company and Blackhawk, with any disputes to be resolved by an Independent Tax
Accountant.

 

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent with respect to all tax reporting
and tax positions relating to the Blackhawk Section 336(e) Election,
including the decision of whether to try to obtain a private letter ruling
relating thereto and the scope of such ruling, and Parent and the Company
shall jointly control the determination of such tax reporting and tax
positions, including the allocation described in clause (b)(iv) above (it
being understood that, in the event of any dispute relating to such
allocation, the decision of the Independent Tax Accountant shall control).

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to amend the existing
Tax Sharing Agreement to the extent reasonably necessary to give effect to
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.8_. No such amendment will be
entered into without the consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

(a) Subject to _Section 8.8(d)_, this Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles

the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware; _provided, however_ , the provisions of this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York with respect to any action, suit or proceeding including
any Debt Financing Source.

(b) Subject to _Section 8.8(d)_, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection

hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such

Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the

affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF 

 



103  LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND

VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.10(C)_.

 

Section 8.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. Disclosure of any item on the Company
Disclosure Schedules pertaining to any representation or warranty of the
Company by reference to any particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement
shall be deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any other Section or
Subsection of this Agreement pertaining to any representation or warranty
of the Company to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure item
is reasonably apparent. The provision of monetary or other quantitative
thresholds for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply
a standard of materiality hereunder. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Schedules, or in any update thereto, shall not be deemed to
be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary
course of business.

 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that each Party
need not sign the same counterpart. A facsimile copy or

obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with  _Article VII_ (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof without
proof of damages or the posting of any collateral, bond or other security,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in _Article VII_ (including the
limitation on the availability of any damages remedy) shall not be construed
to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect the Companys right to
injunctive relief, specific enforcement or other equitable relief, and (c) the
right of injunctive relief, specific enforcement and other equitable relief
is an integral part of this Agreement and transactions related hereto, and
without that right, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement.
Each Party agrees that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_ , it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties
have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches
of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or to obtain other equitable remedies in accordance with this
_Section 8.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond, collateral or other
security in connection with any such injunction. Notwithstanding

 



104  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the
right of the Company to seek specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies in connection with enforcing the obligation (a) to fund
the Equity Financing in order to consummate the Closing (but not the right of
the Company to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies for obligations other than with respect to the actual funding of the
Equity Financing to consummate the Closing including the right of the Company
to enforce or cause the Parent Entities to enforce the Equity Financing to the
extent reasonably necessary to fund costs and expenses of the Parent Entities
incurred and payable prior to Closing, which shall not be limited by this
_Section 8.13_) shall be subject to the requirements that (x) all the
conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (and
continue to be satisfied) or waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions at Closing) at the time when the Closing would
have occurred (not taking into account the failure of the Financing to be
funded) or been required to occur pursuant to _Section 1.3_, (y) the Debt
Financing, if applicable, or the Alternative Financing has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or would be funded in accordance with the
terms thereof at the Closing and (z) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing) are funded, then it would take all actions that are
within its control to cause the Closing to occur; and (b) to cause the Debt
Financing (or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing) to be funded (but not
the right of the Company to specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies for obligations other than with respect to the actual
funding of the Debt Financing (or, if applicable, Alternative Financing)) in
order to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the requirements that (x)
the Marketing Period has ended and all the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred (not taking into
account the failure of the Financing to be funded) or been required to
occur pursuant to _Section 1.3_ and (y) all of the conditions to the
consummation of the Debt Financing (or, if applicable the Alternative
Financing) provided for by the Debt Commitment Letters (or applicable
substitute documentation for Alternative Financing) have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
the Closing or at the time of funding). Until such time as this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with  _Article VII_ and the Parent Entities
pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ (and any amounts owed pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ and
_Section 7.5_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
its right to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies subject to the limitations in this _Section 8.13_; and for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
its right to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief or other equity
remedies subject to the limitations in this _Section 8.13_ to enforce the
Companys rights pursuant to _Section 7.6_ and the other provisions of this
Agreement that expressly survive termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)_ (subject to any applicable limitations in such provisions).
For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company and the Parent Entities may
pursue both a grant of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this _Section 8.13_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee (and, in
each case, any amounts owed pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_), as applicable,
under no circumstances shall the Company or the Parent Entities be permitted
or entitled to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee 

 



105  or the Parent Termination Fee (and, in each case, any amounts owed pursuant
to _Section 7.2(d)_) in the event specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies are granted causing the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated.

 



106 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parent Entities and the Company have caused
this Agreement to be executed as of the date hereof by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized.

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

 

Section 2.1 _Issuance of CVRs_.

 

The Company shall issue the CVRs at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms
of the Merger Agreement, and the CVRs shall represent the right of the
Holders to receive, in respect of each CVR held by such Holder, the CVR
Payment Amount (if any) if and when payable pursuant to this Agreement. The
administration of the CVRs shall be handled pursuant to this Agreement in the
manner set forth in this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Nontransferable_.

 

The CVRs or any interest therein shall not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer.

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change
of Address_.

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

 __(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
registration of CVRs in a book-entry position for each Holder, transfers of
CVRs as herein provided and any new issuances of CVRs in respect of any
Reverted Company Shares. The CVR Register shall set forth the name and address
of each Holder, the number of CVRs held by such Holder and the Tax
Identification Number of each Holder. The CVR Register will be updated as
necessary by the Rights Agent to reflect the addition or removal of Holders
(including pursuant to any Reverted Company Shares or Permitted Transfers).
Each of the Company and the Shareholder Representative may receive and
inspect a copy of the CVR Register, from time to time, upon written request
made to the Rights Agent. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
request, the Rights Agent shall mail a copy of the CVR Register, as then in
effect, to the Company and the Shareholder Representative at the address set
forth in _Section 7.1_. __

 

(c) Subject to the restriction on transferability set forth in _Section 2.2_,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer and any other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Rights Agent, duly executed by
the registered Holder thereof, the Holders attorney duly authorized in
writing, personal representative or survivor and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions herein including
_Section 2.2_, register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register. All
duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid
obligations of the Company,

 



8  evidencing the same right, and shall entitle the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No
transfer of a CVR shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and
any transfer not duly registered in the CVR Register will be void ab initio
(unless the transfer was permissible hereunder and such failure to be duly
registered is attributable to the fault of the Rights Agent). Any transfer or
assignment of the CVRs shall be without charge (other than the cost of any
transfer tax, which shall be the responsibility of the transferor) to the
Holder.

 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures; Payment Amount_.

 

(a) The Holders shall be entitled to the following payments in respect of
their CVRs (any such payments, in the aggregate, the " _CVR Payment Amount_
"):

(i) _Payment for Partial Casa Ley Sales_. Subject to the procedures set forth
in  _Section 2.4(c)_, upon the consummation of any Partial Casa Ley Sale,
each Holder of a CVR shall, in respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall
receive the Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR with respect to such Partial
Casa Ley Sale.

(ii) _Payment for Entire Casa Ley Sales_. Subject to the procedures set forth
in _Section 2.4(d)_, upon the consummation of the Entire Casa Ley Sale, each
Holder of a CVR shall, in respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall
receive the Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR.

 

(iii) _Payment upon Sale Deadline_. Subject to the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.4(e)_, upon the Sale Deadline, each Holder of a CVR shall, in
respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall receive the Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds Per CVR.

(iv) _Deferred Cash Consideration_. To the extent that any consideration
pursuant to any Partial Casa Ley Sale or Entire Casa Ley Sale includes any
deferred cash consideration (including pursuant to any escrow, holdback or
similar amount and including any such deferred cash consideration in
connection with a Partial Casa Ley Sale or Entire Casa Ley Sale consummated
prior to the Closing), each Holder of a CVR shall be entitled to and shall
receive an amount with respect to such CVR equal to (x) the amount of such
deferred cash consideration received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
( _minus_ the product of (A) 39.25% and (B) the amount of such deferred cash
consideration, less an allocable amount of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries tax basis in their Equity Interests in Casa Ley, calculated
under U.S. federal income tax principles, but only to the extent, if any, that
such basis was not previously taken into account in determining the amount of
the payments in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.4(a)),
_divided_ by (y) the number of CVRs listed in the CVR Register as of the date
of such calculation. Such deferred cash consideration amounts received by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be paid by the Company, within
two

 



9  (2) Business Days after its receipt thereof, directly to the Rights Agent
for payment to the Holders.

 

(b) _Currency Conversion_. To the extent that any proceeds described herein
are received in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount of such
proceeds shall be deemed to be the U.S. dollar amount actually received by the
Company upon the Companys conversion of such proceeds into U.S. dollars at
the direction of the Shareholder Representative. To the extent any expenses,
fees or costs are incurred or paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the
actual U.S. dollar amount that was funded by the Company into the Shareholder
Representative Expense Amount or that was a Pre-Funded Amount (excluding any
amount that remains unused on the consummation of the Casa Ley Sale and that
is distributed from the joint account to the Company on such date in
accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_ below) shall be used in the calculation of
the "Casa Ley Sale Expenses".

(c) _Procedure for Partial Casa Ley Sales_.

 

(i) Promptly following the closing of a Partial Casa Ley Sale but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Company shall deliver to
the Shareholder Representative (with a copy to the Rights Agent and Ultimate
Parent) the Companys good faith written calculation, in reasonable detail and
with supporting documentation, work papers and receipts of the Partial Casa
Ley Net Proceeds and the resulting Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR (the
" _Partial CVR Payment Statement_ "), which shall be certified by the Company.
The Partial CVR Payment Statement shall incorporate any Casa Ley Sale
Expenses of the Shareholder Representative set forth in writing by the
Shareholder Representative to the Company within such ten (10) Business Day
period, which shall be certified by the Shareholder Representative. Ultimate
Parent and the Company shall be protected in relying in good faith upon such
certification.

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Partial CVR Payment
Statement, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Company and the
Rights Agent (with a copy to Ultimate Parent) a notice specifying whether the
Shareholder Representative agrees with (a " _Notice of Agreement_ ") or
objects to (a " _Notice of Objection_ ") such CVR Payment Statement.

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Agreement, then
any Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR shall be due and payable to the
Holders pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(e)_ below. If
the Shareholder Representative does not deliver either a Notice of Objection
or a Notice of Agreement within such five (5) Business Day period, then the
Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of
Agreement with respect to such CVR Payment Statement at the end of such
period.

(iv) Any Notice of Objection shall contain the Shareholder
Representatives calculation of the Partial CVR Net Proceeds and the
resulting Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR that such Shareholder
Representative believes Holders are entitled to receive. Such Notice of
Objection must also be accompanied by a description in reasonable detail of
each of the objections to the calculations reflected in the Notice of
Objection

 



10 _ _ (collectively, the " _Objections_ "). For a period of ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of the Notice of Objection, the Company and the
Shareholder Representative shall, in good faith, try to resolve any
Objections; ___provided_ __, __ _however_ __, that to the extent that the
Company and the Shareholder Representative shall disagree, the Shareholder
Representative s good faith calculation of the Partial CVR Net Proceeds and
the Resulting Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR (as modified to give
effect to the results of any discussions and negotiations pursuant to this
clause (iv)) shall control. __

(d) _Procedure for the Entire Casa Ley Sale or upon the Sale Deadline_.

 

(i) Following the occurrence of the Sale Deadline, if the Company and
Shareholder Representative cannot by mutual consent agree on the Fair Market
Value of any unsold Equity Interests of Casa Ley then owned by the Company and
any Company Subsidiary using a generally accepted valuation method, then
within ten (10) Business Days following the Sale Deadline, each of the Company
and the Shareholder Representative shall separately select an internationally
recognized independent investment banking firm with expertise in valuing,
selling or providing financing with respect to companies engaged, publicly or
privately, in the food and drug retail business in Mexico within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of the prior ten (10) Business Day period and
instruct such investment banks to select and mutually agree upon another
investment bank to be retained, which investment bank shall be instructed by
the parties to, within twenty (20) Business Days from the date of its
retention, prepare and deliver a calculation of the Fair Market Value to the
Company and the Shareholder Representative, which shall be the final
determination of the Fair Market Value binding upon the Company and the
Shareholder Representative for purposes of the Remaining Asset Amount.

 

(ii) Promptly following the completion of the Entire Casa Ley Sale or the
occurrence of the Sale Deadline, but in no event later than the later of (A)
twenty (20) Business Days thereafter and (B) three (3) Business Days following
receipt of the calculation of the Fair Market Value referenced in _Section
2.4(d)(i)_ above, the Company shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative
(with a copy to the Rights Agent and Ultimate Parent) the Companys good faith
written calculation of the Casa Ley Net Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds (including any Partial Casa Ley Sales), and the resulting Casa Ley
Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable (the
" _Entire CVR Payment Statement_ "). The Entire CVR Payment Statement shall
incorporate any Casa Ley Sale Expenses of the Shareholder Representative set
forth in writing by the Shareholder Representative to the Company within such
twenty (20) Business Day (or applicable later) period, which shall be
certified by the Shareholder Representative. Ultimate Parent and the Company
may rely in good faith upon such certification. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company shall deliver an Entire CVR Payment Statement even if it believes
that there are no Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds
Per CVR due and payable. Such Entire CVR Payment Statement will be
accompanied by the Companys calculation in reasonable detail of the
components of the Casa Ley Net Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds, as
applicable, including a good faith written calculation, in reasonable detail
and with supporting documentation, work papers and receipts, of the Casa Ley
Sale Expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Shareholder Representative Expense Amount and any Pre-Funded Amounts pursuant
to _Section 3.3(b)_), along with an Officers Certificate certifying such
Casa Ley Sale Expenses and

certification.

 

(iii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the CVR Payment Statement, the
Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Company and the Rights Agent
(with a copy to Ultimate Parent) a Notice of Agreement or a Notice of
Objection to such Entire CVR Payment Statement. During such thirty (30) day
period, the Company shall cooperate with and permit, and Ultimate
Parent shall cause the Company to cooperate with and permit, the Shareholder
Representative and any accountant or other consultant or advisor retained by
the Shareholder Representative access during normal business hours to such
records and personnel (including the external auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the
Entire CVR Payment Statement and the amounts underlying the calculation of the
Entire CVR Payment Amount.

 

(iv) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Agreement, then
any Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as
applicable, shall be due and payable to the Holders pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this _Section 2.4(d)_ below, and, after delivery of any Casa Ley
Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable,
with respect to all Holders to the Rights Agent, Ultimate Parent and the
Company shall thereafter have no further obligations with respect to such Casa
Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR. If the
Shareholder Representative does not deliver either a Notice of Objection or a
Notice of Agreement within such thirty (30) day period, then the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Agreement with
respect to such CVR Payment Statement at the end of such period.

(v) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to the
Company within such thirty (30) day period, such Notice of Objection shall
contain the Shareholder Representatives calculation of the Casa Ley Net
Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds (including any Partial Casa Ley
Sales), and the resulting Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable. Such Notice of Objection must also be
accompanied by a description in reasonable detail of each of the Objections,
and a certificate certifying that the CVR Payment Amount reflected in the
Notice of Objection was calculated in the manner required under this
Agreement.

(vi) If the Company does not agree with any of the Objections, the Objections
that are in dispute shall be submitted to [] (the " _Neutral Auditor_
").3 Such Neutral Auditor shall, within thirty (30) Business Days of such
submission, resolve any differences between the Company and the Shareholder
Representative and such resolution shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
final, binding and conclusive upon Ultimate Parent, the Company, the
Shareholder Representative, each of the other parties hereto and each of the
Holders. The costs, fees and expenses of such Neutral Auditor shall be borne
equally by the Company and the Shareholder Representative; with any such
costs, fees and expenses of the Shareholder Representative being offset
against any Casa Ley Net Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds (including
any Partial Casa Ley Sales), and the resulting Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR
or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any such costs, fees and expenses of such Neutral Auditor to be
borne by the Company shall not be considered to be Casa Ley Sale Expenses.
Upon such resolution, the Company and the Shareholder Representative shall
notify the Rights Agent of such resolution and any Casa Ley Net Proceeds

(e) Once any Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per CVR, Casa Ley Net Proceeds Per

business on the last Business Day prior to such CVR Payment Date. Any Casa

the Holders pursuant to any Partial Casa Ley Sale, the Entire Casa Ley Sale

deducted or withheld, from the CVR Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 



13 (g) Any funds comprising the cash deposited with the Rights Agent under 
_Section 2.4(e)_ that remain undistributed to the Holders twelve (12) months

for such CVRs shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of their
claim therefor; _provided_ , that to the extent any deferred cash
consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_ becomes due and payable
after such date, such deferred cash consideration shall be deposited with the
Rights Agent pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_ and any such funds that remain
undistributed shall only be delivered to the Company twelve (12) months after
the Rights Agents receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any portion of the consideration provided by the Company to the Rights
Agent that remains unclaimed immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Company free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto, subject to any escheatment Laws.

Section 2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest in Ultimate Parent or the Company_.

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest
shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder (without

to the Merger.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any Partial Casa
Ley Sale, any Entire Casa Ley Sale or in connection with any deferred cash

Representative established and maintained for the benefit of the Holders and

Section 3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_.

 

(a) Neither (i) the Rights Agent nor (ii) the Shareholder Representative, the
Shareholder Representatives direct or indirect holders of Equity Interests,

 



14  any individual member of the committee that comprises or controls the
Shareholder Representative or, as applicable, any of their respective
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives
(such Persons described in this clause (ii) in their capacities as such, the "
_Shareholder Representative Persons_ ") shall have any liability or
responsibility to any Person (A) of any kind whatsoever for its performance
of any duties imposed on the Shareholder Representative hereunder or for any
actions taken or not taken in connection with this Agreement, (B) for any acts
or omissions of the other parties hereto or (C) for damages, losses or
expenses arising out of this Agreement, except to the extent of their gross
negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct. No Shareholder
Representative Person shall have any duties, fiduciary or otherwise, under
this Agreement except the duty to act in good faith and except as expressly
set forth herein. No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights
Agent or any Shareholder Representative Person to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have the exclusive authority to act
on behalf of the Holders in enforcing any of their rights hereunder, including
the delivery of a Notice of Objection, statement of Objections and
negotiation. The Shareholder Representative shall be under no obligation to
institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to take any other action
likely to involve material expense. All rights of action under this Agreement
may be (and shall only be) enforced by the Shareholder Representative, and
any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the Shareholder Representative
shall be brought in its name as Shareholder Representative on behalf of the
Holders, and any recovery of judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of all
the Holders, as their respective rights or interests may appear in the CVR
Register.

Section 3.2 _Certain Rights of Rights Agent_.

The Rights Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent. In
addition:

(a) the Rights Agent may rely in good faith upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent,
order or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

(b) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice of such counsel or any opinion of counsel shall be full
and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

 

(c) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things enumerated in this
Agreement shall not be construed as a duty; and

 

(d) the Rights Agent shall not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of the
premises.

 



15 Section 3.3 _Indemnity and Expenses_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Shareholder
Representative Person for, and hold the Rights Agent harmless against, any
loss, liability, claim, demand, suit, cost, damage or expense, including
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising out of or in connection with the
Rights Agents and the Shareholder Representatives respective duties
under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of defending the Rights Agent and each individual member of the
Committee that comprises or controls the Shareholder Representative against
any claims, charges, demands, investigations, suits or loss or liability,
unless it shall have been finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be a direct result of the Rights Agents or such Shareholder
Representative Persons gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional
misconduct. The right to indemnification conferred in this _Section 3.3(a)_
shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company for the
reasonable expenses incurred by such Person entitled to be indemnified under
this _Section 3.3(a)_ who was, or is threatened to be made a named defendant
or respondent in a claim, charge, demand, investigation or suit in advance of
the final disposition thereof and without any determination as to the
Persons ultimate entitlement to indemnification. The rights granted pursuant
to this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment,
modification or repeal of this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall have the effect of
limiting or denying any such rights with respect to claims, charges, demands,
investigations and suits arising prior to any such amendment, modification or
repeal. The Shareholder Representative Persons aggregate liability to
any Person with respect to, arising from, or arising in connection with this
Agreement, or from all services provided or omitted to be provided under this
Agreement, whether in contract, or in tort, or otherwise, is limited to, and
shall not exceed, the amounts paid hereunder by the Company to the
Shareholder Representative as fees and charges, but not including reimbursable
expenses. Indemnification under this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall continue as to a
Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such
Person to indemnity hereunder. Any such amounts incurred by the Company in
connection with this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall be a Casa Ley Sale Expense.

 

(b) The Company or any of its Affiliates shall, at the Effective Time,
transfer to a joint account of the Company and the Shareholder Representative
funds in the amount of $25,000,000 for use by the Shareholder Representative
(the _"Shareholder Representative Expense Amount_ " __). If the Shareholder
Representative shall require any amounts in excess of the Shareholder
Representative Expense Amount, at the request of the Shareholder
Representative from time to time, the Company or an Affiliate of the Company
will promptly pre-fund to such joint account an amount reasonably specified
by the Shareholder Representative in respect of expected expenses of the
Shareholder Representative in connection with the Casa Ley Sale (including
payments to such advisors as the Shareholder Representative may choose to
engage in connection with the Casa Ley Sale) and performance of its
obligations and duties hereunder (any such amount, a _"Pre-Funded Amount"_ ).
Any funds from the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount or Pre-Funded
Amounts that remain unused on the earlier of the consummation of the Casa Ley
Sale and the Sale Deadline shall be distributed from the joint account to the
Company five (5) Business Days after the payment of the Casa Ley Net Proceeds
Per CVR or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR.

 



16 (c) The Company agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in
connection with this Agreement as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(c)_ hereto and
(ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent for all taxes and governmental charges
(other than taxes measured by the Rights Agents income) and reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and necessary fees and
expenses of the Rights Agents counsel) paid or incurred by the Rights Agent
in connection with the administration of its duties hereunder. Any invoice for
any out-of-pocket expenses and per item fees realized will be rendered and
payable by the Company within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company,
except for postage and mailing expenses, which funds must be received one (1)
Business Day prior to the scheduled mailing date. For the avoidance of doubt,
50% of such fees, expenses and reimbursements contained in this _Section 3.3_
shall be Casa Ley Sale Expenses and the remaining 50% of such fees, expenses
and reimbursements shall not be Casa Ley Sale Expenses.

Section 3.4 _Resignation and Removal of Rights Agent and Shareholder
Representative; Appointment of Successor_.

3.4(b)_, become the successor Rights Agent.

(c) If (i) a successor Rights Agent has not been appointed pursuant to
_Section 3.4(b)_ and has not accepted such appointment within thirty (30)
days after the initial Rights Agent delivers notice of its resignation

become incapable of Acting, the Shareholder Representative or the Company may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Rights
Agent, if applicable, and the appointment of a successor Rights Agent.

(d) If at any time any individual members of the committee that comprises or
controls the Shareholder Representative shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, the remaining members of the committee that comprises or
controls the Shareholder Representative shall promptly appoint a qualified
successor individual member to such committee. The successor individual
member so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment
in accordance with this _Section 3.4(d)_, become a successor individual
member of the committee comprising the Shareholder Representative; _provided_
, that (x) such successor individual member of the committee comprising the
Shareholder Representative may not be a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Affiliates 

 



17  and (y) the Company agrees to indemnify the Shareholder Representative for
any and all actions taken in connection with this _Section 3.4(d)_.

individual member of the committee comprising the Shareholder Representative.
The Rights Agent (or successor Rights Agent) shall mail notice of each
resignation and each removal of a Rights Agent or individual member of the
committee comprising the Shareholder Representative and each appointment of a
successor Rights Agent or individual member of the committee comprising the
Shareholder Representative to the Holders within ten (10) days after receipt
of notice thereof from the Company. Each such notice provided to the Rights
Agent, Shareholder Representative, or Holders shall include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, as
applicable.

Section 3.5 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_.

Every successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative appointed hereunder
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring
Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, as applicable, an instrument
accepting such appointment and a counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon
such successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights,
powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent or Shareholder
Representative (as applicable); but, on request of the Company or
the successor Rights Agent, such retiring Rights Agent shall execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Rights Agent all the
rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Rights Agent.

extent legally permissible (and subject to the Shareholder Representatives

applicable Law or any agreements binding on the Company with respect to Casa
Ley), reasonably promptly provide to the Shareholder Representative all
information received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
Casa Ley or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Company shall vote (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to vote) their respective direct or indirect Equity
Interests in Casa Ley and its Subsidiaries as directed by the Shareholder

Leys governing documents or any material liability or obligation of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or

 



18  any of their Affiliates, (iii) the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure that (A) the Casa Ley Business will be operated
substantially in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

Ley Sale to the Company or any Company Subsidiary such that it may be
distributed to the Holders, (iv) the Company shall not (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) enter into any material transaction, agreement or
commitment with Casa Ley or any of its Subsidiaries without the
Shareholder Representatives prior written consent (such consent not to be

in accordance with their respective terms, of any such transaction, agreement
or commitment between Casa Ley or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, that are in effect
as of the Effective Time and (v) the Company shall not, shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Casa Ley

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the consummation of the Entire
Casa Ley Sale or the Sale Deadline, whichever is earlier, the Shareholder
Representative shall be responsible for conducting the sale process of Casa

Shares is contemplated, responsible for overseeing and making any decisions
on behalf of the Company with respect to such sale process of Casa Ley, and
the Company hereby agrees that it will act at the direction of the Shareholder

all actions necessary or advisable in order to consummate a Casa Ley Sale,
including retaining advisors in connection with the Casa Ley Sale, soliciting
potential purchasers for the Equity Interests owned by the Company and any
Company Subsidiary and determining which purchaser to select, negotiating the

Sale, including the use of commercially reasonable efforts (i) to provide
such information, financial or otherwise, with respect to Casa Ley, its
Subsidiaries or the Casa Ley Business as the Shareholder Representative may
reasonably request, to the extent such information is reasonably available to,
or can be reasonably obtained by, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
to assist in the preparation of disclosure schedules, exhibits and ancillary
agreements contemplated in the applicable sales agreement relating to the

from Governmental Entities and consents and notices required to be obtained
from or made to other Persons under the sales agreement relating to the Entire
Casa Ley Sale or any such Partial Casa Ley Sale; _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of the Company
or its Affiliates in complying with this _Section 4.3(b)_ shall be Casa Ley
Sale Expenses, other than Excluded Expenses (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not be Casa Ley Expenses). The Company shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, afford to the Shareholder Representative reasonable access,

reasonable time to the Company and Ultimate Parent for review of
such documents.

(d) In the event a definitive agreement is to be entered into prior to the
Sale Deadline with respect to the Entire Casa Ley Sale or one or more Partial
Casa Ley Sales, such agreement shall not, without the consent of the Company
(which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (i) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to agree to
any material operating restrictions applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (other than customary (A) confidentiality and/or employee non-
solicitation restrictions that survive for no more than two (2) years from and
after the Effective Time and, (B) restrictions relating to Casa Ley, any of
its Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or

 



20  assets, the Casa Ley Business, any portions thereof or, to the extent such
restrictions are reasonable, the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
management, operation or oversight thereof), (ii) require the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to agree to any recourse applicable to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in excess of any escrow amount, holdback or similar amount
after the closing of such agreement other than with respect to any customary
indemnity obligations that are shared proportionately (based on their
respective Equity Interests) among all of the participating Casa Ley
shareholders for (A) any breaches by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
of (x) its covenants or agreements contained in such agreement or (y) any
customary representations in such agreement relating to organization,

above) relating to the securities or assets of Casa Ley or any of its
Subsidiaries being directly or indirectly sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of in connection with such Entire Casa Ley Sale or Partial Casa Ley
Sale after the closing of such agreement or (iv) be sold for a price that is
payable in consideration other than cash or that, in the good faith judgment
of the Shareholder Representative, would cause the Casa Ley Net Proceeds or
the Partial Casa Ley Net Proceeds from such sale agreement to be less than
zero. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in
any definitive agreement with respect to the Entire Casa Ley Sale or any
Partial Casa Ley Sale, the Shareholder Representative shall control any third
party claims relating to or arising under any such definitive agreement to the
extent that any damages claimed thereunder are reasonably likely to be
covered in full by any escrow, holdback or similar amount thereunder without
direct liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any costs, fees
or expenses incurred by such Shareholder Representative in connection
therewith shall be included in Casa Ley Sale Expenses.

(e) Upon the consummation of the Entire Casa Ley Sale or any Partial Casa Ley
Sale, unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the purchaser under
such Casa Ley Sale Agreement, all intercompany arrangements and obligations
between the Company and Casa Ley will be terminated and the Company shall
take all actions necessary or advisable to cause such termination.

Section 4.4 _Books and Records_.

 

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient
detail to enable the Shareholder Representative and its consultants or
professional advisors to determine the amounts payable hereunder.

Section 7.2 _Notice to Holders_.

 

Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing
and if delivered personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed), sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) or mailed, first-class postage
prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his, her or its address as
it appears in the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not
earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In
any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail
such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 

Section 7.3 _Counterparts; Headings_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts (whether by facsimile,
pdf or otherwise), each of which shall be deemed an original, but such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission). The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part hereof.

 

Section 7.4 _Assignment; Successors_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1_, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any of the
parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by all of the parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_
, that this Agreement may not be enforced directly by any Holder but may only
be enforced on behalf of the Holders by the Shareholder Representative.

 

Section 7.5 _Benefits of Agreement_.

 

Except as set forth in _Article III_ with respect to the Shareholder
Representative Persons, nothing in this Agreement, is intended to or be
deemed to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder.
The Shareholder Representative shall be the sole and exclusive 

 



27  representative of the Holders for all matters in connection with this
Agreement and this Agreement may not be enforced directly by any Holder but
may only be enforced on behalf of the Holders by the Shareholder
Representative.

Section 7.6 _Governing Law_.

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Other than with respect to
disputes submitted to the Neutral Auditor under _Section 2.4(d)(vi)_, each
party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State
of Delaware and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that
any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such Delaware
court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
such Delaware court. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 7.1_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

Section 7.7  _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7.7_

 



28 Section 7.8 _Remedies_.

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.10_, (a) the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof without proof of damages or the posting of any
collateral, bond or other security, this being in addition to any other remedy
available at law, in equity, under this Agreement or otherwise and (b) the
right of injunctive relief, specific enforcement and other equitable relief
is an integral part of this Agreement and transactions related hereto. The
parties also agree that the non-prevailing party (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final, nonappealable order) in any litigation
relating to the enforcement of this Agreement shall reimburse the prevailing
party for all costs incurred by the prevailing party (including reasonable
legal fees in connection with any litigation). To the extent the Shareholder
Representative is the non-prevailing party, its reimbursement obligation under
this _Section 7.8_ shall be a Casa Ley Sale Expense.

 

Section 7.9 _Severability Clause_.

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and
conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 7.10 _Termination_.

 

This Agreement and each CVR shall be terminated and of no further force or
effect, and the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder, upon (i)
the one (1) year anniversary of the later of (a) the payment of all Partial
Casa Ley Net Proceeds, Casa Ley Net Proceeds, Sale Deadline Net Proceeds and
the payment of all deferred cash consideration pursuant to  _Section
2.4(a)(iv)_, or (b) the Sale Deadline, or (ii) the written agreement of the
Company and the Shareholder Representative to terminate this Agreement. Notice
of any such termination will be promptly mailed by the Rights Agent to the
Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
_Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, and this _Article VII_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement indefinitely.

Section 7.11 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, all documents and instruments referenced
herein and therein, and all exhibits and schedules attached to the foregoing,
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings,

 



29  both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof. If and to the extent that any provision
of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger Agreement,
this Agreement shall govern and be controlling.

Section 7.12 _Suits for Enforcement_.

 

In a case where breach has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing,
the Shareholder Representative may in its discretion proceed to protect and
enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement by such appropriate judicial
proceedings as the Shareholder Representative shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any of such rights (unless authorization and/or appearance
of each of the Holders is required by applicable Law), either at Law or in
equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or to enforce any other legal
or equitable right vested in the Shareholder Representative by this Agreement
or by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any liability of any of the parties hereunder (including the
Shareholder Representative) for breach of its obligations under this Agreement
shall not (other than in connection with fraud or willful misconduct, or third
party claims arising out of such partys breach of this Agreement) include
any unforeseeable and remote indirect or consequential damages, or any special
or punitive damages. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, any
liability of the Company may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Holders to the extent proximately caused by such breach (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to such
Holders under this Agreement but for such breach, the time value of money, and
any costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative
Persons in connection therewith) which shall be deemed in such event to be
damages recoverable by the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of the
Holders. With respect to any party other than the Company, under no
circumstances shall such party be liable for monetary damages hereunder.

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

 

Section 2.1 _Issuance of CVRs_.

 

The CVRs shall be issued at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement and shall represent the right of the Holders to receive, in
respect of each CVR held by such Holder, the CVR Payment Amount (if any) if
and when payable pursuant to this Agreement. The administration of the CVRs
shall be handled pursuant to this Agreement in the manner set forth in
this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Nontransferable_.

 

The CVRs or any interest therein shall not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer.

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change
of Address_.

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the _"CVR Register"_ ) for the
registration of CVRs in a book-entry position for each Holder, transfers of
CVRs as herein provided and any new issuances of CVRs in respect of any
Reverted Company Shares. The CVR Register shall set forth the name and address
of each Holder, the number of CVRs held by such Holder and the
Tax Identification Number of each Holder. The CVR Register will be updated as
necessary by the Rights Agent to reflect the addition or removal of Holders
(including pursuant to any Reverted Company Shares or Permitted Transfers).
Each of the Company and the Shareholder Representative may receive and
inspect a copy of the CVR Register, from time to time, upon written request
made to the Rights Agent. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
request, the Rights Agent shall mail a copy of the CVR Register, as then in
effect, to the Company and the Shareholder Representative at the address set
forth in _Section 7.1_.

 

(c) Subject to the restriction on transferability set forth in _Section 2.2_,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer and any other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Rights Agent, duly executed by
the registered Holder thereof, the Holders attorney duly authorized in
writing, personal representative or survivor and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions herein including
_Section 2.2_, register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register. All
duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid
obligations of the Company, evidencing the same right, and shall entitle the
transferee to the same benefits and rights under

 



9  this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR shall
be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any transfer not duly
registered in the CVR Register will be void  _ab initio_ (unless the transfer
was permissible hereunder and such failure to be duly registered is
attributable to the fault of the Rights Agent). Any transfer or assignment of
the CVRs shall be without charge (other than the cost of any transfer tax,
which shall be the responsibility of the transferor) to the Holder.

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

their CVRs (any such payments, in the aggregate, the  _"CVR Payment Amount"_

(i) _Payment for Partial PDC Sales_. Subject to the procedures set forth in 
_Section 2.4(b)_, upon the consummation of any Partial PDC Sale, each Holder
of a CVR shall, in respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall receive the
Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR with respect to such Partial PDC Sale.

 

(ii) _Payment for Entire PDC Sales_. Subject to the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.4(c)_, upon the consummation of the Entire PDC Sale, each Holder
of a CVR shall, in respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall receive the
PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR.

 

(iii) _Payment upon Sale Deadline_. Subject to the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.4(d)_, upon the Sale Deadline, each Holder of a CVR shall, in
respect of such CVR, be entitled to and shall receive the Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds Per CVR.

(iv) _Deferred Cash Consideration_. To the extent that any consideration
pursuant to any Partial PDC Sale or Entire PDC Sale includes any deferred cash
consideration (including pursuant to any escrow, holdback or similar amount
and including any such deferred cash consideration in connection with a
Partial PDC Sale or Entire PDC Sale consummated prior to the Closing), each
Holder of a CVR shall be entitled to and shall receive an amount with respect
to such CVR equal to (x) the amount of such deferred cash consideration
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary ( _minus_ the product of (A)
39.25% and (B) the amount of such deferred cash consideration, less an
allocable amount of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries tax basis in
the assets of the PDC Entities, calculated under U.S. federal income tax
principles, but only to the extent, if any, that such basis was not previously
taken into account in determining the amount of the payments in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this _Section 2.4(a)_) _divided by_ (y) the number of CVRs
listed in the CVR Register as of the date of such calculation. Such deferred
cash consideration amounts received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be paid by the Company, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt
thereof, directly to the Rights Agent for payment to the Holders.

 



10 (b) _Procedure for Partial PDC Sales_.

 

(i) Promptly following the closing of a Partial PDC Sale but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, the Company shall deliver to the
Shareholder Representative (with a copy to the Rights Agent and Ultimate
Parent) the Companys good faith written calculation, in reasonable detail and
with supporting documentation, work papers and receipts of the Partial
PDC Net Proceeds and the resulting Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR (the
_"Partial CVR Payment Statement_ " __), which shall be certified by the
Company. The Partial CVR Payment Statement shall incorporate any PDC
Sale Expenses of the Shareholder Representative set forth in writing by the
Shareholder Representative to the Company within such ten (10) Business Day
period, which shall be certified by the Shareholder Representative. Ultimate
Parent and the Company shall be protected in relying in good faith upon such
certification.

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Partial CVR Payment
Statement, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Company and the
Rights Agent (with a copy to Ultimate Parent) a notice specifying whether the
Shareholder Representative agrees with (a _"Notice of Agreement_ " __) or
objects to (a _"Notice of Objection_ " __) such Partial CVR Payment Statement.

 

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Agreement, then
any Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR shall be due and payable to the Holders
pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_ below. If the
Shareholder Representative does not deliver either a Notice of Objection or a
Notice of Agreement within such five (5) Business Day period, then
the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of
Agreement with respect to such Partial CVR Payment Statement at the end of
such period.

 

(iv) Any Notice of Objection shall contain the Shareholder Representatives
calculation of the Partial CVR Net Proceeds and the resulting Partial PDC Net
Proceeds Per CVR that such Shareholder Representative believes Holders are
entitled to receive. Such Notice of Objection must also be accompanied by a
description in reasonable detail of each of the objections to
the calculations reflected in the Notice of Objection (collectively, the
_"Objections_ " __). For a period of ten (10) Business Days after the
delivery of the Notice of Objection, the Company and the
Shareholder Representative shall, in good faith, try to resolve any
Objections; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that the Company and
the Shareholder Representative shall disagree, the Shareholder
Representatives good faith calculation of the Partial CVR Net Proceeds and
the resulting Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR (as modified to give effect to
the results of any discussions and negotiations pursuant to this clause (iv))
shall control.

 

(c) _Procedure for the Entire PDC Sale or upon the Sale Deadline_.

 

(i) Promptly following the completion of the Entire PDC Sale or the occurrence
of the Sale Deadline, but in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days
thereafter, the Company shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative (with
a copy to the Rights Agent and Ultimate Parent) the Companys good faith
written calculation of the PDC Net 

 



11  Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds (including any Partial PDC
Sales), and the resulting PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable (the " _Entire CVR Payment Statement_ "). The
Entire CVR Payment Statement shall incorporate any PDC Sale Expenses of the
Shareholder Representative set forth in writing by the Shareholder
Representative to the Company within such twenty (20) Business Day period,
which shall be certified by the Shareholder Representative. Ultimate Parent
and the Company may rely in good faith upon such certification. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall deliver an Entire CVR Payment Statement
even if it believes that there are no PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale
Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR due and payable. Such Entire CVR Payment
Statement will be accompanied by the Companys calculation in reasonable
detail of the components of the PDC Net Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds, as applicable, including a good faith written calculation, in
reasonable detail and with supporting documentation, work papers and receipts,
of the PDC Sale Expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount and any Pre-Funded Amounts
pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_), along with an Officers Certificate certifying
such PDC Sale Expenses and that the CVR Payment Amount was calculated in the
manner required under this Agreement. The Shareholder Representative may rely
in good faith on such certification.

 

(ii) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the CVR Payment Statement, the
Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Company and the Rights Agent
(with a copy to Ultimate Parent) a Notice of Agreement or a Notice of
Objection to such Entire CVR Payment Statement. During such thirty (30) day
period, the Company shall cooperate with and permit, and Ultimate Parent
shall cause the Company to cooperate with and permit, the Shareholder
Representative and any accountant or other consultant or advisor retained by
the Shareholder Representative access during normal business hours to such
records and personnel (including the external auditors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the
Entire CVR Payment Statement and the amounts underlying the calculation of the
CVR Payment Amount.

 

(iii) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Agreement, then
any PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as
applicable, shall be due and payable to the Holders pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this _Section 2.4(d)_ below, and, after delivery of any PDC Net
Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable,
with respect to all Holders to the Rights Agent, Ultimate Parent and the
Company shall thereafter have no further obligations with respect to such PDC
Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR. If the Shareholder
Representative does not deliver either a Notice of Objection or a Notice of
Agreement within such thirty (30) day period, then the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed to have delivered a Notice of Agreement with
respect to such Entire CVR Payment Statement at the end of such period.

(iv) If the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to the
Company within such thirty (30) day period, such Notice of Objection shall
contain the Shareholder Representatives calculation of the PDC Net Proceeds
or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds (including any Partial PDC Sales), and the
resulting PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as
applicable. Such Notice of Objection must also be accompanied by a description
in reasonable detail of each of the Objections, and a

 



12  certificate certifying that the CVR Payment Amount reflected in the Notice
of Objection was calculated in the manner required under this Agreement.

 

(v) If the Company does not agree with any of the Objections, the Objections
that are in dispute shall be submitted to [] (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ").3
Such Neutral Auditor shall, within thirty (30) Business Days of such
submission, resolve any differences between the Company and the Shareholder
Representative and such resolution shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
final, binding and conclusive upon Ultimate Parent, the Company, the
Shareholder Representative, each of the other parties hereto and each of the
Holders. The costs, fees and expenses of such Neutral Auditor shall be borne
equally by the Company and the Shareholder Representative; with any such
costs, fees and expenses of the Shareholder Representative being offset
against any PDC Net Proceeds or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds (including any
Partial PDC Sales), and the resulting PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale
Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
such costs, fees and expenses of such Neutral Auditor to be borne by the
Company shall not be considered to be PDC Sale Expenses. Upon such resolution,
the Company and the Shareholder Representative shall notify the Rights Agent
of such resolution and any PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or Sale Deadline Net
Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable, shall be due and payable to the Holders in
respect of each CVR held by such Holder pursuant to the procedures set forth
in this _Section 2.4_ below, and, after delivery of any PDC Net Proceeds Per
CVR or Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR, as applicable, with respect to all
Holders to the Rights Agent, Ultimate Parent and the Company shall thereafter
have no further obligations with respect to the PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or
Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR and shall, subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, no
longer be entitled to (i) any amount to the extent reflected in any such
finally resolved PDC Net Proceeds or Sales Deadline Net Proceeds or (ii) any
further PDC Sale Expenses. To the extent that the PDC Net Proceeds or the Sale
Deadline Net Proceeds are less than zero, the Company shall bear any
such costs, fees, expenses or losses.

(d) Once any Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR, PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR, Sale
Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR or any deferred cash consideration per CVR
payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_ becomes due and payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4(a)(iv)_, _Section 2.4(b)_, _Section 2.4(c)_ or  _Section
2.4(d)_, the Company shall establish a CVR Payment Date with respect to the
CVR Payment Amount that is within five (5) Business Days thereafter and shall
provide written notice to the Rights Agent and Shareholder Representative of
the same. At least two (2) Business Days prior to such CVR Payment Date, the
Company shall cause the Partial PDC Net Proceeds, the PDC Net Proceeds, the
Sale Deadline Net Proceeds or the aggregate amount of deferred
cash consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_ to be delivered
to the Rights Agent, who will in turn, on the CVR Payment Date, pay the
applicable Partial PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR, PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR, Sale
Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR or deferred cash consideration per CVR payable
pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_ to each of the Holders (recalculated as of

Shares _multiplied by_ the number of CVRs held by such Holder as reflected on
the CVR Register) by check mailed to the address of each Holder as reflected
in the CVR Register as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior

pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ and any such funds that remain undistributed
shall only be delivered to the Company twelve (12) months after the Rights
Agents receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any

the delivery of a Notice of Objection, statement of Objections and
negotiation. The Shareholder Representative shall be under no obligation to
institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to take any other action
likely to involve material expense. All rights of action under this Agreement

Section 3.2 _Certain Rights of Rights Agent_.

 



15 The Rights Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent. In
addition:

 

(a) the Rights Agent may rely in good faith upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent,
order or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

 

(b) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice of such counsel or any opinion of counsel shall be full
and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

 

(c) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things enumerated in this
Agreement shall not be construed as a duty; and

 

(d) the Rights Agent shall not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of the
premises.

Section 3.3 _Indemnity and Expenses_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Shareholder
Representative Person for, and hold the Rights Agent harmless against, any
loss, liability, claim, demand, suit, cost, damage or expense, including
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising out of or in connection with the
Rights Agents and the Shareholder Representatives respective duties
under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of defending the Rights Agent and each individual member of the
Committee that comprises or controls the Shareholder Representative against
any claims, charges, demands, investigations, suits or loss or liability,
unless it shall have been finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be a direct result of the Rights Agents or such Shareholder
Representative Persons gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional
misconduct. The right to indemnification conferred in this _Section 3.3(a)_
shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company for the
reasonable expenses incurred by such Person entitled to be indemnified under
this _Section 3.3(a)_ who was, or is threatened to be made a named defendant
or respondent in a claim, charge, demand, investigation or suit in advance of
the final disposition thereof and without any determination as to the
Persons ultimate entitlement to indemnification. The rights granted pursuant
to this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment,
modification or repeal of this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall have the effect of
limiting or denying any such rights with respect to claims, charges, demands,
investigations and suits arising prior to any such amendment, modification or
repeal. The Shareholder Representative Persons aggregate liability to
any Person with respect to, arising from, or arising in connection with this
Agreement, or from all services provided or omitted to be provided under this
Agreement, whether in contract, or in tort, or otherwise, is limited to, and
shall not exceed, the amounts paid hereunder by the Company to the
Shareholder Representative as fees and charges, but not including reimbursable
expenses. Indemnification under this _Section 3.3(a)_ shall continue as to a
Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such
Person to indemnity

 



16  hereunder. Any such amounts incurred by the Company in connection with this
_Section 3.3(a)_ shall be a PDC Sale Expense.

 

(b) The Company or any of its Affiliates shall, at the Effective Time,
transfer to a joint account of the Company and the Shareholder Representative
funds in the amount of $25,000,000 for use by the Shareholder Representative
(the _"_ _Shareholder Representative Expense Amount_ _"_ ). If the Shareholder
Representative shall require any amounts in excess of the Shareholder
Representative Expense Amount, at the request of the Shareholder
Representative from time to time, the Company or an Affiliate of the Company
will promptly pre-fund to such joint account an amount reasonably specified
by the Shareholder Representative in respect of expected expenses of the
Shareholder Representative in connection with the PDC Sale (including payments
to such advisors as the Shareholder Representative may choose to engage in
connection with the PDC Sale) and performance of its obligations and duties
hereunder (any such amount, a _"Pre-Funded Amount_ _"_ __). Any amounts spent
from the Shareholder Representative Expense Amount or Pre-Funded Amounts
shall constitute PDC Sale Expenses hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the
treatment of such amounts as PDC Sale Expenses shall result in corresponding
amounts of proceeds that will be retained by the Company, thereby reimbursing
the Company for such amounts. Any funds from the Shareholder Representative
Expense Amount or Pre-Funded Amounts that remain unused on the earlier of the
consummation of the PDC Sale and the Sale Deadline shall be distributed from
the joint account to the Company five (5) Business Days after the payment of
the PDC Net Proceeds Per CVR or the Sale Deadline Net Proceeds Per CVR.

 

(c) The Company agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in
connection with this Agreement as set forth on  _Schedule 3.3(c)_ hereto and
(ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent for all taxes and governmental charges
(other than taxes measured by the Rights Agents income) and reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and necessary fees and
expenses of the Rights Agents counsel) paid or incurred by the Rights Agent
in connection with the administration of its duties hereunder. Any invoice for
any out-of-pocket expenses and per item fees realized will be rendered and
payable by the Company within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company,
except for postage and mailing expenses, which funds must be received one (1)
Business Day prior to the scheduled mailing date. For the avoidance of doubt,
50% of such fees, expenses and reimbursements contained in this _Section 3.3_
shall be PDC Sale Expenses and the remaining 50% of such fees, expenses and
reimbursements shall not be PDC Sale Expenses.

 

Section 3.4 _Resignation and Removal of Rights Agent and Shareholder
Representative; Appointment of Successor_.

 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof

become incapable of Acting, the Shareholder Representative or the Company may

Agent, if applicable, and the appointment of a successor Rights Agent.

so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with this _Section 3.4(d)_, become a successor individual member

Shareholder Representative may not be a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Affiliates and (y) the Company agrees to indemnify the
Shareholder Representative for any and all actions taken in connection with
this _Section 3.4(d)_.

(e) The Company shall give written notice of each resignation and each
removal of a Rights Agent or individual member of the committee comprising the
Shareholder Representative and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent or
individual member of the committee comprising the Shareholder Representative
to the then acting members of the committee comprising the Shareholder
Representative or then acting Rights Agent, as applicable, within ten (10)
days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Rights Agent
or individual member of the committee comprising the Shareholder
Representative. The Rights Agent (or successor Rights Agent) shall mail notice
of each resignation and each removal of a Rights Agent or individual member of
the committee comprising the Shareholder Representative and each appointment
of a successor Rights Agent or individual member of the committee comprising
the Shareholder Representative to the Holders within ten (10) days after
receipt of notice thereof from the Company. Each such notice provided to the
Rights Agent, Shareholder Representative, or Holders shall include the name
and address of the successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, as
applicable.

 

Section 3.5 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_.

 

Every successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative appointed hereunder
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring
Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, as applicable, an instrument
accepting such appointment and a counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon
such successor Rights Agent or Shareholder Representative, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the

 



18  rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent or
Shareholder Representative (as applicable); but, on request of the Company or
the successor Rights Agent, such retiring Rights Agent shall execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Rights Agent all the

Entire PDC Sale or Partial PDC Sale after the closing of such agreement or
(iv) be sold for a price that is payable in consideration other than cash or
that, in the good faith judgment of the Shareholder Representative, would
cause the PDC Net Proceeds or the Partial PDC Net Proceeds from such sale
agreement to be less than zero. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything in any definitive agreement with respect to the
Entire PDC Sale or any Partial PDC Sale, the Shareholder Representative shall
control any third party claims relating to or arising under any such
definitive agreement to the extent that any damages claimed thereunder are

Section 7.2 _Notice to Holders_.

 

Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing
and if delivered personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed), sent by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) or mailed, first-class postage
prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his, her or its address as
it appears in the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not
earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In
any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail
such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 

Section 7.3 _Counterparts; Headings_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts (whether by facsimile,
pdf or otherwise), each of which shall be deemed an original, but such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement and
shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission). The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part hereof.

 

Section 7.4 _Assignment; Successors_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1_, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any of the
parties (whether by operation of

 



29  Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by all of the parties and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that this Agreement may not be
enforced directly by any Holder but may only be enforced on behalf of the
Holders by the Shareholder Representative.

 

Section 7.5 _Benefits of Agreement_.

 

Except as set forth in _Article III_ with respect to the Shareholder
Representative Persons, nothing in this Agreement, is intended to or be
deemed to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder.
The Shareholder Representative shall be the sole and exclusive representative
of the Holders for all matters in connection with this Agreement and this
Agreement may not be enforced directly by any Holder but may only be enforced
on behalf of the Holders by the Shareholder Representative.

 

Section 7.6 _Governing Law_.

 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles(whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Other than with respect to
disputes submitted to the Neutral Auditor under _Section 2.4(c)(v)_, each
party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State
of Delaware and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that
any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such Delaware
court, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
such Delaware court. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 7.1._ Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

Section 7.7  _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY

 



30  OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
7.7_ 

Section 7.8 _Remedies_.

 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.10_, (a) the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof without proof of damages or the posting of any
collateral, bond or other security, this being in addition to any other remedy
available at law, in equity, under this Agreement or otherwise and (b) the
right of injunctive relief, specific enforcement and other equitable relief
is an integral part of this Agreement and transactions related hereto. The
parties also agree that the non-prevailing party (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final, nonappealable order) in any litigation
relating to the enforcement of this Agreement shall reimburse the prevailing
party for all costs incurred by the prevailing party (including reasonable
legal fees in connection with any litigation). To the extent the Shareholder
Representative is the non-prevailing party, its reimbursement obligation under
this _Section 7.8_ shall be a PDC Sale Expense.

 

Section 7.9 _Severability Clause_.

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and
conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 7.10 _Termination_.

 

This Agreement and each CVR shall be terminated and of no further force or
effect, and the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder, upon (i)
the one (1) year anniversary of the later of (a) the payment of all Partial
PDC Net Proceeds, PDC Net Proceeds,

 



31  Sale Deadline Net Proceeds and the payment of all deferred cash
consideration pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_, or (b) the Sale Deadline, or
(ii) the written agreement of the Company and the Shareholder Representative
to terminate this Agreement. Notice of any such termination will be promptly
mailed by the Rights Agent to the Holders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement,  _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_,
_Section 3.3_, and this _Article VII_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement indefinitely.

 

Section 7.11 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, all documents and instruments referenced
herein and therein, and all exhibits and schedules attached to the foregoing,
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. If and to
the extent that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts
with the Merger Agreement, this Agreement shall govern and be controlling.

 

Section 7.12 _Suits for Enforcement_.

 

In a case where breach has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing,
the Shareholder Representative may in its discretion proceed to protect and
enforce the rights vested in it by this Agreement by such appropriate judicial
proceedings as the Shareholder Representative shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any of such rights (unless authorization and/or appearance
of each of the Holders is required by applicable Law), either at Law or in
equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or to enforce any other legal
or equitable right vested in the Shareholder Representative by this Agreement
or by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any liability of any of the parties hereunder (including the
Shareholder Representative) for breach of its obligations under this Agreement
shall not (other than in connection with fraud or willful misconduct, or third
party claims arising out of such partys breach of this Agreement) include
any unforeseeable and remote indirect or consequential damages, or any special
or punitive damages. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, any
liability of the Company may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
Holders to the extent proximately caused by such breach (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to such
Holders under this Agreement but for such breach, the time value of money, and
any costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative
Persons in connection therewith) which shall be deemed in such event to be
damages recoverable by the Shareholder Representative for the benefit of the
Holders. With respect to any party other than the Company, under no
circumstances shall such party be liable for monetary damages hereunder.

ARTICLE II

 

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 1\. Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or
outside the State of Delaware designated by the Board of Directors. The Board
of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not
be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication as provided under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "Delaware General Corporation Law"). In the absence of any
such designation, stockholders meetings shall be held at the principal
executive office of the corporation.

 

Section 2\. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors
and the transaction of such other proper business as may be brought before
the meeting, including those matters which are expressly reserved for the
approval of the stockholders as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation (subject to the terms set forth therein), shall be held on
such date and at such time and place as may be fixed by the Board of
Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.

Section 3\. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of which are present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these By-Laws.

Section 4\. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the votes
cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall decide any questions brought
before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by
express provisions of the statutes, or the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. In an
election of directors, each director of the corporation shall be

 



1  elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors.

 

Section 5\. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the
right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons
to act for him by proxy, appointed by an instrument in writing, which may be
transmitted to the corporation electronically. Each stockholder shall have one
vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in his name
on the books of the corporation on the record date set by the Board of
Directors.

Section 6\. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose, or
purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, may be called by the President and shall be called by the
President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the
Board of Directors. Such request shall set forth the date, time, place and
purpose or purposes of the meeting Business transacted at any special meeting
of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.

 

Section 7\. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action
at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which notice
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of
a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
The written notice of any meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled
to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it
appears on the records of the corporation.

 

Section 8\. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any
action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

 

ARTICLE III

DIRECTORS

2  less than three directors nor more than nine directors. The number of
directors may be reduced or increased from time to time by action of a
majority of the Board.

 

(b) Each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and
qualified; provided, however, that unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or law, any director or the entire Board of
Directors may be removed at any time, either with or without cause, from the
Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of stockholders owning a majority
in amount of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and
outstanding, and entitled to vote.

(c) Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his
resignation to the Corporation. A resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein or, if the time when it shall become effective shall not be
specified therein, immediately upon its receipt, and, unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective.

Section 2\. Vacancies on the Board of Directors by reason of death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or otherwise,
and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in
office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The
directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of
directors and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify,
unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an
election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.

 

Section 3\. The property and business of the corporation shall be managed by
or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to the powers
and authorities by these By-Laws expressly conferred upon them, the Board may

case may be, as shown on the corporations records.

Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall submit,
either before or after the time stated therein, a signed waiver of notice or
who shall attend the meeting, other than for the express purpose of objecting
at the beginning thereof to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Notice of an adjourned meeting,
including the place, date and time of the new meeting, shall be given to all
directors not present at the time of the adjournment, and also to the other
directors unless the place, date and time of the new meeting are announced at
the meeting at the time at which the adjournment is taken.

 

Section 4\. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of the
authorized number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum,
shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these By-Laws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall
constitute a quorum.

 

Section 5\. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a
meeting, if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing, or by electronic transmission, and the writing or
writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee, respectively. Such filing
shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall
be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

 



4 Section 6\. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated
by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of
Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 

COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS

 

Section 7\. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each
such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation.
Each committee (including the members thereof) shall serve at the pleasure of
the Board of Directors. The Board may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or
they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board
of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the
resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the
corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such
committee shall have the power or authority in reference to approving or
adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter (other
than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by Chapter 1 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for
approval or adopting, amending or repealing the By-Laws of the corporation.

Section 8\. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the Board of Directors when required.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Section 9\. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the
compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a
stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from
serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like
compensation for attending committee meetings or a stated salary as a
committee member.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 10.(a) The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by law any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by 

 



5  reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation, or, while serving as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause
to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding this Section 10(a)
or the provisions of Section 10(b) hereof, except as otherwise provided in
Section 10(f) hereof, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a
covered person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by
such covered person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part
thereof) by the covered person was authorized in the specific case by
the Board of Directors of the corporation.

(b) The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted by law any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or, while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation and except that no such indemnification shall be
made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Delaware Court or the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such
Delaware Court or such other court shall deem proper.

 

(c) To the extent that a present or former director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation shall be successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and
(b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

(d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a
court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer,
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b). Such
determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director,
officer,

 



6  employee or agent at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote
of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even
though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated
by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.

(e) Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by law in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as
authorized in this Section 10\. Such expenses incurred by former directors and
officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10 shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

 

If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of a
proceeding) or payment of expenses under this Section 10 is not paid in full
within 90 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the
corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the
expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In
any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the
claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of
expenses under applicable law.

 

(g) The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of a majority of a quorum
of the Board of Directors, the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out
of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section
10\.

(h) The Board of Directors may authorize the corporation to enter into a
contract with any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise providing for indemnification rights
equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than those
provided in Section 10\.

 

(i) For the purposes of this Section 10, references to "the corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any

 



7  constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Section 10 with respect to the resulting
or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued.

(j) For purposes of this Section 10, references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise
taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and
references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee
or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interest of the corporation" as referred to
in this section.

(k) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Section 10 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

(l) The corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses
to any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

(m) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
III, Section 10 shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder
of any person in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding
is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to,
any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

ARTICLE IV

or resolutions that some or all of any or all

 



10  classes or series of the corporations stock shall be uncertificated shares.

until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of

unless otherwise required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days
before the date of such meeting or action. A determination of stockholders of

Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS 

Section 6\. The corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of
any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly

ARTICLE VI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

DIVIDENDS

 

Section 1\. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared
by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.
Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock,
subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

Section 2\. Before payment of any dividend there may be set aside out of any
funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a
reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for
repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other
purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interests of the
corporation, and the directors may abolish any such reserve.

CHECKS 

Section 3\. All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall
be signed by such officer or officers as the Board of Directors may from time
to time designate.

Section 4\. The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of

SEAL

Section 5\. The Board of Directors may provide for a corporate seal, which

be in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Board of
Directors. Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be
impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.

NOTICES

 

Section 6\. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or required by
law, all notices required to be given pursuant to these By-Laws shall be in
writing and may in every instance be effectively given by hand delivery
(including use of a delivery service), by depositing such notice in the mail,
postage prepaid, or by sending such notice by prepaid overnight express
courier or facsimile. Any such notice shall be addressed to the person to
whom notice is to be given at such persons address or facsimile number, as
the case may be, as it appears on the records of the corporation. The notice
shall be deemed given 

 



12 (i) in the case of hand delivery, when received by the person to whom notice
is to be given or by any person accepting such notice on behalf of such
person,

(ii) in the case of delivery by mail, upon deposit in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the person to whom notice is being given at such
persons address as it appears on the records of the corporation,

 

(iii) in the case of delivery by overnight express courier, on the first
business day after such notice is dispatched, and

 

(iv) in the case of delivery via facsimile, when directed to the person to
whom notice is to be given.

 

Section 7\. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions
of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these By-Laws, a
waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said
notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent thereto. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose
of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members
of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice
or any waiver by electronic transmission, unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.

ARTICLE VII 

AMENDMENTS

 

Section 1\. These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed or new By-Laws
may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, when such
power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of
Incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of
Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board
of Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of
new By-Laws be contained in the notice of such special meeting. If the power
to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws is conferred upon the Board of Directors by
the Certificate of Incorporation it shall not divest or limit the power of
the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.

ARTICLE VIII

 

EXCLUSIVE FORUM

alternative forum, the Delaware Court shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (b) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by,
any director or officer of the corporation to the corporation or the
corporations stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the
corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the General 

 



13  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or these By-Laws or the Certificate
of Incorporation, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the
validity of these By-Laws or the Certificate of Incorporation, or (e) any
action asserting a claim against the corporation governed by the internal
affairs doctrine (any action described in clauses (a) through (e) being
referred to as a "Covered Action"), in each such case unless the Delaware
Court determines that there is an indispensable party named as a defendant in
such Covered Action not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court within 15 days following such
determination) and can be subject to the jurisdiction of another court or

(which may include drug store/pharmacy) and uses incidental thereto, and/or
for any other lawful retail use or uses commonly found in shopping centers of

will be for the joint and exclusive use of all tenants and occupants in the
Shopping Center, together with their subtenants, contractors, employees,
agents, customers, licensees and invitees, and Landlord grants to Tenant for

---|---|--- 
  



\- 5 - benefiting one or more occupants of the Shopping Center, provided that any
such easement over the Leased Premises that is not Common Area granted for
the benefit of anyone other than Tenant shall be subject to Tenants
reasonable approval, including approval of reasonable scheduling and other
construction protections to minimize disruption to Tenants business. The
Common Area may be used for vehicular driving, parking, pedestrian traffic,
directional signs, sidewalks, walkways, landscaping, perimeter walls and
fences, parking lot lighting, recycle centers, cart collection (but not
storage) corrals, utilities and Service Facilities and for such other purpose
as Landlord may approve, provided that any such other use of the Common Areas
not expressly permitted under this Lease shall not have a material adverse
effect upon use or operation of business from the Leased Premises, parking

be used for the parking of motor vehicles, drive aisles will be used for
access and traffic circulation, service areas will be used for servicing and
supplying tenants businesses, sidewalks will be used for pedestrian access
and landscaped areas, trash dumpster areas and shopping cart collection areas

fee.

respect to Common Area located in the portion of the Shopping Center owned by
Landlord other than the Leased Premises) and Tenant (with respect to Common
Area located on the Leased Premises) shall have the right to promulgate and
enforce rules and guidelines prohibiting or restricting publicly
expressive activity in their respective Common Area (including the
circulation of petitions, leafleting and picketing) not related to the
commercial purpose of the Shopping Center. If Tenant or any business conducted
in the Leased Premises is the target of such activity, then Tenant may
enforce such rules and guidelines on Landlords behalf and Landlord, at
Tenants expense, will cooperate with Tenant in this regard. Tenant will
indemnify,  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 6 - arising out of any enforcement activities by Tenant undertaken in accordance
with this _Section 3.3.2_. 
---|--- 
 



     | 3.3.3 |

Layout. The Leased Premises are part of a retail shopping center partially or
wholly developed as depicted on _Exhibit A_. No buildings or other structures
will be constructed outside the Building Area, except as provided in _Section
3.7_. Canopies may encroach from the Building Area over the Common Area and
canopy support columns may encroach onto the Common Area provided such
canopies and support columns do not interfere with the normal use of the
Common Area and provided further such canopies and support columns will be
considered part of the buildings to which they are attached and not part of
the Common Area improvements. All buildings will be subject to the Floor Area
limitations, if any, set forth on _Exhibit A_. The following will not be
permitted without Tenants prior approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed: (i) any change to either the
sizes or the arrangements of the Building Area and Common Area improvements
(including service drives and parking areas, traffic circulation and flow
patterns, parking lot layout, drive-thrus, parking lot lighting, perimeter
walls and fences, and landscaped areas) as shown on _Exhibit A_ and (ii) any
change to the land area of the Shopping Center (except as the result of a
taking by eminent domain, which will be covered by _Section 18_) or the
integration of the Shopping Center with any other lands or premises by means
of the granting of reciprocal access and/or parking rights; provided that no
such alteration shall (a) adversely affect the visibility of any buildings
and/or signage from the streets contiguous to the Shopping Center, (b)
adversely affect ingress and egress to/from the legal lots (which are located
in the Shopping Center) adjacent thereto, (c) adversely affect traffic
circulation and flow within the Shopping Center, or (d) reduce the number of
parking spaces available on a legal lot within the Shopping Center below the
greater of (x) the required applicable Parking Ratios, or (z) that required
by applicable law. Clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall not be deemed
to prohibit Landlords sale of portions of the Shopping Center which
constitute separate legal parcels to one or more third parties so long as such
sale does not change the land area of the Shopping Center or the integration
of the Shopping Center with any other lands or premises by means of the
granting of reciprocal access and/or parking rights. If said sizes or
arrangements of the Building Area or Common Area are changed, or the Shopping
Center land area is changed, without Tenants prior consent, then Tenant may
terminate this Lease by Notice to Landlord and/or seek other  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 7 - enforcement of the terms of this _Section 3.3.3_ by injunctive relief. In any
lawsuit for injunctive relief regarding the provisions of this _Section
3.3.3_, the Parties agree that the harm suffered by Tenant by reason of a
breach of this _Section 3.3.3_ will be deemed to be irreparable, for which
Tenant will not have an adequate remedy at law. 
---|--- 



     | 3.3.3.1 | Building Limitations: All buildings in the Shopping
Center will be [ _ _] story only (but may include mezzanines and
basements not open to the general public), and will be constructed only

screening.] [ Insert as applicable.] In-line buildings designed for small
tenant shops will not exceed [ _ _] feet in height, inclusive of

equipment and screening.] [Insert if applicable.] However, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, the parties hereby approve
of all existing buildings in the Shopping Center (including, without
limitation, the height and dimensions thereof), as the same may be repaired or
replaced from time to time so long as such repair or replacement is
consistent with existing conditions. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.3.4 | Additional Parking Rights. Tenant will have the exclusive
right to use the _ _ ( _ _) parking spaces designated
"Tenants Exclusive Parking" on _Exhibit A_ to park vehicles used in

operation of Tenants Building and the activities conducted at the Leased
Premises. 
---|--- 



     | 3.3.6 | Temporary Construction Staging. Tenant will have the right
to use such Common Area on the Leased Premises as is designated by Tenant,
sufficient for construction staging during any construction or
maintenance work performed by Tenant at the Leased Premises, provided that
such staging use shall not materially adversely affect ingress or egress to or
from the Leased Premises and other areas of the Shopping Center. And further
provided that Tenant shall give Landlord ten (10) days prior written notice
of the proposed locations of such area, which location shall be no less than [
_ _] feet from the entrance of any building on an adjacent legal
lot within the Shopping Center. Upon completion of such work by Tenant, Tenant
shall restore, or cause to be restored, the affected Common Area to a
condition equal to or better than that existing prior to the commencement of
such work. 
---|---|--- 



     | 3.3.7 | Employee Parking Areas. Tenant shall use reasonable
efforts to cause its employees to park their vehicles in the area marked
"Employee Parking Area" on _Exhibit A_. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts
to restrict parking for employees of other tenants of the Shopping Center to
portions of the Common Area reasonably designated by Landlord; provided such
areas may not be located on the Leased Premises under any circumstances and
any proposed employee parking area within that portion of Supermarket Control
Zone lying outside of the Leased Premises shall be subject to Tenants prior
written consent, consent which may be withheld in Tenants sole discretion.  
---|---|--- 



     | 3.3.8 | Restriction on Use of Portions of the Common Area.
Landlord, in its reasonable discretion, may from time to time restrict use of
portions of the Common Area as Landlord reasonably deems necessary when
Landlord is causing the performance of maintenance, repair or replacement
work to the Common Area as required under this Lease, but such restriction on
use shall be limited to the minimum time period reasonably practicable under
the circumstances of such work. Except when required in an emergency
situation, no such restriction on use of portions of the Common Area shall be
allowed between November 15 of any year and the January 2 of the succeeding
year.

     | 3.3.9.2 | Except in connection with an expansion of a building
within a permitted Building Area, Landlord shall not modify any Common Area
located within Supermarket Control Zone or within [ _ _] feet of
the boundary thereof without first obtaining Tenants consent which may be
withheld in Tenants sole discretion.

under this Lease beyond the expiration of any applicable period for cure,
Tenant is hereby granted the unconditional right at its option, to extend
the Term for sixteen (16) separate, consecutive and additional extension

days (but not more than 360 days) prior to the expiration of the Term, of
Tenants extension of the Term of this Lease effective as of the day following
the last day of the Original Term or Extension Term then in effect, and upon

as to length of term and number of remaining extensions. 
---|---|--- 



     | 4.4. | Holding Over. If Tenant remains in possession of the Leased
Premises after the expiration of the Term, such continued possession, if
Landlord does not object to it, will create a month-to-month tenancy under
the terms of this Lease but at one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
Monthly Rent payable during the last month of the Original Term or immediately
preceding Extension Term, as the case may be. Such tenancy may be terminated
at any time by either Party by thirty (30) days Notice to the other Party. 
---|---|--- 



   5. | RENT. 
---|--- 



     | 5.1. | Monthly Rent. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 14 - (defined above) Tenant will pay rent ("Monthly Rent") monthly in advance on
the first day of each calendar month as follows1: 
---|---|--- 



      |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  

Time Period

 |  |

Monthly Rent

 |  |

Annual Equivalent 

     |  | 
  

Years [1 through 5]

 |  | $[ _ _] per month |  | $[ _ _] per annum 
   |  | 
  

Year [6] and beyond

 |  | Refer to §5.1.2 below |  | 
 

The Monthly Rent for any fractional calendar month will be prorated based on a
360-day year. The "Years" referred to above are consecutive twelve-(12) month
periods commencing on the Original Term Commencement Date.



     | 5.1.2 | Monthly Rent shall be adjusted (but never decreased) on
the first (1st) day of each of Year [6], Year [11] and Year [16] (each, an
"Adjustment Date"), to equal the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Monthly Rent in effect immediately prior to the applicable Adjustment Date, by
(y) twice the amount of a fraction, the numerator of which is the CPI most
recently published for the calendar month which is three (3) months prior to
the applicable Adjustment Date and the denominator of which is the CPI most
recently published for the calendar month which is sixty-three (63) months
prior to the applicable Adjustment Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Lease, in no event shall Monthly Rent be decreased
on any Adjustment Date, and in no event shall Monthly Rent increase on any
Adjustment Date by more than five percent (5%) over Monthly Rent in effect
immediately preceding the applicable Adjustment Date (the "Adjustment Cap").
(By way of example, if the CPI increase is 3% and the Monthly Rent in effect
immediately prior to the Adjustment Date is $69,858.00 then twice the CPI
increase is 6%, which is reduced to 5% by the Adjustment Cap, so that the
resulting adjusted Monthly Rent is $73,350.90.)

   1  | Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, rent
commencement will occur in accordance with Section 5.4(b) of the Agreement and

glazing, flooring, loading dock doors, mechanical (including but not limited
to HVAC) and electrical systems completed), so that Tenant can install
Tenants decor package, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and exterior
signage, including pylon/monument sign panels. For the avoidance of doubt,
all life-safety systems (excluding fire sprinkler systems), monitoring systems
and telecommunications systems will be at Tenants cost, and Tenant shall be
responsible for purchasing all vertical transportation systems (but Landlord
shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of such vertical transportation systems as
building costs). 
---|--- 
 



\- 15 - separate Extension Term (if Tenant timely exercises the option to extend by
the applicable Extension Term pursuant to _Section 4.3_ hereof), shall
be adjusted (but never decreased) on the commencement of each Extension Term
to equal the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Monthly Rent in effect
immediately prior to the commencement of the applicable Extension Term, by (y)
twice the amount of a fraction, the numerator of which is the CPI most
recently published for the calendar month which is three (3) months prior to
the commencement of the applicable Extension Term and the denominator of which
is the CPI most recently published for the calendar month which is sixty-
three (63) months prior to the commencement of the applicable Extension Term.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, in no event
shall Monthly Rent be decreased on the commencement of any Extension Term,
and in no event shall Monthly Rent increase on the commencement of any
Extension Term by more than five percent (5%) over Monthly Rent in effect
immediately preceding the commencement of the applicable Extension Term
(also, the "Adjustment Cap". (By way of example, if the CPI increase is 3% and
the Monthly Rent in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the
Extension Term is $69,858.00, then twice the CPI increase is 6%, which is
reduced to 5% by the Adjustment Cap, so that the resulting adjusted Monthly
Rent is $73,350.90.)

Common Area shown on _Exhibit F_ as "[Name of Tenant] Lighting Area", then
Tenant shall not be entitled to obtain reimbursement from Landlord for the

itemization and statement. If the itemization and statement indicate an
overpayment by the Tenant, then Tenant will be entitled to an offset against
Monthly Rent thereafter becoming due for the amount of such overpayment;

insufficient to allow a full recovery by Tenant of such overpayment, then
Landlord shall refund the unrecovered amount to Tenant within thirty (30)
days following Landlords receipt of written request therefor from Tenant.
Within twenty (20) days following Tenants request, Landlord will make
available to Tenant at a location designated by Landlord, copies of all

made of such books of account and records by representatives of Tenant. Such
audit may be made only by Tenant giving Landlord at least twenty (20) days
prior Notice. There will be no more than one (1) audit for each calendar year,
and it must be completed within three (3) years from the expiration of the
calendar year being audited. If the audit discloses that any reimbursement by
Tenant for the period audited was not correct, Tenant will immediately pay any
additional amount due Landlord as disclosed by the audit and Tenant will be
entitled to offset against Monthly Rent thereafter becoming due the amount of
any overpayment as disclosed by the audit, provided that if the Monthly Rent
payable for the remaining Term is insufficient to allow a full recovery by
Tenant of the amount of such overpayment, then Landlord shall refund the
amount of such overpayment within thirty (30) days following Landlords
receipt of written request therefor from Tenant. If the audit discloses that
Tenant has overpaid or been over billed its actual share of Common Area
Maintenance Expenses by more than three percent (3%), as originally calculated
by Landlord, then the cost of the audit will be borne by Landlord.

Center are open for business. If artificial lighting for a time later than the
foregoing ("After Hours Lighting") is needed by any person, then such
artificial lights to service such person shall be separately metered or

reduced proportion of the expense of lighting the balance of the Common Area
according to the extent to which such person is lighting the Common Area by
separately metered lights.

     | 8.8. | Anything in this _Article 8_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, Landlord shall contract for and pay for all of the items
enumerated as maintenance and insurance expenses in this _Article 8_ ;

Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), without Tenants prior written approval of
said item. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.9. | Anything in this _Article 8_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, at least thirty (30) days prior to the initial commencement
of the cleaning and sweeping of the Common Area and any other Common
Area maintenance work done on a regular basis for which Tenant is obligated
to reimburse Landlord, Landlord shall submit said Common Area maintenance work

approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The names of the
bidding contractors or companies and the amounts of their respective bids

---|---|--- 



     | 8.10. | Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice from Tenant,
Landlord shall have the Common Area maintenance work, or any portion thereof
designated by Tenant, rebid in the manner set forth herein, and Tenants
pro rata share of said Common Area maintenance work shall thereafter be based
on the amount of the lowest bid unless Tenants prior written consent to award
the contract to a higher bidder is first obtained by Landlord. Following a
rebid of any item or items of Common Area maintenance, Tenant shall have no
right to require a subsequent rebid of the same item or items for a period of
at least one (1) year. The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord shall not be
required to rebid any item before the expiration of the term of the
applicable contract. In no event shall Landlord enter into any contract for
all or any portion of the Common Area maintenance work for a term in excess of
one (1) year without Tenants prior written approval. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.11. |

Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Tenants pro rata share of all of
Landlords out-of-pocket expenses in performing such Common Area maintenance
and insurance services (excluding, however, the cost of maintaining and
insuring any Service Facilities or driveup or drive through customer service

\- 26 - service charge of ten percent (10%) of said expenses to cover management and
administration costs; provided, however, that the ten percent (10%) service
charge shall not exceed Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350.00) for any item of
Common Area maintenance or insurance expense without Tenants prior written
approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Article 8_

occurs prior to the date of expiration of the useful life (as determined by
the ADR [asset depreciation range] midpoint life established by the
Internal Revenue Service in effect on the date of this Lease) of any
capitalizable improvements or additions made by Landlord to the Common Area
pursuant to _Article 8_ , Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after the
date of expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, refund to Tenant an
amount equal to Tenants pro rata share (including Tenants pro rata share of
the ten percent 10% service charge applicable thereto) of the unamortized cost
of said improvements or additions computed on a straight-line basis over the
useful life (as computed above) of said improvements or additions. The Common
Area expenses shall not include any costs incurred by Landlord for the
services of a manager or management company or for office overhead or
compensation of its employees except to the extent included in the ten percent
(10%) service charge. 
---|--- 



     | 8.12. | Landlord agrees to perform its duties under this _Article
8_ on a nonprofit basis with an end to keeping such expenses at a reasonable
minimum. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.13. | Tenant shall be billed quarterly in arrears for its pro
rata share of all expenses incurred by Landlord in maintaining and insuring
the Common Area as provided above (including the ten percent 10% service
charge described in _Section 8.12_) with the first billing date being the
last day of the first full calendar quarter following the date Tenant first
opens Tenants Building for business. Said bills shall be due and payable
within thirty (30) days after receipt and, if requested, copies of all
invoices, statements or other documents supporting same. Tenants pro rata
share of the Common Area maintenance and insurance expenses shall be  _
_ percent ( _ _%); provided, however, that (i) in the event the
total floor area (excluding mezzanines and basements not used for the sale or
display of merchandise) of all buildings in the Shopping Center exceeds _
_ square feet, Tenants pro rata share shall be reduced accordingly, and (ii)
in the event the total floor area of Tenants Building (excluding mezzanines
and basements not used for the sale or display of merchandise) exceeds _
_ square feet, Tenants pro rata share shall be increased accordingly.
Landlord waives any and all right to collect Tenants pro rata share of any
Common Area maintenance or insurance expense (including the ten percent 10%
service charge described in _Section 8.12_) for which a bill is not
submitted to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the end of the calendar year
in which said expense is incurred.

insurance 

---|---|---

Landlord at any time during reasonable business hours within three (3) years
after the end of said calendar year. If said inspection reveals an overpayment
of Common Area maintenance and insurance expenses (including the ten percent
10% service charge described in _Section 8.12_), Landlord shall reimburse
Tenant its proportionate share of any such overpayment within thirty (30) days
after receipt of notice of determination, and of the amount, of such
overpayment. If said inspection reveals an underpayment of Common
Area maintenance and insurance expenses (including the ten percent 10%
service charge described in _Section 8.12_ but excluding all expenses for
which a statement was not timely submitted), Tenant shall reimburse Landlord
its proportionate share of any such underpayment within thirty (30) days

lines, (ii) to the extent not separately metered, keeping the Common Area
lighted, and (iii) other non-segregable items reasonably agreed to by the

allocated ("Nonsegregable Costs"). Any other items which the parties agree in
writing after the date of this Lease cannot be practicably segregated or
allocated between the Parcels shall be included within the definition of Non-
segregable Costs. Tenant shall continue to proportionately pay the
Nonsegregable Costs pursuant to this Lease. In the event of any such
assumption by Tenant, Tenant shall no longer contribute its proportionate
share of the segregable maintenance items, and shall maintain, repair and
replace the Common Area of the Leased Premises at its sole cost and expense
and in a manner and at a level of quality required by the terms of this
Lease. Tenant may also elect to terminate its obligation to maintain, repair,
replace and insure the Leased Premises Common Area by giving at least sixty
(60) days prior written notice to Landlord, in which event Landlord shall
resume its duties with respect to the Leased Premises and Tenant agrees to pay
for its pro rata share of all Common Area expenses (including the allowable
service charge) thereafter incurred by the Landlord in accordance with this
Lease.

Law. Tenant may install in Tenants Building and Tenants Facilities such
fixtures and equipment as Tenant deems desirable, and all of said items will
remain Tenants property whether or not affixed or attached to the
real estate. Tenant will have the exclusive right to paint, erect or
authorize signs on the interior of Tenants Building, whether or not such
signs are visible from the exterior, and to place, erect, maintain, and
replace signs on the exterior of Tenants Building and Tenants Facilities or
extending therefrom, as Tenant deems advisable, subject to any applicable
requirements of the Sign Program and the Sign Criteria. The Shopping Center
has a multi-tenant monument type sign structure at each of the main entrances
as designated in the Sign Criteria (the "Shopping Center Signs"). Tenant will
have the right to place on each Shopping Center Sign structure (including
replacements thereof) and each pylon sign structure, if any, (including
replacements thereof) erected in or for the Shopping Center one (1) double-
sided sign panel. Each of Tenants sign panels will be (i) placed in the top
or most prominent and/or visible location (as selected by Tenant) on the
Shopping Center Signs, except a sign panel designating the name of the
Shopping Center, and (ii) at least twenty percent (20%) larger than any other
occupants sign panel on the sign structure(s). Tenant shall have a perpetual
license to maintain its sign panels on the Shopping Center Signs, with the
design, construction, installation and permitting thereof to be solely at
Tenants expense. Tenant shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense,
to install pylon and/or monument type signs on the Common Area of the Leased
Premises, if and to the extent legally permitted and shall have the sole right
to place sign panels on any such sign(s). Subject to applicable restrictions
in the Sign Program and the Sign Criteria, Tenant shall have the right, to
place signs identifying Tenant, plus such additional signage upon Tenants
Building as Tenant may desire (which may include, without limitation, signs
for Tenants pharmacy and/or in-store bank, if any), to the extent such
additional signage is permitted pursuant to applicable Laws. Tenant may remove
the items described in this _Section 12_ at any time and will remove them as
provided in  _Section 7.3_ upon the expiration or earlier termination of
this Lease. Tenant shall have the right on to display on Tenants Building and
elsewhere on the Leased Premises temporary banners or other signage for
special promotional events provided that any such signage complies with Law.
Any changes to the Sign Criteria shall require the prior written approval of
Tenant. In no event shall the name of the Shopping Center be changed without
the prior written

and absolute discretion.

     | 13.1. | Separation of Uses; Prohibited Uses. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.1.1 | Tenants Concern. Landlord recognizes Tenants customers
need for adequate parking facilities in close proximity to Tenants Building
and the importance of protecting such parking facilities against unreasonable
or undue use which is likely to result from long-term parking by patrons or
employees of certain types of business establishments. Landlord further
recognizes Tenants interest in not having tenants occupying space in
close proximity to Tenants Building that create or cause excessive noise,
litter or odor. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.1.2 | Landlords Safeguard for Tenant. To ensure adequate
parking for Tenants customers and to safeguard Tenants interest in a clean,
quiet environment, free of obnoxious odors, Landlord covenants that, except
as provided in _Section 13.1.2.4_ or as Tenant otherwise consents in writing,
which consent may be withheld by Tenant in its sole and absolute discretion,
(i) within [ _ _] of any main customer entrance to Tenants
Building it will not permit the operation of any Restaurant (fast-food or sit-
down), except as may be expressly otherwise permitted below, or Training or
Educational Facility (both as defined below), (ii) other than the Leased
Premises, it will not permit the use or operation of any portion of any
portion of the Shopping Center for any other Prohibited Use (as defined
below), and (iii) it will not permit the use or operation of any portion of
the Shopping Center for (a) the conduct of any illegal, offensive, noisy or
dangerous trade, business, activity or occupation, or (b) any other
unreasonable use not compatible with the operation of a first-class retail and
commercial shopping center, well maintained in accordance with the standards
of this Lease (collectively, "Prohibited Uses"). The prohibitions contained
in this Article 13 shall not be applicable to any tenants of the Shopping
Center under leases in place as of the Effective Date or replacement tenants
in the same leased premises operating for the uses as existing in the Shopping
Center as of the date hereof. 
---|---|---

ready-made, ready-to-eat and/or ready-to-heat meals for take-out such as "[ _
_]" and "[ _ _]" shall not be considered a "Restaurant". 
---|--- 



     | 13.1.2.2 | As used herein, "Training or Educational Facility"
means a beauty school, barber college, place of instruction, or any other
operation catering primarily to students or trainees rather than
to customers, but excludes employee training by Shopping Center tenants
incidental to the conduct of their businesses within the Shopping Center. For
these purposes, "incidental" shall have the meaning appropriate for the
context, and is not measured by the defined term used in _Section 13.1.2.3
(xviii)_ below. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.1.2.3 | Without limiting the generality of _Section 13.1.2_,
but subject to the exceptions set forth in _Section 13.1.2.4_ "Prohibited

provides services directly to consumers, including but not limited to real
estate, stock brokerage and title companies, travel and insurance agencies and
medical offices (subject to the restrictions contained in  _Section
13.2.2_), but office space used by an occupant for administrative purposes

set forth in this _Subsection (iii)_ shall not apply to a financial
institution.

beverages as an Incidental (defined below) part of the food service operation
of a full service Restaurant (which Restaurant nevertheless will be subject  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 36 - 13.1.2_), but in no event may such Incidental serving of alcoholic beverages
permit the operation of a "Sports Bar," as defined in the next sentence. A
"Sports Bar" means a bar that features multiple television monitors playing
sporting events and programs at least 75% of the time that such bar is open
for business.

No part of the Shopping Center other than the Leased Premises shall be used
for clinics or facilities that specialize in the delivery of medical services
and/or advice (including, without limitation, walk-in or emergent care
facilities), surgery centers or diagnostic or laboratory facilities.



     | 13.1.3 |

First-Class Operation. Landlord represents and warrants that it will operate
that portion of the Shopping Center owned by it as a first-class shopping
center in all respects, including maintenance of the Common Areas and other
buildings and tenant selection and mix, in order to preserve the Shopping
Centers appeal to the community in which the Shopping Center is located and
to protect Tenants investment in its business operations at the Leased
Premises. To achieve this objective Landlord will use and lease space in the
Shopping Center only for purposes that would commonly be found in first-class
shopping centers. Landlord agrees that, for so long as the Leased Premises
are operated as a supermarket, no space in the Shopping Center may be occupied
by any occupant which: (i) routinely advertises discounted prices, except for
the Leased Premises, (ii) routinely displays inventory 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 37 - "outlet" store, (iv) derives more than ten percent (10%) of its revenue from
the sale of "seconds" or damaged or defective merchandise, (v) derives more
than ten percent (10%) of its revenue from the sale of second-hand goods, or
(vi) routinely sells overstock merchandise from other retailers. Landlord
further agrees that no space in the Shopping Center may be occupied by any
occupant which: (a) advertises "payday loans" or equivalent services, derives
more than ten percent (10%) of its revenue from loans with an initial maturity
of ninety (90) days or less, or (b) derives more than ten percent (10%) of
its revenue from check-cashing services. 
---|--- 



     | 13.2. | Competitive Business. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.2.1 | Competitive Business Expectation. Landlord recognizes
that Tenant is entering into this Lease and is foregoing other opportunities
to locate its business in other locations based on the expectation ("Tenants
Expectation") that, except as set forth in _Sections 13.2.2_ and _13.2.3_ ,
Tenant will have the sole and exclusive right in the Shopping Center to sell
the items and provide the services described in the Supermarket Covenant.
Landlord further recognizes that (i) Tenant is making considerable investments
in fixtures, equipment, merchandise, personnel, and advertising, (ii) Tenant
is investing its business reputation in the Leased Premises, which reputation
will be adversely affected if Tenants sales volume is significantly less than
the level planned by Tenant, (iii) the addition of other businesses to the
Shopping Center that sell items and/or provide services described in the
Supermarket Covenant, except as permitted in _Sections 13.2.2_ and _13.2.3_ ,
will result in a reduction of Tenants sales and thus impair the benefit of
the bargain for which Tenant negotiated in entering into this Lease, and (iv)
Tenants agreement to pay Monthly Rent and to assume all other economic
obligations of this Lease are predicated upon Tenants Expectation. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.2.2 | Landlords Competitive Business Covenant. In recognition
and consideration of Tenants Expectation, Landlord covenants that, except as
provided hereinafter in _Section 13.2.3_, and unless Tenant otherwise
consents in writing, which consent may be withheld by Tenant in its sole and
absolute discretion, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

Tenant will have the sole and exclusive right in the Shopping Center to (a)
sell food (for purposes of this _Section 13.2_, the term "food" includes
alcoholic beverages) for off-premises consumption; pet foods; freshly brewed
coffee, espresso, coffee-based drinks or espresso-based coffee drinks ("Coffee
Drinks"); (b) sell merchandise  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 38 - required to be dispensed by or under the supervision of a registered
or licensed pharmacist, ("Prescription Pharmacy Merchandise"); (c) sell
freshly prepared ready-made, ready-to-eat and/or ready-to-heat meals for take-
out; and (d) perform and/or sell routine, diagnostic and prognostic
testing and screening services of the type conducted by medical laboratories
for members of the public or their pets, or takes, collects or receives
specimens or samples for such purposes ("Medical Testing Services") or
administers vaccinations or inoculations to members of the public; and 
---|--- 



     | (ii) | no business conducted on any premises in the Shopping
Center other than the Leased Premises will sell, or be permitted by Landlord
to sell, food for off-premises consumption, pet foods, Coffee Drinks,
Prescription Pharmacy Merchandise and/or freshly prepared ready-made, ready-
to-eat and/or ready-to-heat meals for take-out; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | no portion of the Shopping Center other than the Leased
Premises will be used for a business, clinic or facility that (a) performs or
sells Medical Testing Services, or (b) administers vaccinations
or inoculations to members of the public 
---|---|--- 

(all of the foregoing, the "Supermarket Covenant").

 



     | 13.2.3 | Exceptions to Supermarket Covenant. The provisions of
_Section 13.2.2_ will not be deemed to prohibit: 
---|---|--- 
 

business establishments in the Shopping Center other than the Leased Premises
may devote up to, but not more than, the lesser of (a) [ _ _]
square feet of sales area (including aisle space adjacent thereto), or (b)
sales area (including aisle space adjacent thereto) of up to [ _
_] percent of the total square footage of the business establishments
premises, to the sale of food for off-premises consumption (but no amount of
alcoholic beverages).

[Additional exceptions to be negotiated based upon specifics of project.]

 

The prohibitions contained in this _Article 13_ shall not be applicable to any
tenants of the Shopping Center under leases in place as of the Effective Date
or replacement tenants in the same leased premises operating for the uses as
existing in the Shopping Center as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_
, in all events Tenant shall have the same priority with respect to
other tenants exclusive use rights as the operator of the supermarket in the
Leased Premises has immediately prior to the Effective Date and nothing in
this Lease is intended to diminish any exclusive use rights specifically
provided for the benefit of the operator of the supermarket in the

 



\- 39 -  Leased Premises in any other agreement, instrument or document of record, to
the extent effective as of the Effective Date.

 



     | 13.2.4 | Waiver. The provision of _Section 13.2.2_ are for the
benefit of Tenant, and may be waived only by Tenant, in its sole discretion;
provided, however, the exclusive rights contained in  _Section 13.2.2_ will
terminate and be of no further force or effect, to the extent they pertain to
an Applicable Business (defined below) if, (a) the business (i.e., the sale of
food, or the sale of Coffee Drinks, or the sale of Prescription Pharmacy
Merchandise, or the sale of pet foods, or the sale of freshly prepared ready-
made, ready-to-eat and/or ready-to-heat meals for take-out or the performance
or sale of Medical Testing Services) (each, an "Applicable Business") that is
the subject of the exclusive does not commence to operate on the Leased
Premises by [ _ _] for any reason other than (i) a
strike, lockout or other labor difficulty, fire or other casualty,
condemnation, war, riot, insurrection, act of God, or any other reason beyond
the reasonable control of Tenant (other than financial), or (ii) temporary
closure due to the restoration, reconstruction, expansion, alteration or
remodeling of any buildings or improvements on the Leased Premises ("Excusable
Event"), or (b) at any time after the Applicable Business is first operated
on the Leased Premises the Applicable Business is not operated on the Leased
Premises for a continuous period of two (2) years or more for any reason other
than an Excusable Event. Such restrictions will again be effective as to any
Applicable Business which is thereafter operated on the Leased Premises, but
will be subject to any leases, assignments or subleases entered into during
the period that such restrictions were not effective. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 13.3. |

Enforcement of Use Restrictions and Competitive Business Covenant. The Parties
agree that the economic loss to Tenant resulting from a violation of
_Sections 13.1_ and _13.2_ is not readily measurable or subject to precise
calculation. Accordingly, in the event of a violation of any of the provisions
of _Sections 13.1_ and _13.2_ , which violation is not corrected within
thirty (30) days after Tenant provides Notice thereof to Landlord, then, in
addition to Tenants right to seek other remedies as provided in _Section
16.5_, Tenants obligation to pay Monthly Rent will be abated, as long as
such violation continues, by an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
Monthly Rent. If the violation has not been corrected within one hundred
eighty (180) days after Tenant provides Notice to Landlord, then Tenant may
terminate this Lease by providing Notice thereof to Landlord. Landlord and
Tenant agree that, in any lawsuit by Tenant seeking injunctive relief as a
result of a violation of the terms of _Section 13.2.2_, the harm suffered by
Tenant by reason of a breach of _Section 13.2.2_ will be deemed to be
irreparable for which Tenant does not have an adequate remedy at law. Tenant
will not be required to post a bond or other security in any action seeking to
enforce the  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 40 - remedy. Tenant may enforce its rights under _Sections 13.1_ and _13.2_ against
the owner, tenant, or occupant of any business on any premises in the
Shopping Center that violates Tenants rights under _Sections 13.1_ and
_13.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not enforce its Monthly
Rent abatement and Lease termination rights for a period of twelve (12)
months from the date of Tenants Notice to Landlord if (i) the violation was
not consented to by Landlord or otherwise not the result of Landlords Willful
Violation (defined in _Section 13.3.1_), and (ii) upon delivery of Tenants
Notice, Landlord immediately commences and diligently prosecutes Appropriate
Action (defined in _Section 13.3.1_) (including legal proceedings) to cause
the violation to cease.  
---|--- 



     | 13.3.1 | Willful Violation. For purposes of _Section 13.2.4_, a
"Willful Violation" by Landlord shall include the sale, lease or license of
any other portion of the Shopping Center without obtaining an express
contractual agreement by the buyer, tenant or licensee to honor the provisions
of _Section 13.2_, or language with an equivalent result, or Landlords
consent to the violation of any of the provisions of  _Section 13.2_ by
another party. "Appropriate Action" shall include, among other actions,
enjoining the conduct of such violator in violation of such violators lease
or promptly terminating the violators lease if the violation was not
consented to by Landlord or otherwise not the result of Landlords Willful
Violation (after applicable notice and cure periods as provided in such lease)
if the violator refuses to desist from its violation and diligently
prosecuting an injunctive action or an unlawful detainer action. 
---|---|--- 



   14. | NO COVENANT TO OPERATE. 
---|--- 



     | 14.1. | Right to Discontinue Business. Landlord agrees that (i)
Tenant, its subtenants or assignees will not be obligated to operate any
particular type of business in the Leased Premises and will have the right
to discontinue whatever type of business (supermarket or otherwise) which may
exist from time to time in the Leased Premises, and (ii) Tenant makes no
express or implied covenant (a) to continuously operate a supermarket or any
other business in the Leased Premises, (b) to operate during any particular
hours, or (c) to conduct its business in any particular manner. Tenant has the
sole right in its unrestricted discretion to decide whether or not to operate
in the Leased Premises and in what manner to conduct operations, if any.
However, if Tenant elects to cease operations within the Leased Premises,
Tenant shall endeavor to give Landlord as a courtesy only, prior written
notice of Tenants intention to discontinue operations. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.2. | Landlords Right to Recapture Leased Premises. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.2.1 |

Recapture Right. If (i) the operation of all or substantially all of the
business in the Leased Premises is discontinued for a continuous period of 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 41 - under subparts (a) and (b) below, or (ii) at any time prior to the expiration
of the Original Term of this Lease, less than fifty percent (50%) of the
sales area of the Leased Premises is being used for a grocery supermarket
(which may include drug store/pharmacy) and uses incidental thereto for a
continuous period of nine (9) months or more for reasons other than as
permitted under subparts (a) and (b) below, Landlord may terminate this Lease,
provided, however, to the extent that Tenant has sublet portions of the Leased
Premises as permitted in this Lease and the subtenant has not caused the
failure to use at least fifty percent (50%) of the sales area of the Leased
Premises for a grocery supermarket (which may include drug store/pharmacy) and
uses incidental thereto, and the subtenant is not in default beyond
any applicable cure period under the sublease, the sublease shall survive and
become a direct lease between Landlord and the subtenant. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Landlord may not terminate this Lease if and to the extent the
cessation of business or failure to comply with such a condition of Transfer
occurs by reason of: (a) Force Majeure, or (b) temporary closure due to the
restoration, reconstruction, expansion, alteration or remodeling of the Leased
Premises. Any election by Landlord to terminate this Lease pursuant to this
_Section 14.2_ must be made by Notice to Tenant (the "Recapture Notice")
given within thirty (30) days after the end of the nine (9) month period of
discontinued operations or of failure to use at least fifty percent (50%) of
the sales area of the Leased Premises for a grocery supermarket (which may
include drug store/pharmacy), and uses incidental thereto, as the case may be. 
---|--- 
 



     | 14.2.2 | Effective Termination Date. If Landlord properly
terminates this Lease in accordance this _Section 14.2_, then, such
termination will be effective thirty (30) days following Tenants receipt of
the Recapture Notice to provide Tenant with thirty (30) days to remove its
trade fixtures, equipment, signs, inventory and other property from the Leased
Premises. 
---|---|--- 
 



   15. | TRANSFER OF INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF SUCCESSORS. 
---|--- 



     | 15.1. | Landlords Transfer. If Landlord sells the Shopping Center
and/or assigns Landlords interest in this Lease and Landlords successor in
interest assumes all of Landlords obligations under this Lease, then the
purchaser at such sale or transfer or any subsequent sale or transfer of the
Shopping Center, will be deemed, without any further agreement between the
Parties or their successors in interest or between the Parties and any
such purchaser, to have assumed and agreed to carry out any and all of the
covenants and obligations of the Landlord under this Lease after the
consummation of such sale. Landlord will be released from all obligations
under this Lease, not accrued as of the date of such sale or transfer, upon
providing Tenant with Notice of such sale or assignment, accompanied by a copy
of the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer (together, the "Sale
Notice"). 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 42 - assignee, transferee or purchaser of Landlords interest in this Lease in
accordance with _Section 15.1_ from and after the date Tenant receives the
Sale Notice in the same manner and with the same force and effect as though
this Lease were made in the first instance by and between the Tenant and such
assignee, transferee or purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.3. | Tenants Transfer. Tenant may assign this Lease or sublet
the whole or any part of the Leased Premises (a "Transfer"), provided that
Landlord has consented to such Transfer. Landlords consent to any Transfer
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. A refusal by
Landlord to consent to a Transfer based on the transferees proposed use of
the Leased Premises shall be deemed to be unreasonable, if such use complies
with _Section 3.2._ of this Lease, except that during the Original Term of
this Lease it shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to consent on the
condition that, following the Transfer and continuing for the balance of
the Original Term of this Lease, at least fifty percent (50%) of the sales
area of the Leased Premises will be used for a grocery supermarket (which may
include drug store/pharmacy) and uses incidental thereto. If Tenant assigns
this Lease, Tenant will remain liable as a surety to Landlord for full
performance of Tenants obligations hereunder provided that Landlord gives
Tenant (i) Notice of any further assignment of this Lease and (ii) Notice of
any default by Tenants assignee or any subsequent assignee of the tenants
interest under this Lease concurrently with the giving of such Notice to such
assignee, and if the default is capable of being cured by the payment of
money, the opportunity to cure the default within the same and concurrent
period of time as such assignee has under this Lease. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.3.1 | Permitted Transfers. The following are permitted
Transfers and will not be subject to Landlords consent (collectively,
"Permitted Transfers"): (i) a Transfer to an entity that controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with Tenant; (ii) a Transfer to an
entity that acquires substantially all of the stock or assets of Tenant in the
greater [ _city, state_ ] area; (iii) a Transfer to any successor by merger
to Tenant, (iv) a Transfer to any partnership, limited liability company or
trust, the majority interest of which is owned by Tenant or a parent,
subsidiary or affiliated corporation of Tenant; (v) Transfer to a party that
intends to operate a supermarket in the Leased Premises; (vi) Transfer to a
party who intends to operate a drug store in the Leased Premises, provided at
least fifty percent (50%) of the sales area of the Leased Premises will be
used for a grocery supermarket (which may include drug store/pharmacy) and
uses incidental thereto after the Transfer, or (vii) so long as Tenant is
operating a supermarket in a portion of the Leased Premises, any sublease,
license, concession or other occupancy agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.4. |

Rights of Successors. Each and all of the covenants, terms, agreements, rights
and obligations of the Parties under this Lease will extend to and bind and
inure to 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 43 - representatives, successors and assigns. 
---|--- 



   16. | DEFAULT. 
---|--- 



     | 16.1. | Tenants Default. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.1 | Non-monetary Default. If Tenant breaches any covenant or
agreement under this Lease other than the covenant to pay Monthly Rent or to
pay or reimburse Landlord other sums of money, and if Tenant fails to
cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlords Notice
specifying the breach or, if the breach is of a type that requires more than
thirty (30) days to cure and Tenant fails to use reasonable diligence in
curing such breach, then Tenant will be in default of this Lease and Landlord
may pursue all remedies available under this Lease, at law or in equity,
including the right to obtain specific performance; except Landlord cannot
declare a forfeiture of or terminate this Lease, or prohibit or restrict
Tenants use or enjoyment of the Leased Premises, on account of such default
(other than a violation by Tenant of restrictions in this Lease on the
permitted use of the Leased Premises). However, if Tenant, in good faith,
disputes the existence of an alleged breach, and identifies the nature of the
dispute by providing Notice to Landlord within fifteen (15) days after
Tenants receipt of Landlords Notice, then the thirty (30) day period will
not begin until the dispute is settled by an arbitration decision, a court
decree or the mutual agreement of the Parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.1.2 | Monetary Default. If Tenant breaches its obligation to
pay Monthly Rent or reimburse Landlord other sums of money due under this
Lease (a "Monetary Breach") and the breach continues for ten (10) days after
Tenants receipt of Landlords Notice specifying the breach, then Tenant will
be in default of this Lease and Landlord, so long as the breach continues, may
pursue any remedies available under this Lease, at law or in equity. However,
if Tenant, in good faith, disputes the existence of an alleged breach or the
amount due, and identifies the nature of the dispute by Notice provided to
Landlord within ten (10) days after Tenants receipt of Landlords Notice,
and all undisputed amounts are paid, then the ten (10) day period will not
begin until the dispute is settled by an arbitration decision, a court decree
or the mutual agreement of the Parties.

     | 16.1.2.1 |

Remedies for Monetary Breach. If Tenant fails to cure a Monetary Breach within
the ten (10) day cure period prescribed by  _Section 16.1.2_ (as the same
may be extended pursuant to that Section), then Landlord may, in 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 44 - take possession of the Leased Premises and expel Tenant and any other persons
occupying the Leased Premises. Upon any such reentry Landlord may either: (i)
terminate this Lease by giving Notice to Tenant or (ii) from time to time and
without terminating this Lease, relet the Leased Premises or any part thereof
for such term (which may be for a term extending beyond the Term) and at such
rental and upon such other terms and conditions as are reasonably determined
by Landlord, provided Landlord uses commercially reasonable efforts to relet
the Leased Premises if required by applicable law. 
---|--- 
 



     | 16.1.2.1.1. | Reletting. In the event of any such uncured default
by Tenant, and Landlord elects to relet the Leased Premises, Tenant will be
liable to Landlord for the reasonable and necessary costs and expenses of
such reletting (including customary brokers commissions, reasonable
attorneys fees and advertising costs), together with the costs of any
alterations and repairs reasonably necessary to effect such reletting, all
such expenses amortized over the term of the new lease and the amount, if
any, by which the Monthly Rent reserved in this Lease for the period of such
reletting (but not beyond the Original Term or Extension Term, if any, in
effect) exceeds the amount agreed to be paid as rent for the Leased Premises
for the period of reletting or which Tenant proves would have been payable had
Landlord exercised reasonable diligence in reletting the Leased Premises. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 16.1.2.1.2. | Termination. If Landlord elects to terminate this
Lease, then Landlord will be entitled to recover from Tenant: 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 45 - (a) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid Monthly Rent which had been
earned at the time of such termination; plus

(b) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Monthly
Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award
exceeds the amount of fair market rental for the same time period, discounted
as provided under [ ] law; plus

 

(c) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Monthly
Rent for the balance of the then-existing Term (excluding any unexercised
Extension Terms) after the time of award exceeds the fair market rental for
the same time period, discounted as provided under [ _state_ ] law.

 

As used in _subsections (a)_ and _(b)_ above, the "worth at the time of
award" is computed by allowing interest at the rate prescribed by _Section
16.4_. As used in _subsection (c)_ above, the "worth at the time of award" is
computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the [Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco] at the time of award plus one percent (1%).



     | 16.1.2.2 | Notice to Terminate. No reentry of the Leased Premises
by Landlord pursuant to _Section 16.1_, and no acceptance of surrender of the
Leased Premises or other action on Landlords part, will be construed as an
election to terminate this Lease unless Tenant receives a Notice of such
intention from Landlord or unless the termination is decreed by a court of
competent jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 16.1.2.3 |

Lease Continues in Effect. If Landlord elects not to reenter the Leased
Premises, this Lease will continue in effect and Landlord may enforce all its
rights and 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 46 - Monthly Rent as it becomes due. 
---|--- 



     | 16.2. | Landlords Default. If Landlord breaches any covenant or
agreement under this Lease and the breach continues for thirty (30) days after
Landlords receipt of Tenants Notice specifying the breach or, if the breach
is of a type that requires more than thirty (30) days to cure and Landlord
fails to use reasonable diligence in curing such breach, then Landlord will be
in default of this Lease and Tenant, so long as the default continues, may
pursue all remedies available under this Lease, at law or in equity, including
the right to obtain specific performance. Tenant also may elect to take such
action, and make and incur any reasonable expenses, as may be necessary
to cure such default on behalf of Landlord and Landlord will pay or reimburse
Tenant such expenses upon receipt of Tenants demand (which demand will be
accompanied by documentation evidencing the expenses). If Landlord fails to
pay or reimburse Tenant for such expenses within fifteen (15) days after
Landlord receives Tenants demand, or if Landlord fails to reimburse Tenant
for any other amount owing under this Lease within fifteen (15) days after
Landlord receives Tenants demand, then Tenant may deduct the amount which
Landlord has failed to reimburse from any sums payable by Tenant under this
Lease. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.3. | Tenants Notice to Mortgagee; Landlords Notice to
Assignees. Upon notifying Landlord of its breach of this Lease pursuant to
_Section 16.2_, Tenant will simultaneously provide Notice to all mortgagees
or trust deed beneficiaries of record to whom Landlord has previously
requested Tenant provide such Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give any such Notice to mortgagees or trust deed beneficiaries will
not invalidate any Notice provided by Tenant to Landlord. Such mortgagee or
trust deed beneficiary will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure
such breach on behalf of Landlord as provided in _Section 16.2_. Landlord
agrees that upon notifying Tenants assignee of its breach of this Lease
pursuant to _Sections 16.1.1_ and _16.1.2_ , Landlord will simultaneously give
Notice to Tenant. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 16.4. | Interest. In the event of breach of this Lease by either
Party hereunder which continues beyond the period of time to cure such breach,
any amount due from the breaching Party or expended by the other Party
to cure the breach of the breaching Party will bear interest at the rate of
ten percent (10%) per year or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is
lower, from the date such amount was due from the breaching Party or was
expended by the curing Party, until paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | 16.5. | Remedies Cumulative. Except as may be expressly provided
otherwise in this Lease, no remedy conferred upon or reserved to Landlord or
Tenant in this Lease will exclude any other remedy herein or by law
provided, but each will be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy
given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by
statute. 
---|---|--- 



   17. | CASUALTY. 
---|--- 
 



\- 47 - fire, the elements or other casualty, regardless of whether such Casualty is
insured (collectively, a "Casualty"), Tenant, at Tenants sole cost and
expense, will promptly repair all damage and restore Tenants Building to
substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty
(subject to _Section 17.3_). Tenant shall commence the permitting and repair
process promptly and shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the repair
and/or restoration (collectively, the "Repairs") within 270 days after the
occurrence of such Casualty, provided, however, that Tenant shall not be in
default under this _Section 17.1_ if Tenant fails to complete the repair
and/or restoration within this period, so long as Tenant is proceeding
diligently, using all reasonable efforts, to complete the repair
and/or restoration. Landlord shall have the right to inspect and monitor
Tenants Repairs to confirm compliance with original plans and specifications
for Tenants Building as well as compliance with applicable laws. Landlord
shall not have approval rights thereover so long as Tenants Building is
rebuilt (i) to the same footprint of Tenants Building existing immediately
prior to the Casualty, and (ii) in accordance with the plans and
specifications for Tenants Building which were originally used when Tenants
Building was first constructed. All Repairs shall be done in a good and
workmanlike and lien-free manner and Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord and Landlords lender harmless from and against all claims, loss,
liens, damage and costs arising from or related to such Repairs. Furthermore,
Tenant shall obtain (and deliver to Landlord copies of) (i) unconditional lien
waivers from any general contractor and all subcontractors and material
suppliers whose work exceeds $[25,000], (ii) construction contracts relating
to such Repairs, (iii) close-out manuals and warranties relating to such
Repairs, (iv) copies of all change orders, and (v) copies of all third party
certificates and inspections performed in connection with such Repairs (and
Tenant shall insure that any such certificates or third party reports prepared
in connection with such Repairs are also certified to Landlord and Landlords
lender). 
---|---|--- 



     | 17.2. | Abatement or Reduction in Rent. In no event shall any
Casualty result in a reduction or abatement of rent payable under this Lease. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 17.3. | Rebuilding to New Prototype. If in connection with the
Repairs, Tenant elects to rebuild or restore Tenants Building to Tenants
then-standard prototype, then all of the provisions of  _Section 17.1_ shall
control, except Landlord shall have approval rights (not to be unreasonably
withheld) over any and all such Repairs (e.g. the rebuild and restoration),
including, without limitation, the plans and specifications.  
---|---|--- 



     | 17.4. | Damage by Casualty  Shopping Center. If any portions of
the Common Area or the buildings in the Shopping Center other than Tenants
Building are damaged by a Casualty, then Landlord will promptly repair all
damage and restore the Common Area and/or the buildings to the same condition
as existed immediately prior to the Casualty. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 48 - ---|---|--- 



     | 17.5.1 | Damage to Leased Premises. If the Leased Premises are
damaged by a Casualty during the last year of the Term, and such Casualty
results in damage exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the then-current
replacement cost of the Leased Premises then either Landlord or Tenant may
terminate this Lease as of the date of the damage by providing Notice thereof
to the other within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the
Casualty, provided, however, that Tenant may elect to exercise any available
option to extend the Term, in which case neither Party shall have a right to
terminate this Lease pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 17.5_ and
any prior effort to terminate shall be nullified. Upon such termination, all
insurance proceeds paid and payable shall be the sole and exclusive property
of Landlord and may be used by Landlord as Landlord deems appropriate in its
sole discretion. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 17.5.2 | Inability to Obtain Necessary Permits. Notwithstanding
_Sections 17.1_ and _17.2_ , the Party undertaking the repair and restoration
of the Leased Premises or Shopping Center, as applicable (the "Responsible
Party") will not be in default of its obligations under _Sections 17.1_ and
_17.2_ if it does not repair or restore because it cannot obtain, despite its
diligent best efforts, the governmental permits or governmental approvals
necessary to repair or restore; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event
the Responsible Party will remove all debris and landscape the affected area
or convert the same into a paved parking area (in either case compatible with
the quality and design of the balance of the Shopping Center) for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the tenants and customers of the Shopping Center; and
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that that the other Party will have the
right to attempt to obtain the governmental permits and approvals if the
Responsible Party is unable to do so. If the Leased Premises cannot be
repaired and restored to substantially the same condition as existed
immediately prior to the Casualty (or as otherwise reasonably desired by
Tenant pursuant _Section 17.3_) due to the unavailability of governmental
permits or governmental approvals, then Tenant may terminate this Lease as of
the date of the Casualty by providing Notice to Landlord within 30 days after
the determination that the Leased Premises cannot be so restored. 
---|---|--- 



     | 17.5.3 |

Damage to Common Area. If more than 25% of the Common Area of the Shopping
Center has been substantially damaged and within sixty (60) days of the date
of the Casualty ("Assurance Deadline") Landlord does not notify Tenant in
writing that the Common Area will be reconstructed within one (1) year to  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 49 - to such Casualty, or if Landlord is unable within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the date of the Casualty ("Permit Deadline") to obtain all
governmental permits and approvals necessary to repair or restore the Common
Area to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to such
Casualty, then Tenant may terminate this Lease as of the date of the Casualty
by providing Notice to Landlord within 30 days after the Assurance Deadline
(if the above described reasonable assurance of reconstruction is not
previously given) or the Permits Deadline (if the above described permits
and approvals are not previously obtained). 
---|--- 



   18. | CONDEMNATION. 
---|--- 



     | 18.1. | Taking or Damage by Condemnation. If any portion of or
interest in the Shopping Center excluding the Leased Premises will be taken or
damaged under any right of eminent domain or any transfer in lieu
thereof, unless this Lease is terminated as provided in _Section 18.2_,
Landlord will promptly restore the Shopping Center to an architectural unit as
nearly comparable as practicable to the unit existing just prior to the taking
or damage. If any portion of or interest in the Leased Premises will be taken
or damaged under any right or eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof,
unless this Lease is terminated as provided in _Section 18.2_, Tenant will
promptly restore the Leased Premises to as nearly comparable as practicable
to the same condition as existed immediately prior to the taking or damage.
The foregoing obligation is contingent, however, upon such condemnation award
being actually paid to Landlord or Tenant, as applicable, for such
restoration. Furthermore, all of the provisions of _Sections 17.1_ and _17.4_
shall control as if such taking was in fact a Casualty. In no event shall any
taking or transfer in lieu thereof result in a reduction or abatement of rent
payable under this Lease; provided, however, if any portion of Tenants
Building is so taken but this Lease is not terminated, then Tenants Monthly
Rent shall be reduced by in the same percentage as the reduction in the
square feet of Floor Area of Tenants Building due to such taking.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 18.1_,
Tenant shall have the right to make a claim for the loss of easement
rights in connection with any exercise of eminent domain or transfer in lieu
thereof of all or any portion of the Access Road. 
---|---|--- 



     | 18.2. |

Termination Right. If any portion of or interest in the Shopping Center or
Leased Premises will be taken or damaged under any right of eminent domain or
any transfer in lieu thereof, and such taking or damage either (i) materially
and permanently prevents access to the Leased Premises from a public right-of-
way, or (ii) takes more than 10% of the Tenants Building, then Tenant may
terminate this Lease by providing Notice thereof to Landlord within thirty
(30) days after such taking or damage deprives Tenant of possession of any
portion of the Leased Premises or of any other rights of Tenant under this
Lease. Nothing contained 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 50 - claims in any condemnation proceedings for the values of their respective
interests. 
---|--- 
 



     | 18.3. | Condemnation Proceeds. In the event of any condemnation
and whether or not Tenant elects to terminate this Lease, Tenant shall be
entitled to any and all awards or payments made in the condemnation
proceedings with respect to any damage to (i) any improvements located on the
Leased Premises (to the extent same have not been purchased and paid for by
Landlord) together with all additions, alterations and improvements thereto,
(ii) Tenants trade fixtures and equipment, and (iii) Tenants loss of
business. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Landlord and Tenant from
prosecuting claims in any condemnation proceedings for the value of all of
their respective interests. However, the provisions of this _Section 18.3_
are not to be deemed to be in lieu of any of the other rights granted to
Tenant under this _Section 18_. 
---|---|--- 
 



   19. | TENANTS PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS TO PURCHASE AND LEASE. 
---|--- 



     | 19.1. | Pre-emptive Right to Purchase. Landlord hereby grants to
Tenant, its successors and assigns, a right to purchase all or any portion of
the Shopping Center ("Offer Property") on the following terms and conditions:
Before Landlord solicits one or more offers, or accepts an offer, for the
purchase of the Offer Property, or communicates an offer for the sale of the
Offer Property, in each case whether or not as part of a package
including other property, Landlord shall first make a written offer to Tenant
to sell the Offer Property to Tenant. Such offer shall include the sale price
and all other material terms of the proposed sale and purchase of the Offer
Property (the "Offer"). Tenant shall have a period of thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Offer to accept such Offer by written notice to
Landlord. If Tenant does not accept the Offer in writing and Landlord and
Tenant cannot otherwise agree in writing on other mutually acceptable terms
of the sale and purchase of the Offer Property within such thirty (30) day
period, Landlord shall thereafter be free to sell the Offer Property to any
third party, provided that, before agreeing to sell the Offer Property to a
third party (i) for a sale price that is more than 5% less than the sale price
in the Offer, and/or (ii) on other terms that are materially more favorable
than those offered to Tenant, Landlord shall again offer to sell the Offer
Property to Tenant for such sale price and on such more favorable terms, as
applicable (the "Modified Offer"), and Tenant shall have a period of fifteen
(15) days following receipt of the Modified Offer to accept such offer by
written notice to Landlord. The foregoing right to purchase the Offer Property
shall terminate upon the sale of the Offer Property by Landlord to a third
party after Tenant fails or refuses to timely exercise its right to purchase
the Offer Property as provided herein, based on the Offer or, if applicable,
any Modified Offer. Upon Landlords request after Tenants right to purchase
the Offer Property has terminated, Tenant shall execute and deliver to
Landlord, in recordable form, a certificate reciting that such right has
terminated.

event prior notice will not be required and also except that 24 hour prior
Notice shall not be required to enter the Common Area portion of the Leased
Premises), for the purpose of inspecting the Leased Premises and performing
its obligations under this Lease, provided that such entry will not interfere
with Tenants use and enjoyment of the Leased Premises. During the last six
(6) months of the Term, Landlord will be permitted to affix to or keep on
Tenants Building on the Leased Premises "to let" or "for sale" notices and
will be permitted to show the Tenants Building on the Leased Premises during
business hours to prospective tenants or purchasers. Showing the Leased

minimum of interference with the business of Tenant, its assignees and
subtenants.

and nothing contained in this Lease will, create any partnership, joint
venture or other joint or equity type agreement between Landlord and Tenant.  
---|---|--- 



     | 21.7. |

status of Landlords title and to establish the priority of this Lease,
Landlord and Tenant, simultaneously with the execution of this Lease, will
execute a 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 53 - of _Exhibit D_ which shall be recorded by Tenant promptly following the
execution thereof and the cost of such recording and any transfer or
conveyance fees incurred in connection therewith or in connection with the
leasing of the Leased Premises to Tenant shall be shared equally by Landlord
and Tenant. 
---|--- 
 



     | 21.8. | No Third Party Beneficiaries Intended. No term or
provision of this Lease is intended to be, or is, for the benefit of any
person, firm, organization, or corporation not a party hereto, and no such
other person, firm, organization or corporation will have any right or cause
of action hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.9. | Invalid Provisions. If any term or provision of this Lease
or any portion of a term or provision hereof or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance will, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Lease, or the application of such term or provision or
portion thereof to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is
held invalid or unenforceable, will not be affected thereby, and each term and
provision of this Lease and each portion thereof will be valid and be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.10. | Non-Disclosure. Landlord and Tenant agree that the terms
of this Lease are confidential and constitute proprietary information of the
Parties. Each of the Parties agrees that, except as permitted below,
such Party, and its respective partners, officers, directors, and attorneys,
will not disclose the terms and conditions of this Lease to any other person
without the prior approval of the other Party except pursuant to an order of a
court of competent jurisdiction. However, either Party may disclose the terms
of this Lease to its lenders or prospective lenders or its respective
attorneys and accountants and to any prospective transferee of all or any
portions of their respective interests hereunder (including a prospective
assignee or subtenant of Tenant with whom it has entered into negotiations for

the recipient of the confidential nature of the information and obtains such
recipients agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of this
Lease. Either Party may also disclose the terms of this Lease to any
governmental entity, agency or person to whom disclosure is required by
applicable law, regulation or duty of diligent inquiry and in connection with
any action brought to enforce the terms of this Lease, on account of the
breach or alleged breach hereof or to seek a judicial determination of the
rights or obligations of the Parties hereunder. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that remedies at law are an inadequate remedy for breach of this
_Section 21.10_ and that as a result either Party will be entitled to obtain
specific performance of the provisions of this _Section 21.10_ and
injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach thereof without
actual damages.

Party, or (ii) the exercise of a right hereunder by either Party, falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 54 - in the state where the Landlord or Tenant has its principal place of business,
the time for performance of such obligation, or exercise of such right, will
be deemed extended until the next business day following such date. 
---|--- 



     | 21.12. | Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in this Lease
and each and every term, condition and provision hereof. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.13. | Entire Agreement and Modification. It is agreed that once
this Lease is fully executed and delivered that it contains the entire
agreement between the Parties hereto and that, in executing it, the Parties do
not rely upon any statement, promise, or representation not herein expressed
and this Lease once executed and delivered will not be modified, changed or
altered in any respect except by a writing executed and delivered in the same
manner as required for this Lease. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.14. | Waiver of Landlords Lien. Landlord agrees that none of
the property, including food, supplies, merchandise, inventory, furniture,
trade fixtures, machinery, equipment, cash, or any proceeds from
such property, that is located in Tenants Building and/or Tenants
Facilities, whether owned by Tenant or third parties, is subject to a
contractual landlords lien or any other liens created in favor of Landlord
pursuant to Law for the collection of rent. All such property will remain
under the possession and control of Tenant during the Term and may be removed
by Tenant, at Tenants discretion, from time to time during and after the Term
of this Lease. Landlord agrees, upon request by Tenant, to sign and deliver
such documents and/or instruments evidencing the waiver of any such lien to
any bank, other lending institution or third party. Landlord agrees to execute
said documents within fifteen (15) days of the time originally requested by
Tenant. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.15. | Standard for Parties Consent. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Lease, whenever a Partys consent, approval,
judgment or discretion is required under this Lease, the Party will
not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent, approval, judgment
or discretion. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.16. | No Waiver. The failure of Landlord or Tenant to insist in
any one or more cases upon the performance of any of the provisions,
covenants, agreements or conditions of this Lease or to exercise any option
herein contained will not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment for
the future of any such provision, covenant, agreement, condition or option. No
waiver of any provision, covenant, agreement or condition of this Lease will
be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by the
Party against whom such waiver is charged. The express waiver by either
Landlord or Tenant of any breach will not operate to extinguish the covenant
or condition, the breach of which has been waived. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.17. | Governing Law. This Lease will be governed and enforced
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of [ _
_].  
---|---|--- 
 



\- 55 - counsel to bring an action at law or in equity, for arbitration or other
proceedings against the other Party to enforce any of the provisions of this
Lease, or for a declaration interpreting any of the provisions of this Lease,
then the unsuccessful Party will pay to the prevailing Party a reasonable sum
for attorneys fees. Attorneys fees will include attorneys fees on any
appeal, and in addition a Party entitled to attorneys fees will be entitled
to all other reasonable costs for investigating such action, taking
depositions and other discovery, travel, and all other necessary costs

Collateral and make it available to Beneficiary at the Property. Trustor shall
pay to Beneficiary on written demand any and all expenses, including actual

hereunder with respect to the Collateral. Any notice of sale, disposition or
other intended action by Beneficiary with respect to the Collateral sent to
Trustor at the address in the introductory paragraph to this Deed of Trust at

commercially reasonable notice to Trustor. The proceeds of any disposition of
the Collateral, or any part thereof, shall, except as otherwise required by
law or the other Loan Documents, be applied by Beneficiary in accordance with
