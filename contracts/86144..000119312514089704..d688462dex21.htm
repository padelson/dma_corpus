the Company that irrespective of this Agreement (or any other potential acquisition of stock of the Company) the Company intends to consummate and would consummate the Blackhawk Spin-Off. For the avoidance of doubt, the Opinions shall not rely on
representations stating solely that the Blackhawk Spin-Off does not violate the &#147;device&#148; prohibition of Section&nbsp;355(a)(1)(B) of the Code or that the Blackhawk Spin-Off satisfies the &#147;business purpose&#148; requirement applicable

is situated (the &#147;UCC&#148;) and other applicable law and with respect to any other portions of the Property subject to the UCC (the &#147;<U>Collateral</U>&#148;). The Property includes both real and personal property and all other rights and

and all other Property which is personal property to secure the payment of the indebtedness and performance of the obligations under the Loan Agreement, and agrees that Beneficiary shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the
UCC with respect to such property including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the right to take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, and to take such other measures as Beneficiary may deem reasonably necessary for the
care, protection and preservation of the Collateral. Upon written request or written demand of Beneficiary, Trustor shall at its expense assemble the Collateral and make it available to Beneficiary at the Property. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary
on written demand any and all expenses, including actual reasonable legal expenses and attorneys&#146; fees, incurred or paid by Beneficiary in protecting the interest in the Collateral and in enforcing the rights hereunder with respect to the
Collateral. Any notice of sale, disposition or other intended action by Beneficiary with respect to the Collateral sent to Trustor at the address in the introductory paragraph to this Deed of Trust at least ten (10)&nbsp;business days prior to such
