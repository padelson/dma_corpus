 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") entered into as of
January 9, 2007, by and among INTERNATIONAL ALUMINUM CORPORATION, a
California corporation (the " _Company_ "), IAC HOLDING CO., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and IAL ACQUISITION CO., a
California corporation (" _Merger Subsidiary_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, and
Merger Subsidiary have each determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined below),
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective
shareholders, and have each approved the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and
into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the " _Merger_ "); and

  

WHEREAS, as a condition and an inducement to the willingness of Parent to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have
concurrently herewith entered into Support Agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (" _Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which, among other things, such shareholders have agreed to vote the shares
of Company Common Stock (as defined below) owned by them in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

# **ARTICLE I**

  

# **THE MERGER; CLOSING**

  

## SECTION 1.01   _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02) Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the
California General Corporation Law (the " _CGCL_ ").  Upon the Merger, the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall continue its existence under the CGCL.

  

## SECTION 1.02   _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, the Merger shall become effective at
or following the Closing (as defined in Section 1.08) upon the filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of California (the " _Secretary of State_
") of an agreement of merger and certificates of officers of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary in accordance with the requirements of the CGCL (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). When used in this Agreement, the term "
_Effective Time_ " means the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger
is accepted by the Secretary of State for filing, or such later time as shall
be set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

  

## SECTION 1.03   _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided for in this Agreement and in Section 1107 of the CGCL.

     

   

## SECTION 1.04   _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the parties or the holders
of any of the following securities:

  



  

### (a) each issued and outstanding share of the Companys common stock, par
value $1.00 per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), owned by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment or consideration shall be made with respect thereto;

  

### (b) each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock other than
shares of Company Common Stock referred to in paragraph (a) above and other
than any Dissenting Shares **** (as defined in Section 1.05) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to $53.00 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest; and

  

### (c) each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger
Subsidiary shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## SECTION 1.05   _Dissenting Shares_. (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Dissenting Shares_ " means shares of the Company Common Stock held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by a shareholder who did not vote in
favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and with respect to which
demand to the Company for purchase of such shares is duly made and perfected
in accordance with Section 1301 of the CGCL and not subsequently and
effectively withdrawn or forfeited. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 1.04(b) or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time, but
shall entitle the holder thereof to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due to holders pursuant to the CGCL, unless and until
the holder of such Dissenting Shares withdraws his or her demand for such
appraisal in accordance with the CGCL or becomes ineligible for such
appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw his or her demand
for such appraisal or shall become ineligible for such appraisal (through
failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting
Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section
1.04(b) and in accordance with the CGCL.

  

## (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

     

   

## SECTION 1.06   _Payment of Merger Consideration_. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as disbursing agent (the " _Disbursing
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Disbursing Agent in trust for the benefit of the Companys shareholders cash
in an aggregate amount necessary to make the payments pursuant to Section
1.04(b) to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Disbursing Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund, as the Surviving Corporation directs,
in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which
the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of all principal and interest or commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies,
or money market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing,
provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as provided in
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Disbursing Agent to mail to each individual, corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, association, joint venture, unincorporated
organization, trust or any other entity, including a governmental authority
(each a " _Person_ "), who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ "), and whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.04, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the
Disbursing Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate multiplied by
the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.06, each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock owned by any subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
any other subsidiary of Parent and shares of Company Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company, which shall have been canceled as provided in
Section 1.04(a), and

     

   

other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
cash multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by
such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable
law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such
Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this
Article I. At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time the
stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.

  

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article I.

  

(e) At any time more than six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Disbursing Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Disbursing Agent
and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all interest and
other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all such funds).
Thereafter, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall look only to
Parent (subject to the terms of this Agreement and abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon
surrender of the Certificates held by them. If any Certificates shall not
have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency),
the payment in respect of such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share
of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such share of Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  

(f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to a holder of shares of

     

   

Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

## SECTION 1.07   _Treatment of Stock Options_.

  

### (a) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Option (as defined in Section 4.02) to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall constitute
only the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration (as
defined below) for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the
Option. As of the Effective Time, any Option with an exercise price greater
than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled without consideration and be
of no further force or effect. After the Effective Time, the holders (the "
_Option Holders_ ") of Options shall receive in exchange for their Options
consideration at a price (the " _Option Consideration_ ") equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under
such Option multiplied by (ii) the difference between the Merger
Consideration and the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
purchasable under such Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
or Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Option Consideration otherwise payable such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

  

### (b) In the event any stock option agreement or other instrument
evidencing the Options to be purchased pursuant to Section 1.07(a) shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery to Parent of an
affidavit, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to such
effect by the Person claiming to be the owner of the Options evidenced by
such lost, stolen or destroyed agreement or instrument, and provided that the
Companys records indicate that such Person is the owner of the Options
evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed agreement or instrument, Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall pay and deliver to such
Person the Option Consideration deliverable in respect thereof in accordance
with Section 1.07(a).

  

## SECTION 1.08   _The Closing_. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Troy and Gould Professional Corporation, 1801 Century Park East,
16th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90067, commencing at 9:00 A.M., local
time, on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions set forth in Article VI or such other place and date as the
parties may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ "). As soon as
practicable following the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall
file with the Secretary of State the duly executed Certificate of Merger and
such other documents as may be required by the CGCL, and the parties shall
take all such other and further actions as may be required by law to make the
Merger effective.

     

   

# **ARTICLE II**

  

# **THE SURVIVING CORPORATION; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS**

  

## SECTION 2.01   _Articles of Incorporation_. The Articles of Incorporation
of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, unless and until amended
in accordance with applicable law and the terms of this Agreement.

Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, and each subsidiary of the Company
is duly qualified and licensed to transact business, and is in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except, in all cases,

     

   

## where the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified, licensed and in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding

fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned
directly, or indirectly through other subsidiaries, by the Company. There are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts,

of this Agreement; and

  

### (q) not agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

  

## SECTION 5.02   _Acquisition Proposals_.  (a) After the date hereof
and until the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause its and its subsidiaries respective
directors, officers and investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial

an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) and (ii) request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information relating to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries previously furnished to such Person.

  

### (b) After the date hereof and until the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce, negotiate, encourage or provide non-public or
confidential information to facilitate any inquiry that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or offer to acquire, in one or
any series of transactions with such Person (other than Parent and its
subsidiaries), any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries, but excluding sales of

the Company; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (any such transactions being referred to herein as

     

   

### an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "); or (ii) enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third
party regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information or data,
or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, with respect to, any inquiries that constitute, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction, or otherwise
knowingly facilitate any effort to attempt to make or implement any
Acquisition Transaction.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) prior
to receipt of the Company Shareholders Approval, the Company may, in
response to a bona fide written offer or proposal with respect to a potential
or proposed Acquisition Transaction (" _Acquisition Proposal_ ") from a
Person or group (a " _Potential Acquirer_ ") that was not solicited,
initiated, induced or knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 5.02
and which the Company Board of Directors determines, in good faith and after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or other financial advisor
and its outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), and only after the Company Board
of Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisor or other financial advisor and its outside legal
counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the Companys shareholders under applicable law, (A) furnish (subject to the
execution of a confidentiality agreement not materially less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 4, 2006, between the
Company Financial Advisor and Genstar Capital LLC (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ")) confidential or non-public information to, and negotiate with,
such Potential Acquirer and (B) subject to Section 5.02(e) hereof, resolve to
accept, or recommend, and, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.01(e), enter into agreements relating to, an Acquisition
Proposal as to which the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company Board of Directors
may take and disclose to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act and otherwise make
disclosures required by applicable law. In addition, it is understood
and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including Article VII),
a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a withdrawal or
modification of, or proposal by the Company Board of Directors to withdraw
or modify, the Directors Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.07), or an
approval or recommendation or neutral position with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal. It is understood and agreed that negotiations and other
activities conducted in accordance with this paragraph (c) and
Sections 5.02(d) and (e) hereof shall not constitute a violation of
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.02. The Company agrees to provide to Parent,
to the extent the Company shall not have done so previously, any information
that it is providing to any Potential Acquirer pursuant to this Section 5.02
at substantially the same time as it provides it to such other
Potential Acquirer. " _Superior Proposal_ " means a proposal to acquire,
directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, more than 50% of the equity securities of the Company or 50% or
more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on terms and conditions
which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) to be more
favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

     

   

### (d) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, indication of interest or request for non-public
information relating to the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of
Directors of the Company or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally
and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the
offeror and the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or
contact. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a current
basis of any material changes in the status of any such Acquisition Proposal,
including whether any such Acquisition Proposal has been withdrawn or
rejected.

  

### (e) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.02(c) or this Section
5.02(e), neither the Company Board of Directors, nor any committee thereof,
shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Directors Recommendation or the approval
or declaration of advisability by such Board of this Agreement and the Merger
or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, the
adoption of any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii)
cause, authorize or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principal, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or any similar agreement, with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
permitted by Section 5.02(c) above) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company Board of
Directors may withdraw or modify the Directors Recommendation, or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, based on those matters as it deems appropriate after consulting with
the Company Financial Advisor or other financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel, that taking such action is necessary to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (y) if the Company Board
of Directors receives an Acquisition Proposal that such Board determines in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company or its
subsidiaries may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e) and
concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _that_ , with respect to any termination
pursuant to clause (y), the Company shall have complied with its obligations
under this Section 5.02 since the date of this Agreement and the Company pays
Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.02 hereof concurrent with
(and as a condition of) such termination.

  

### (f) After the date hereof and until the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company after
receipt of any proposal or offer to acquire all or any substantial part of
the business, properties or capital stock of Parent, whether by merger,
purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, whether for cash, securities
or any other consideration or combination thereof and shall indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the offeror or Person and the material
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer and the financing
arrangements, if any, relating thereto.

  

## SECTION 5.03   _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to
applicable law relating to the exchange of information, the Company and its
subsidiaries shall afford to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and their
respective accountants, counsel, financial advisors, sources of

     

   

## financing and other representatives (the " _Parent Representatives_ ")
reasonable access during normal business hours with reasonable notice
throughout the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time to all of
their respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records
(including, but not limited to, Tax Returns) and, during such period, shall
furnish promptly (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed
or received by any of them pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws or filed by any of them with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) such other information
concerning its businesses, properties and personnel as Parent or Merger
Subsidiary shall reasonably request, and will use reasonable efforts to
obtain the reasonable cooperation of the Companys officers, employees,
counsel, accountants, consultants and financial advisors in connection with
the review of such other information by Parent and the Parent
Representatives. During the period from the date hereof through the earlier
of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company and
its accountants, counsel and financial advisors may obtain non-public
information concerning Parent and Merger Subsidiary.

  

(b) All nonpublic information provided to, or obtained by, a party regarding
another party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be " _Proprietary Information_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
Proprietary Information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes
within the public domain through no act of the receiving party in breach of
this Section 5.03, (ii) was in the possession of the receiving party
prior to its disclosure or transfer hereunder, (iii) is independently
developed by the receiving party, or (iv) is received from another source
without any restriction on use or disclosure through no act of the receiving
party in breach of this Section 5.03.

  

(c) Except as specifically provided herein, each party agrees that it shall
not disclose any Proprietary Information to any third party nor use any
Proprietary Information of another party for any purpose other than as may be
necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
seeking the Parent Required Statutory Approvals and the Company Required
Statutory Approvals. The parties shall each protect all Proprietary
Information with the same degree of care as it applies to protect its own
proprietary information. As used herein, the term " _third party_ " shall be
broadly interpreted to include any corporation, company, partnership or
individual.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose such Proprietary
Information to their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants,
agents and representatives who need to know such Proprietary Information in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood
that such directors, officers, consultants, agents and representatives shall
be informed by the receiving party of the confidential nature of such
Proprietary Information and will agree to be bound by the terms of this
Section 5.03), provided, that, the receiving party agrees to be responsible
for any breach of this Section 5.03 by such persons.

  

(e) The parties agree that all communications with the Company and all
requests for information related thereto will be submitted only to persons
specifically designated in writing by the Company.

     

   

(f) In the event a party is legally requested or required to disclose
Proprietary Information of the other party, the receiving party shall
promptly notify the disclosing party of such request or requirement so that
the disclosing party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive the
provisions of this Section 5.03. In the event that such protection or other
remedy is not obtained or that the disclosing party waives compliance, the
receiving party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Proprietary
Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a disclosing
party shall not be required to provide any information to any other party
which it reasonably believes it may not provide to another party by reason of
applicable law, rules or regulations, which constitutes information protected
by attorney/client privilege, or which the disclosing party or any subsidiary
is required to keep confidential by reason of Contract, agreement or
understanding with third parties.

  

## SECTION 5.04   _Notices of Certain Events._ (a) The Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable after executive officers of the Company
acquire knowledge thereof, notify Parent of: (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which consent relates to a Material Contract
or the failure of which to obtain could materially delay consummation of the
Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication from any governmental or
regulatory agency or authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Sections 4.08, 4.09 or 4.11 or
which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.02, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary agrees to give prompt notice to each other of, and to
use its reasonable best efforts to remedy, (i) the occurrence or failure to
occur of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be
expected to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate at the Effective Time unless such occurrence or
failure to occur would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be,
and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder unless such failure would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.04(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

## SECTION 5.05   _Merger Subsidiary._ Parent will take all action necessary
to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Until the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary will not carry on any
business or conduct any operations other than the execution of this
Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary
hereto.

     

   

## SECTION 5.06   _Employee Benefits_. (a) For a period of no less than one
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation
to maintain the Company Plans and the benefits to be provided to employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Company
Employees_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Employees who are
covered under a collective bargaining agreement shall be provided the
benefits that are required by such collective bargaining agreement from time
to time. No provision in this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Company Employee and this Agreement shall not be
construed so as to prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries
from having the right to terminate the employment of any employee of the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, participants
in the International Aluminum Corporation Annual Bonus Plan shall continue to
accrue bonuses under such plan in respect of the Companys fiscal year ending
June 30, 2007 in accordance with such plan as in effect on the date hereof,
and Parent shall pay or cause such bonuses to be paid to such participants in
accordance with such plan.

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.06 shall be interpreted as preventing Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Company
Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law following the expiration
of the one-year period referenced in subsection (a) above or otherwise as
required pursuant to subsection (d) below.

  

(d) Parent and the Company, in consultation with each other, shall each take
whatever commercially reasonable actions are required with respect to any
Company Plans that are or may become subject to Section 409A of the Code
including, without limitation, the adoption of amendments (including
amendments with retroactive effect) that are necessary to preserve the
intended tax treatment of the benefits provided under any Company Plans.

  

## SECTION 5.07   _Meeting of the Company s Shareholders_. The Company shall
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement take all action
necessary in accordance with the CGCL and its Restated Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws to establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, and convene a meeting of the Companys shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholders Approval and will use its reasonable best efforts (including
postponing or adjourning the Company Shareholders Meeting to obtain a quorum
or to solicit additional proxies) to obtain the Company Shareholders
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be relieved of its
obligations with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting if the Company
Board of Directors terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e) and
pays Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.02 concurrent with (and
as a condition of) such termination. Subject to Sections 5.02(c) and (e),
the Company Board of Directors shall recommend that the Companys
shareholders vote to approve this Agreement, and the Proxy Statement shall
contain the unqualified recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that
its shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Directors
 Recommendation_").

  

## SECTION 5.08   _Proxy Statement._ As promptly as practicable after
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement,
which shall, subject to Section 5.07,

     

   

## include the Directors Recommendation, and file the Proxy Statement with
the SEC under the Exchange Act and thereafter use all reasonable efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
the Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, and the Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests
by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional
information and shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC. The
Company shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its
counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and
replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to
respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC. As promptly
as practicable after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC, the
Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to the shareholders of the
Company. Prior to the date of approval of the Merger by the Companys
shareholders, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall correct
promptly any information provided by it to be used specifically in the Proxy
Statement that shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
and the Company shall take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have
cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so as
to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case to the extent
required by applicable law.

  

## SECTION 5.09   _Public Announcements_.  Neither the Company nor Parent
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may
be required by law, applicable fiduciary duties or by any applicable listing
agreement with the New York Stock Exchange (in which case such party shall
not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
statement without prior consultation with the other party).

  

## SECTION 5.10   _Expenses and Fees._ Each of the parties shall bear and
pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## SECTION 5.11   _Agreement to Cooperate._ (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Section 5.02 and this Section 5.11,
each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law and regulations
(including the HSR Act) to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents or approvals of
third parties required in order to preserve material contractual
relationships of Parent and the Company and their respective subsidiaries and
to effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions. In
addition, subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and subject to
the fiduciary duties of the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and
Parent, none of the parties hereto shall knowingly take or cause to be taken
any action which would

     

   

## reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent consummation of the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company undertakes and agrees to file as soon
as practicable a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ ").

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
governmental authority in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with
the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
(x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar law becomes
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action
necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such law on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(c) Parent and the Company shall, from the date hereof until the Outside
Date, use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall have the sole and exclusive right to determine, at its option, whether
to contest through litigation on the merits, negotiation or other action any
position or claim, including any demands for sale, divestiture or disposition
of assets or business of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries, asserted by the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or other governmental authority in connection with
antitrust matters which would operate to hinder or delay the Effective Time.
Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct and control any such
litigation, negotiation or other action, with counsel of its own choosing,
and the Company agrees to reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11
shall require Parent or any of its subsidiaries to (i) propose, negotiate
for, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any material assets or
businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any assets or
businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries the sale, divestiture or
disposition of which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) otherwise take or commit to take
any actions that limit the freedom of action of Parent and its subsidiaries
with respect to, or their ability to retain, their material assets or one or
more of their businesses, or the material assets or businesses of the Company
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Surviving Corporation.

  

(d) The Company shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent to divest,
hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of
the businesses, services, or assets of the Company

     

   

or any of its subsidiaries, provided that any such action may be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(e) In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable law and the
limitations set forth in Section 5.03 and except as prohibited by any
applicable representative of any applicable governmental entity, (i) promptly
notify the other party of any written communication to that party from the
FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
governmental entity and permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any governmental
authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this
Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such governmental authority, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish
the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and written
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and its affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand,
and any government or regulatory authority or members or their respective
staffs on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

  

## SECTION 5.12   _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. (a) After the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior
to the Effective Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (collectively, " _Costs and Expenses_ "),
arising out of, relating to or in connection with (i) any action or omission
occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its affiliates) and (ii) this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising
out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the events and developments between Parent and the Company leading up to this
Agreement. In the event of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time) subject to this Section 5.12, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are
received and shall pay all other reasonable expenses in advance of the final
disposition of such action, (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such
matter, and (iii) to the extent any determination is required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the CGCL and Parents or the Surviving Corporations
respective certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, such
determination shall be made by independent legal counsel acceptable to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the

     

   

## Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and, provided, further, that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
advances or pays any amount to any person under this paragraph (b) and if it
shall thereafter be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that such person was not entitled to be indemnified hereunder for all or any
portion of such amount, to the extent required by law, such person shall
repay such amount or such portion thereof, as the case may be, to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be. The Indemnified Parties as a
group may not retain more than one law firm to represent them with respect to
each matter, except to the extent that under applicable standards
of professional conduct such counsel would have a conflict representing
such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties.

  

(b) In the event the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, set forth in this Section 5.12.

  

(c) For a period of six years commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies, including a tail
policy, of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties, and
which coverages and amounts shall be no less than the coverages and amounts
provided at that time for Parents directors and officers) with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that, if
the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed 200% of the
current aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as
shall then be available at an annual premium of not more than 200% of the
current aggregate annual premium.

  

(d) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.12.  The
