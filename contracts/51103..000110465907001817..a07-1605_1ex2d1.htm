being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<u>Exchange Fund</u>&#148;). The Disbursing

resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement.</h2>

disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of such balance

are not yet delinquent or are being disputed in good faith by appropriate

leased by the Company, the Company is entitled to and has exclusive possession
of such leased properties, and the leased properties are not subject to any
other legally binding lease, tenancy, license or easement of any kind that
materially interferes with the Company&#146;s use of the leased properties as
currently used.&#160; To the knowledge of the
Company, all leases under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries leases
any real or personal property are in good standing, valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there is not, under any of such leases, any existing default or event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default other than failures
to be in good standing, valid and effective and defaults under such leases
which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.</font></h2>
