 (g)   _Failure of Holder to Elect_. For the purpose hereof, a  holder of Shrewsbury Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election which  is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline (as hereinafter  defined) shall be deemed to have made a Non-Election. If Valley or the Exchange  Agent shall determine that any purported Cash Election or Stock Election was not  properly made, such purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall, unless  cured by the Election Deadline (as hereafter defined), be deemed to be of no  force and effect and the shareholder or Representative making such purported  Cash Election or Stock Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to have  made a Non-Election.

 2.3.   _Exchange of Shares_.

 (b)   Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange  Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the Record  Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange for such Certificates  the consideration as provided in _Section 2.1_ hereof and the Certificates  so surrendered shall be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to  deliver or cause to be delivered to any Record Holder the consideration to which  such Record Holder would otherwise be entitled until such Record Holder  surrenders the Certificates for exchange or, in default thereof, an appropriate  Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and/or a bond as may be reasonably  required in each case by Valley. Notwithstanding the time of surrender of the  Certificates, Record Holders shall be deemed shareholders of Valley for all  purposes from the Effective Time, except that Valley shall withhold the payment  of dividends from any Record Holder until such Record Holder effects the  exchange of Certificates for Valley Common Stock. (Such Record Holder shall  receive such withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share  exchange.) 

   

 (c)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer  books of Shrewsbury of the shares of Shrewsbury Common Stock which were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if any Certificates  representing such shares are presented for transfer, they shall be canceled and  exchanged for the consideration as provided in _Section 2.1_ hereof.

       2.4.   _No Dissenters  Rights_. Consistent with the provisions  of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, no shareholder of Shrewsbury shall  have appraisal rights with respect to the Merger. 

   

 2.5.   _Cancelled Shares_. Each DPC Share shall be canceled and  retired at the Effective Time. 

   

 2.6.   _Valley Shares_. The shares of Valley Common Stock  outstanding at the Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger, but along  with the additional shares of Valley Common Stock to be issued as provided in  _Section 2.1_ hereof, shall become the outstanding common stock of the  Surviving Corporation. 

   

 2.7.   _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (a)   Immediately following the receipt by the parties of regulatory approvals with  respect to the Merger, Valley shall have the opportunity to examine the books  and records of Shrewsbury and as soon as possible thereafter shall deliver to  Shrewsbury a written report setting forth the calculations of the  Shareholders Equity of Shrewsbury. " _Shareholders   Equity_" means the shareholders equity of Shrewsbury as  of the last day of the month immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in  accordance with GAAP (as such term is defined in Section 3.4) applied on a basis  consistent with the preparation of the Shrewsbury Financial Statements (as such  term is defined in Section 3.4). Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Shareholders Equity as of the Closing Date shall be determined after (i)  accruing through the Closing Date all of the expenses (including professional  fees and expenses) incurred by Shrewsbury in connection with the Merger whether  or not then due, (ii) disregarding any of the adjustments required by SFAS No.  115, and (iii) adding back any cash dividends declared or paid in accordance  with _Section 5.2(a)(ii)_. 

   

 (b)   If Shrewsbury objects to the calculation of Shareholders Equity,  Shrewsbury shall, within three days after receipt of the calculation of  Shareholders Equity, deliver a written notice (the _"Disputed  Items Notice_ ") to Valley specifying in detail the basis for  such objection and setting forth Shrewsburys computation of the items in  dispute (each, a " _Disputed Item_ "). Valley and  Shrewsbury shall promptly attempt to resolve the Disputed Items and agree upon  the Shareholders Equity. 

   

 (c)   If Valley shall not have received a Disputed Items Notice within three days  after receipt by Shrewsbury of the calculation of Shareholders Equity or  prior thereto, Shrewsbury shall be deemed to have accepted by written notice to  Valley the calculation of Shareholders Equity; such calculation shall be  conclusively presumed to be true and correct in all respects and shall be  binding upon the parties hereto and may not be disputed by any party in any  forum or by any means, and shall hereinafter be referred to as the  " _Final Calculation_." 

   

 (d)   To the extent that the Shareholders Equity agreed to (or deemed agreed to)  by the parties in the Final Calculation is less than $59,000,000, the  amount of such deficiency shall be defined as the  " _Deficit_." In the event there is a Deficit, the Per  Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Value used in calculating the  Exchange Ratio shall each be reduced by an amount equal to the Deficit divided  by the number of shares of Shrewsbury Common Stock issued and outstanding as of  the Closing Date.

Shrewsbury acknowledges that Valley may be involved in discussions concerning  potential acquisitions of banks and other entities and Valley shall not be  obligated to disclose such information to Shrewsbury except as such information  is publicly disclosed by Valley. 

   

28

       (b)   All information furnished by the parties hereto previously in connection with  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall be used  solely for the purpose of evaluating the Merger contemplated hereby and shall be  treated as the sole property of the party delivering the information until  consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby and, if such Merger shall not  occur, each party and each partys advisors shall return to the other party  all documents or other materials containing, reflecting or referring to such  information, will not retain any copies of such information, shall use its best  efforts to keep confidential all such information, and shall not directly or  indirectly use such information for any competitive or other commercial  purposes.

Such acquisition audit or due diligence shall not be limited or  restricted by virtue of any audit or due diligence performed before the date  hereof or for any other reason, but shall not unduly interfere with the business  of the other party.

Shrewsbury agrees to provide  Valley with any information, certificates, documents or other materials about  Shrewsbury as are reasonably necessary to be included in such other SEC reports  or registration statements, including registration statements which may be filed  by Valley prior to the Effective Time. Shrewsbury shall use its reasonable  efforts to cause its attorneys and accountants to provide Valley and any  underwriters for Valley with any consents, comfort letters, opinion letters,  reports or information which are necessary to complete the registration  statements and applications for any such acquisition or issuance of securities.

The directors of Shrewsbury in their capacity as shareholders agree to vote in favor of the Agreement. 

   

 5.8.   _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein  provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its best efforts to take, or  cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things  necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to satisfy  the conditions to Closing and to consummate and make effective the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, using reasonable  efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order  adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and using its best efforts to prevent the breach  of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party contained  or referred to in this Agreement and to promptly remedy the same. In case at any  time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to  carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of  each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. Nothing in  this section shall be construed to require any party to participate in any  threatened or actual legal, administrative or other proceedings (other than  proceedings, actions or investigations to which it is otherwise a party or  subject or threatened to be made a party or subject) in connection with  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such  party shall consent in advance and in writing to such participation and the  other party agrees to reimburse and indemnify such party for and against any and  all costs and damages related thereto. 

   

31

       5.9.   _Public Announcements_.

In the event that Valley or  Shrewsbury determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate  the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to  September 30, 2005 (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") and that  it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify the other party.  Except for any acquisition or merger discussions Valley may enter into with  other parties, Shrewsbury and Valley will promptly inform the other of any facts  applicable to Shrewsbury or Valley, respectively, or their respective directors  or officers, that would be likely to prevent or materially delay approval of the  Merger by any governmental authority or which would otherwise prevent or  materially delay completion of the Merger. 

   

 5.11.   _Disclosure Supplements_. From time to time prior to the Effective  Time, each party hereto will promptly supplement or amend (by written notice to  the other) its respective Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant hereto with  respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known  at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or  described in such Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in  such Schedules which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. If the  disclosure contained in any such supplement (i) relates to events occurring  before execution of this Agreement or (ii) alone or together with other  supplements or amendments materially adversely affects the representation to  which the amendment or supplement relates, the party receiving the amendment or  supplement may determine not to accept it as a modification of the relevant  representation. Notice of such determination, if made, shall be given by the  receiving party to the other party not later than 15 days after it received the  disclosure in question. If such notice is not timely given, or if the disclosure  in question did not contain any matter of the nature specified in clause (i) or  (ii) of the second preceding sentence, the relevant representation shall be  deemed modified by the disclosure in the amendment or supplement with the same  effect as though that disclosure had been included in the relevant Disclosure  Schedule as furnished prior to execution of this Agreement.

Shrewsbury shall accrue and/or pay all of such amounts as soon as possible. 

   

 (c)   Shrewsbury shall cause its professionals to render monthly invoices within 30  days after the end of each month. Shrewsbury shall notify Valley monthly of all  out-of-pocket expenses which Shrewsbury has incurred in connection with this  transaction.

 5.13.   _Closing_. The parties hereto shall cooperate and use reasonable  efforts to try to cause the Effective Time to occur on or before March 31, 2005. 

   

 5.14.   _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a)   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Valley shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior  to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or  officer of Shrewsbury (collectively, the " _Shrewsbury  Indemnitees_ ") against any and all claims, damages,  liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses (including, without limitation,  reasonable costs of investigation, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of  legal counsel and other advisers and experts as incurred), judgments, fines,  penalties and amounts paid in settlement, asserted against, incurred by or  imposed upon any Shrewsbury Indemnitee (" _Costs_ ")  by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of  Shrewsbury or acted as a director or officer of a third party at the request of  Shrewsbury, in connection with, arising out of or relating to any threatened,  pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative) (each a " _Claim_ "  and collectively, " _Claims_ "), including without  limitation any Claim which is based upon, arises out of or in any way relates to  the Merger, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, the Shrewsbury Indemnitees service as a member of the Board of  Directors of Shrewsbury or any committee thereof, the events leading up to the  execution of this Agreement, any statement, announcement, recommendation or  solicitation made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach of  any duty in connection with any of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest  extent which Shrewsbury would have been permitted under any applicable law and  its Governing Documents had the Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also  advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent so permitted). 

   

 (b)   From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any obligation  of Shrewsbury immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to the  indemnification of the Shrewsbury Indemnitees arising out of the Charter  Documents of Shrewsbury or arising out of any written indemnification agreements  between Shrewsbury and such persons disclosed in the __Shrewsbury Disclosure  Schedule__ __, as if such obligations were pursuant to a contract or  arrangement between Valley and such Shrewsbury Indemnitees.

   

 (c)   In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or  consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business combination  transaction with any other person or entity and is not the resulting, continuing  or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or transaction,  or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or transfers all or substantially all of its  properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case,  proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Valley  assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.14_. 

   

33

* * *

           

 (d)   Valley shall cause Shrewsburys officers and directors to be covered, for a  period of six years after the Effective Time, at Valleys option, under (i)  Valleys then current officers and directors liability  insurance policy (providing substantially similar coverage to Shrewsburys  officers and directors such officers and directors had under Shrewsburys  existing policy), or (ii) an extension of Shrewsburys existing  officers and directors liability insurance policy. However, Valley  shall only be required to insure such persons upon terms and for coverages  substantially similar to Shrewsburys existing officers and  directors liability insurance, and if such coverage over a six year period  would in the aggregate cost more than 200% of the annual premium currently paid  by Shrewsbury for such coverage, then Valley shall be required only to obtain  such coverage as may be obtained by an expenditure equal to 200% of the annual  premium currently paid by Shrewsbury for such coverage. 

   

 (e)   Any Shrewsbury Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this Section  5.14 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim, but the failure to  so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may have to such  Shrewsbury Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice Valley. In  the event of any Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) as  to which indemnification under this Section 5.14 is applicable, (x) Valley shall  have the right to assume the defense thereof and Valley shall not be liable to  such Shrewsbury Indemnitees for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other  expenses subsequently incurred by such Shrewsbury Indemnitee in connection with  the defense thereof, except that if Valley elects not to assume such defense, or  counsel for the Shrewsbury Indemnitees advises that there are issues which raise  conflicts of interest between Valley and the Shrewsbury Indemnitees, the  Shrewsbury Indemnitees may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Valley shall  pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Shrewsbury  Indemnitees as statements therefor are received; _provided, however_ , that  Valley shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.14(e) to pay for only one  firm of counsel for all Shrewsbury Indemnitees in any jurisdiction with respect  to a matter unless the use of one counsel for multiple Shrewsbury Indemnitees  would present such counsel with a conflict of interest that is not waivable by  the Shrewsbury Indemnitees, and (y) the Shrewsbury Indemnitees will cooperate in  the defense of any such matter. Valley shall not be liable for settlement of any  claim, action or proceeding hereunder unless such settlement is effected with  its prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14, Valley shall not  have any obligation hereunder to any Shrewsbury Indemnitee when and if a court  of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination  shall have become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such  Shrewsbury Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by  applicable law or public policy. 

   

 5.15.   _Employment and Director Matters_. 

   

 (a)   Following consummation of the Merger, Valley will honor the existing written  employment and severance contracts with officers and employees of Shrewsbury and  SSB that exist on the date hereof and are included in the __Shrewsbury  Disclosure Schedule__. 

   

34

* * *

           

 (b)   Valley intends, to the extent practical, to continue the employment of all  officers and employees of Shrewsbury and SSB, at or near the same location, with  the same or equivalent salary and benefits. Valley will allow each Shrewsbury  and SSB employee who becomes employed by Valley or VNB to participate in all the  benefits and opportunities available to all Valley employees generally. 

   

 (c)   Following the consummation of the Merger and for one year thereafter, VNB shall,  to the extent not duplicative of other severance benefits, pay severance to  Shrewsbury and SSB employees in accordance with Valleys written severance  policy and shall provide out placement assistance to each employee with a  position of Assistant Vice President or above at no cost to such employees,  provided, however, that Valley shall not be required to expend more than $5,000  per employee with regard to such out placement assistance. Shrewsbury and SSB  employees total years of employment, whether or not consecutive, will be  used to calculate benefits in accordance with Valleys written severance  policy. 

   

 (d)   Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide whether to  continue each of SSB and/or Shrewsburys pension and welfare plans for the  benefit of employees of SSB and Shrewsbury, or to have such employees become  covered under a Valley Pension and Welfare Plan. Subject to the foregoing,  following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall make available to all  employees and officers of Shrewsbury who become employed by VNB coverage under  the benefit plans generally available to VNBs employees and officers  (including pension and health and hospitalization) on the terms and conditions  available to VNBs employees and officers with no uninsured waiting periods  for enrollment in Valley or VNB medical and dental plans for Shrewsbury  employees and their dependents. No prior existing condition limitation not  currently imposed by Shrewsbury or SSB medical or dental plans shall be imposed  with respect to Valleys or VNBs medical and dental plans on  Shrewsbury or SSB employees. Shrewsbury and SSB employees shall receive  credit for any deductibles paid under Shrewsbury and SSB existing medical and  dental plans. Shrewsbury employees will be given credit under Valleys or  VNBs medical, life, vacation, sick leave, disability and other welfare  plans for total prior service with Shrewsbury, and Shrewsburys employees  will be granted credit for such prior service with Shrewsbury, solely for  purposes of eligibility and vesting under Valleys or VNBs 401(k)  plan. 

   

 (e)   The Shrewsbury and SSB employees listed on the __Shrewsbury Disclosure  Schedule__ shall receive Valley stock and incentive stock options  in accordance with the plan set forth on the __Shrewsbury Disclosure  Schedule__. 

   

 (f)   Each Shrewsbury director shall be offered the opportunity to participate in a  Valley regional advisory board which will be established in the Monmouth County,  New Jersey area. 

   

 (g)   Valley will honor the pension plan adopted by Shrewsbury for the benefit of its  Chairman to recognize his valuable contributions to Shrewsbury and SSB. 

   

 (h)   In order to secure the continuing interaction of two current directors of  Shrewsbury with the Shrewsbury and SSB customer base, Valley will offer each a  five year consulting agreement (collectively, the " _Consulting  Agreements_ __").

   

35

       Shrewsbury and SSB may award bonuses to its employees in accordance with past
practice up to an aggregate of $150,000, provided that  such bonuses shall be
accrued as of the Effective Time.   
---|--- 
   
         

 5.16.   _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. Neither Valley nor Shrewsbury  shall intentionally take, fail to take or cause to be taken or not taken, any  action within its control, which would disqualify the Merger as a  "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 5.17.   _Affiliates_. 

   

 (a)   Promptly, but in any event within 14 days, after the execution and delivery of  this Agreement, Shrewsbury shall deliver to Valley a letter identifying all  persons who, to Shrewsburys knowledge, may be deemed to be affiliates of  Shrewsbury under Rule 145 of the 1933 Act (" _Rule  145_ __"), including without limitation all directors and  executive officers of Shrewsbury.

   

 (b)   Shrewsbury shall cause each director of Shrewsbury to, and Shrewsbury shall use  its best efforts to cause each executive officer of Shrewsbury and each other  person who may be deemed an affiliate of Shrewsbury under Rule 145 to, execute  and deliver to Valley within 14 days after the execution and delivery of this  Agreement, a letter substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto  agreeing to be bound by the restrictions of Rule 145. 

   

 5.18.   _Bank Policies and Bank Mergers_. Notwithstanding that Shrewsbury  believes that it has established all reserves and taken all provisions for  possible loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and  regulations, Shrewsbury recognizes that Valley may have adopted different loan,  accrual and reserve policies (including loan classifications and levels of  reserves for possible loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement to  the Effective Time and in order to formulate the plan of integration for the  Bank Merger, Shrewsbury and Valley shall consult and cooperate with each other  with respect to (i) conforming to the extent appropriate, based upon such  consultation, Shrewsburys loan, accrual and reserve policies and  Shrewsburys other policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory  matters, including without limitation Federal Reserve, The Bank Secrecy Act and  FDIC matters, to those policies of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to  Shrewsbury from time to time, (ii) new extensions of credit by SSB where the  aggregate exposure exceeds $5,000,000, and (iii) conforming, based upon  such consultation, the composition of the investment portfolio and overall  asset/liability management position of Shrewsbury and SSB to the extent  appropriate; _provided_ that any required change in Shrewsburys  practices in connection with the matters described in clause (i) or (iii) above  need not be effected (A) more than five days prior to the Effective Time and (B)  unless and until all necessary regulatory, governmental and shareholder  approvals and consents have been received, all statutory waiting periods in  respect thereof have expired, Valley agrees in writing that all conditions  precedent to the Closing have occurred (other than the delivery of certificates,  opinions and other instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing),  and Valley has provided the Closing Notice. No accrual or reserve made by  Shrewsbury or any Shrewsbury Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any  litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve,  shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation,  warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or to  constitute a termination event within the meaning of _Section 7.1(d)_  or _Section 7.1(f)_ hereof. 

   

36

         5.19  _Compliance with the Industrial Site Recovery Act_. Shrewsbury, at its sole cost and expense, shall use its best efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each facility located in New Jersey owned or operated by Shrewsbury or any Shrewsbury Subsidiary (each, a " _Facility_ "), either: (a) a Letter of Non-Applicability (" _LNA_ ") from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (" _NJDEP_ ") stating that the Facility is not an "industrial establishment," as such term is defined under the Industrial Site Recovery Act ("ISRA"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the NJDEP informs Shrewsbury in writing that it will not issue an LNA by reason of the fact that the property and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement fall into a category that is "unmistakably exempt" from ISRA, Shrewsburys obligation under this clause shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon receipt of such letter from the NJDEP; (b) a Remediation Agreement issued by the NJDEP pursuant to ISRA authorizing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (c) a Negative Declaration approval, Remedial Action Workplan approval, de minimus quantity exemption, an approval pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:26B-5.1 through 5.8, a No Further Action letter or other document or documents issued by the NJDEP that satisfies the requirements of ISRA with respect to each Facility subject to ISRA. In the event Shrewsbury obtains a Remediation Agreement, Shrewsbury will post or have posted an appropriate Remediation Funding Source or will have obtained the NJDEPs approval to self-guaranty any Remediation Funding Source required under any such Remediation Agreement.

All necessary regulatory or governmental approvals  and consents (including without limitation any required approval of the OCC and  any approval or waiver required by the FRB) required to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained without any term or  condition which would materially impair the value of Shrewsbury and SSB, taken  as a whole, to Valley. All conditions required to be satisfied prior to the  Effective Time by the terms of such approvals and consents shall have been  satisfied; and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have  expired. Both VNB and SSB shall have taken all necessary action to consummate  the Bank Merger immediately after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c)   _Suits and Proceedings_. No order, judgment or decree shall be outstanding  against a party hereto or a third party that would have the effect of preventing  completion of the Merger; no suit, action or other proceeding shall be pending  or threatened by any governmental body in which it is sought to restrain or  prohibit the Merger or the Bank Merger; and no suit, action or other proceeding  shall be pending before any court or governmental agency in which it is sought  to restrain or prohibit the Merger or the Bank Merger or obtain other  substantial monetary or other relief against one or more parties hereto in  connection with this Agreement and which Valley or Shrewsbury determines in good  faith, based upon the advice of their respective counsel, makes it inadvisable  to proceed with the Merger because any such suit, action or proceeding has a  significant potential to be resolved in such a way as to deprive the party  electing not to proceed of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger or  the Bank Merger.

# ARTICLE VII

   

# TERMINATION

   

   7.1   _Permissive Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Shrewsbury: 

   

 (a)   by mutual consent of Shrewsbury and Valley; 

   

39

       (b)   by either Valley or Shrewsbury upon written notice to the other party (i) 60  days after the date on which any request or application for a required  regulatory approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or  recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such approval, unless  within the 60-day period following such denial or withdrawal a petition for  rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the applicable  Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall have the right to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ if such  denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure  of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the  covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii) if any  Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final  nonappealable order enjoining (other than on a temporary basis) or otherwise  prohibiting the Merger; 

   

 (c)   by either Valley or Shrewsbury, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on  or before the Cutoff Date unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such  date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this  Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set  forth herein; 

   

 (d)   by either Valley or Shrewsbury if the approval of the shareholders of Shrewsbury  required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by  reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such  shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; 

   

 (e)   by either Valley or Shrewsbury (provided that the terminating party is not then  in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement  contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the  representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the  other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following written  notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,  cannot be cured prior to the Closing, and which breach of a representation or  warranty, would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches, result in  a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the party committing such breach. 

   

 (f)   by either Valley or Shrewsbury (provided that the terminating party is not then  in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement  contained herein), if there shall have been a material breach of any of the  covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other  party hereto, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days  following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from  the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to  the Closing; 

   

 (g)   by Shrewsbury, if Shrewsburys Board of Directors shall have approved a  definitive agreement reflecting an Acquisition Transaction (the  " _Alternative Agreement_ "), but only if (1) at  least 48 hours prior to entering into the Alternative Agreement, Shrewsbury  provides a copy of the Alternative Agreement to Valley, (2) the Board of  Directors of Shrewsbury, after consultation with outside legal counsel and after  considering any response that Valley may have after reviewing the Alternative  Agreement, determines in good faith that approving the Alternative Agreement is  legally necessary for the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties under  applicable law, (3) the Board of Directors of Shrewsbury, after consultation  with its financial advisor and after considering any response that Valley may  have after reviewing the Alternative Agreement, determines in good faith that  the transactions contemplated by the Alternative Agreement are reasonably likely  to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory  aspects of the transaction and the party offering to enter into the Alternative  Agreement, and would, if consummated, be more favorable to the shareholders of  Shrewsbury than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and any  transaction then being proposed by Valley; and (4) prior to terminating  this Agreement, Shrewsbury (A) delivers to Valley a written acknowledgment, in  form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Valley, that upon consummation of  the first closing contemplated by the Alternative Agreement, Shrewsbury (and its  successors) shall be obligated to pay to Valley the Termination Fee (as  hereinafter defined) and the Termination Expenses (as hereinafter defined) and  (B) delivers to Valley a release signed by the parties to the Alternative  Agreement, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory  to Valley and shall irrevocably waive any right the releasing parties may have  to challenge the payment to Valley of the Termination Fee and the payment to  Valley of the Termination Expenses; 

   

40

       (h)   by Shrewsbury, if an event occurs which gives rise to the payment of a  Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.4_ , _provided_ , _however_ ,  that prior to terminating the Agreement under this _Section 7.1(h)_ Valley  shall have a period of 130 days to cure any such event or deficiency giving rise  to Shrewsburys right to termination under _Section 7.4_ ; 

   

 (i)   by Valley, if an event occurs which gives rise to the payment of a Termination  Fee pursuant to Section 7.3; 

    

 (j)   by Valley if the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ are  not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date; or 

   

 (k)   by Shrewsbury if the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_   are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date. 

   

 7.2.   _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this  Agreement by either Valley or Shrewsbury as provided in _Section 7.1_ , this  Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i)  _Sections 7.1_ , _7.3_ and _7.4_ shall survive any termination of  this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  this Agreement, in the event that either of the parties shall willfully default  in its obligations hereunder, the non-defaulting party may pursue any remedy  available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and shall be paid by the  willfully defaulting party for all damages, costs and expenses, including  without limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and printing expenses,  incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in connection herewith or in  the enforcement of its rights hereunder. 

   

 7.3.   _Termination Fee; Expenses_. In the event that at any time  after the date of this Agreement (A) the holders of Shrewsbury Common Stock  shall not have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby  at the meeting of such shareholders held for the purpose of voting on this  Agreement, (B) such meeting shall have been adjourned or canceled, (C) the Board  of Directors of Shrewsbury shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or  publicly announced its intent to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to  Valley, its recommendation, or shall have failed to reconfirm its  recommendation, that the shareholders of Shrewsbury approve the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, or (D) Shrewsbury shall have breached any  covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement and such breach would entitle  Valley to terminate this Agreement, in each case after (x) a bona fide  Acquisition Transaction shall have been communicated to Shrewsbury or (y) it  shall have been publicly announced that any person other than Valley or any  Subsidiary of Valley shall have made a bona fide proposal by public announcement  or written communication that becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage  in a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with, or a purchase or other  acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets or a majority of the  outstanding shares of Common Stock of, Shrewsbury, then, in any such case, if  this Agreement is terminated, Shrewsbury shall, concurrent with the consummation  of an Acquisition Event (as hereinafter defined) occurring within eighteen  months after such termination, pay to Valley (I) a fee of $4,125,000 (the  " _Termination Fee_ ") and (II) an amount equal to  the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Valley in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as itemized by Valley) (the  " _Termination Expenses_ "). For purposes of this  Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Event_ " shall  mean the first closing contemplated by an Acquisition Transaction. 

   

41

         7.4  _Termination Fee; Expenses_. In the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement, (a) any request or application for a required regulatory approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such approval for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (b) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining (other than on a temporary basis) or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and such denial, withdrawal or prohibition was based on alleged failure by Valley currently or previously to comply with any federal and/or state law, rule, regulation, regulatory agency order, or supervisory correspondence, then, if this Agreement is terminated by Shrewsbury pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ above (subject to the 130-day period specified in such _Section 7.1(h)_ ), Valley shall, within ten (10) days after such termination, pay to Shrewsbury an amount equal to (i) the fees and expenses of the Investment Banker for Shrewsbury (the " _Investment Banker Fees_ ") incurred through the date of termination, and (ii) the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Shrewsbury in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement arising after the date hereof (collectively, the " _Shrewsbury Termination Expenses_ "), provided, however, that if any Acquisition Event occurs within 18 months of the date of the payment of fees under this _Section 7.4_ , Shrewsbury shall refund the Investment Banker Fees to Valley in full, within ten (10) days of the date of the Acquisition Event.
