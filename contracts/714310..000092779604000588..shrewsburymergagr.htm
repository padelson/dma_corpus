          Stock as to which the election is being made (or properly completed, signed and

          so), notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the
          Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated
          by this <U>Section 2.2</U> and all such computations shall be conclusive and

          power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
          carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or
          qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
          business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
          assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
          except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a

          All of the Subsidiaries of Shrewsbury are listed in the <I><U>Shrewsbury
          Disclosure Schedule</U></I>. The term
          &#147;<B><I>Subsidiary</I></B>&#148;, when used in this Agreement with
          respect to Shrewsbury, means any corporation, joint venture, association,
          partnership, trust or other entity in which Shrewsbury has, directly or
          indirectly at least a 50% interest or acts as a general partner. Each Subsidiary
          of Shrewsbury is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
          laws of its state of incorporation. SSB is a commercial bank chartered under the
          laws of the State of New Jersey whose deposits are insured by the Bank Insurance
          Fund (the &#147;<B><I>BIF</I></B>&#148;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
          Corporation (the &#147;<B><I>FDIC</I></B>&#148;) to the fullest extent
          permitted by law. Each Subsidiary of Shrewsbury has the corporate power and
          authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
          business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do
          business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
          it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
          it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
          be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
          Shrewsbury. The <I><U>Shrewsbury Disclosure Schedule</U></I> sets forth
          true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, articles of
          association, bylaws or other comparable formation and governing documents
          (together the &#147;<B><I>Charter Documents</I></B>&#148;) of Shrewsbury
          and of each Shrewsbury Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof. Except as set
          forth in the <I><U>Shrewsbury Disclosure Schedule</U></I>, Shrewsbury
          does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any
          corporation, company, association, partnership, joint venture or other entity
          and owns no real estate, except (i) residential real estate acquired through
          foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in each individual instance with a
          fair market value less than $500,000 and (ii) real estate used for its banking
          premises. </FONT></P>

          The present value of all accrued benefits both vested and non-vested under each

          Valley&#146;s knowledge, adequate for such purposes. No deficiencies exist or
          have been asserted based upon the federal income tax returns of Valley and VNB. </FONT></P>

          Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide whether to
          continue each of SSB and/or Shrewsbury&#146;s pension and welfare plans for the
          benefit of employees of SSB and Shrewsbury, or to have such employees become
          covered under a Valley Pension and Welfare Plan. Subject to the foregoing,
          following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall make available to all
          employees and officers of Shrewsbury who become employed by VNB coverage under
          the benefit plans generally available to VNB&#146;s employees and officers
          (including pension and health and hospitalization) on the terms and conditions
          available to VNB&#146;s employees and officers with no uninsured waiting periods
          for enrollment in Valley or VNB medical and dental plans for Shrewsbury
          employees and their dependents. No prior existing condition limitation not
          currently imposed by Shrewsbury or SSB medical or dental plans shall be imposed
          with respect to Valley&#146;s or VNB&#146;s medical and dental plans on
          Shrewsbury or SSB employees.  Shrewsbury and SSB employees shall receive
          credit for any deductibles paid under Shrewsbury and SSB existing medical and
          dental plans. Shrewsbury employees will be given credit under Valley&#146;s or
          VNB&#146;s medical, life, vacation, sick leave, disability and other welfare
          plans for total prior service with Shrewsbury, and Shrewsbury&#146;s employees
          will be granted credit for such prior service with Shrewsbury, solely for
          purposes of eligibility and vesting under Valley&#146;s or VNB&#146;s 401(k)
          plan. </FONT></P>
