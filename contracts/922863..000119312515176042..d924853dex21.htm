continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the FBCA and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ ") and the separate corporate existence of the
Company under the laws of the State of Florida, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as otherwise set forth in this _Article I_. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the FBCA. 1.2 _Closing_. The closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New
York Plaza, New York, New York 10004 at 10:00 a.m. (New York local time) on
the later of (i) the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction
or waiver, if permitted by applicable Law, in accordance with this Agreement
of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of all conditions at the Closing) and
(ii) the first (1st) Business Day following the final day of the Go-Shop
Period (subject to the satisfaction or waiver, if permitted by applicable Law,
in accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ as of the date determined pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of all conditions at the Closing));
or at such other time and date or at such other place as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree upon in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Marketing Period has not ended prior to the date on which the Closing is
to occur pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, then the Closing
shall occur instead on the Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver,
if permitted by applicable Law, of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ that is the earlier to occur of (A) any Business Day before or
during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no fewer than two
(2) Business Days prior written notice to the Company, and (B) the
third Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period, or at
such other time and date or at such other place as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree upon in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs
is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

1.3 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall
prepare, and upon the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Parent shall cause
the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida as
provided in Section 607.1105 of the FBCA. The Merger shall become effective at
the time when the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Florida, or at such later time as may be agreed by
the parties in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger. The date and
time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Effective Time_."

of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly
amended and restated in accordance with its terms and as provided by
applicable Law (subject to _Section 6.11_).

 

2.2 _The Surviving Corporation Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, and without any
further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; CLOSING
PAYMENTS

4.1 _Merger Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities
of the Company or the sole shareholder of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (A) shares of
Company Common Stock owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (B) shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company
or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in each case of (A) and (B) other than shares of
Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds
and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties and (C) shares of Company Common Stock
that are Dissenting Shares (together with the shares of Company Common Stock
referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive $16.00 in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), payable to
the holder thereof, without interest, in the manner set forth in  _Section
4.2_. At the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock that
have been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate and uncertificated interest formerly
representing any shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, payable without
interest, in accordance with this _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_.

 



3 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the record holder of any
Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to _Section 4.2(g)_.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with
a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the record holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in immediately available
funds necessary and sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments
under  _Section 4.1(a)_ (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than as set forth in this _Article IV_. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent solely in (i) direct short-
term obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which
the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv) a combination of any of the foregoing.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts
payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ shall be returned to Parent in accordance
with  _Section 4.2(e)_. No such investment or losses thereon shall relieve
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article IV_ or affect the amount of Per Share Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock, and to the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under _Section 4.1(a)_, Parent
shall promptly provide additional cash to the Paying Agent to add to the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
under _Section 4.1(a)_. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Common
Stock for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of an

 



4  outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
which have converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 4.1_, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by any certificates held by such person shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a certificate representing shares of
Company Common Stock, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the Paying
Agent shall issue and deliver to the holder of such certificate, by check or
wire transfer (as specified in the letter of transmittal), a cash amount (less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.6_) equal to the
product of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such certificate and
such certificate (and the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby)
shall then be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated shares
of Company Common Stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and were represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
") a check or wire transfer for an amount of cash (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 4.6_) equal to the product of (i) the
Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of such Book-Entry Shares,
without such holder being required to deliver a certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock on the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such
certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 4.2(b)_,
each certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by
_Section 4.1_.

(c) _Depository Trust Company_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the
Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs
at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective
Time an amount of cash (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 4.6_) equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration
and (ii) the number of all Book-Entry Shares (such amount, the " _DTC
Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash
in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 



5 (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Common
Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any certificate representing shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance
with the procedures set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_, exchanged for the cash
amount to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.6_) to be paid
in the manner specified in the letter of transmittal to an account designated
by such holder.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time after the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) for payment of the amount to which such record holder is
entitled as a result of the Merger (upon due surrender of their shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof).

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver, in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, an amount in cash (less any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 4.6_) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate
and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by FBCA (but only to the extent required thereby),
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have not voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with, and who have complied with,
Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of FBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Sections 607.1301-607.1333 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect
or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under
FBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and Parent shall remain
liable for payment of the Per Share Merger

 



6  Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of FBCA and as provided in
the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (x) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals and any withdrawals of such
demands and (y) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer
to settle or compromise, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

4.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to by Parent
and the holder of any unexercised option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Option_ "), each Company Option issued by the Company
under the Stock Plan or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, and which is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be accelerated and cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than the payment date for the first full payroll cycle
following the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment.

 

(b) _Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise
agreed to by Parent and the holder of any restricted stock award, restricted
stock unit award or other similar equity award that is not a Company PSA (a "
_Company RSA_ "), each Company RSA issued by the Company under the Stock Plan
or otherwise, and which has not already vested and is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall vest in full, be canceled, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than
the payment date for the first full payroll cycle following the Effective
Time) for each such Company RSA an amount in cash, without interest,
determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company RSA, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

(c)  _Performance Share Awards_. At the Effective Time, except as otherwise
agreed to by Parent and the holder of any performance share award (a "
_Company PSA_ "), each Company PSA granted under the Stock Plan or otherwise,
and which is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
vest at (i) maximum level (as such term is used in the applicable performance
share award agreement) for Company PSAs granted in 2014, and (ii) target level
(as such term is used in the applicable performance share award agreement)
for Company PSAs granted in 2015 (subject to the proration of the number of
shares covered by each such Company PSA as set forth below), be canceled, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than the

Surviving Corporations or applicable Subsidiarys payroll, unless alternative
arrangements are specified by such holder, to the extent permitted thereby. In

the parties to this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
will be liable to any shareholders of the Company or other Person in respect
of any cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by shareholders of the Company as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or

as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated

 



8  thereunder or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law and

Paying Agent, as the case may be.

prospective equity and debt financing sources if such information was not
previously made available to Parent and (iii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations

with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
and (y) in each such case referred to in clause (ii) or (iii) above, the
Company Board, or any committee thereof, has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities
described in _Section 6.2(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party (for so long
as such party is an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended

with

 



39  Parent during such four (4) Business Day period to make such revisions to
the terms of this Agreement so that failure to effect such Change of

inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
(z) the Company Board, or such committee thereof, shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the
Parent Fee Commitment Letter offered in writing by Parent in a manner that

were to be given effect. Any material amendment to the terms of such Superior
Proposal, shall require a new notice from the Company pursuant to clause (x)
above, and the Company shall again be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the
Company Board, and such committee thereof, may also effect a Change of
Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal if an Intervening Event

the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (x) the Company
notifies Parent in writing, at least four (4) Business Days in advance, which
notice shall (1) state that an Intervening Event has occurred and that the
Company Board, or such committee thereof, has determined that in light of
such Intervening Event, the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
that the Company intends to take such action and (2) describe the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail; (y) after providing such notice and prior to
making such Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event,
if requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent

Recommendation would no longer be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and (z) the Company Board, or such committee
thereof, shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement,
the Financing Commitments and the Parent Fee Commitment Letter offered in
writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted
by the Company and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event would still be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board, or any
committee thereof, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under

including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d9 and Rule 14e2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making any
"stoplookandlisten" communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company);

issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement in accordance with the Exchange
Act, pending disclosure of its position or (y) an express rejection of an
Acquisition Proposal or an unqualified reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation shall be deemed to be an Change of Recommendation.

 

(h) _Notice_. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees
that (i) it will promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal is received by it indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if
applicable, copies of any written documentation constituting the Acquisition
Proposal, including proposed agreements) and (ii) in the event that any such
Person modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company
shall notify Parent within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such
modified Acquisition Proposal of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has
been modified and the terms of such modification (including, if applicable,
copies of any written documentation reflecting such modification); _provided_
, _however_ , that none of the requirements contemplated by the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply (x) during the Go-Shop Period or (y) to any
Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party or any modification
thereof (so long as submitted prior to a Fiduciary Termination). The Company
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits
the Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and
other information, and represents, as of the date hereof, that none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries is bound by a confidentiality agreement, which
prohibits the Company from providing such in connection with Parent.

6.3 _Proxy Statement; Information Supplied_. (a) The Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and
in any event use reasonable best efforts to file within twenty (20) Business
Days after the date hereof), a proxy statement in preliminary form relating
to the Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Buyer Parties shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to the Company any and all
information relating to the Buyer Parties required or reasonably requested by
the Company to be included in the Proxy Statement, including any information
required under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Company agrees that at the date of mailing to shareholders of
the Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, the Proxy Statement
will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such document or response and the Company shall give good faith
consideration to including any such reasonable comments in the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or response letter.

(b) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt
of any and all written comments and material oral comments from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for any material additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all written 

 



41  correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably promptly provide responses to
the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the
SEC. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared by the staff of the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not be required to call, give notice of or convene the Shareholders Meeting or
mail the Proxy Statement, in each case prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the record holders as of the record date established for the
Shareholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

6.4 _Shareholders Meeting_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following

staff of the SEC) confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, the Company, acting through the Company Board, or such committee
thereof, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation
and bylaws, shall (i) establish a record date for and give notice of, a
meeting of holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, (ii) cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the record holders as of the record date
established for the Shareholders Meeting and (ii) duly call, convene and hold
the Shareholders Meeting; _provided_ , that, the Company shall be permitted to
postpone the Shareholders Meeting, or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting beyond
the time that the Shareholders Meeting would otherwise be held, only (A) with
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (B) if there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) in order to
approve the Merger or to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Shareholders Meeting, (C) to allow additional solicitation of proxies
in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote or (D) as required by applicable
Law. In the event that the date of the Shareholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason adjourned, postponed or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such
adjournment, postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does
not establish a new record date for the Shareholders Meeting, as so adjourned,
postponed or delayed except for such new record date as required by applicable
Law. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to
the Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading. Subject to the Company Boards ability to make a
Change of Recommendation and _Section 6.2(f)_, the Company Board shall
include its recommendation that the shareholders of the Company approve and
adopt this Agreement in the Proxy Statement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such approval and adoption.

confidentiality concerns. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Company and Buyer Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(b) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Buyer Parties each shall keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notices or
other communications received by the Buyer Parties or the Company, as the
case may be, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor Buyer Parties shall, nor shall they permit any of their
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, participate in any meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby unless they consult with the
other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, give the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

persons designated by the general counsel, of the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall not be conducted
in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their
normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, such access or disclosure is
reasonably likely to (i) jeopardize any work product or attorney-client
privilege or contravene any Law or (ii) breach any Contract to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they are bound; _provided_
, that, with respect to the foregoing clause (ii), the Company shall use

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each individual who is an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each an " _Affected Employee_
") (other than any Affected Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining
Agreement), while employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries, with (i) a
base salary or regular hourly wage no less than the base salary or regular
hourly wage provided to such Affected Employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) incentive
compensation opportunities no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
incentive compensation opportunities (including equity and equity-based
compensation opportunities) provided to such Affected Employee by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to provide
incentives in the form of equity or equity-based compensation; (iii) employee
benefits (excluding equity and equity-based compensation and any benefits
offered under a Multiemployer Plan) that are no less favorable, in the

its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) severance
benefits in accordance with the Severance Guidelines (as set forth in _Section
6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) with respect to such Affected
Employee. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall be deemed to grant
any Affected Employee any right to continued employment after the Closing
Date.

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) in which the Affected
Employees are entitled to participate after the Closing Date to take into
account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit
accrual thereunder (but not for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension
plans), service by such employees as if such service were with Parent or its
Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was credited under an analogous
Benefit Plan (except to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service).

(c) Following the Closing Date, with respect to the Affected Employees and
their eligible dependents, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, to: (i) waive any pre-existing conditions to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, and actively at-work requirements and similar

forth on _Section 6.9(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) For the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) honor the terms of each of
the incentive plans set forth on _Section 6.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Company Incentive Plans_ "); provided, that, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not amend, alter or modify by

 



45  interpretation or otherwise the terms of the Company Incentive Plans
following the date hereof, (ii) honor, and not alter in any manner,
determinations made by the Company prior to the Effective Time in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice with respect to
calculating the achievement of the applicable performance metrics under the
Company Incentive Plans that are paid on a quarterly basis , (iii) act in
good faith, together with the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to
equitably adjust earnings per share performance metrics against which the
incentive targets are measured to reflect the capital structure of the
Surviving Corporation , (iv) apply adjustments to the performance metrics
under the Company Incentive Plans consistent with past practice and (v)
refrain from exercising discretion under Section 2.3(d) of the 2012 Equity
Incentive Plan to reduce the amounts payable under formulaic performance
metrics of the Company Incentive Plans.

(f) With respect to Affected Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under all Benefit Plans, employee severance and
retention plans in existence as of the date hereof or after the date hereof
in accordance with _Section 6.1_ and all employment, change in control or
severance agreements entered into prior to the date hereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, for purposes of any Benefit Plan or any agreement between an
Affected Employee and the Company or any Subsidiary containing a definition
of "change in control" or "change of control", the Closing shall be deemed to
constitute a "change in control" or "change of control."

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_, express or implied, (i) shall
prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates from amending or
terminating or ceasing participation in any Benefit Plan in accordance with
its terms and applicable Law, (ii) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any Benefit Plan or (iii) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including current or former Service Providers, or dependents or beneficiaries
of Service Providers) any rights as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

 

6.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the financing thereof shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense.

 

6.11 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer Parties, the Surviving
Corporation and its respective Subsidiaries shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted under the FBCA or other applicable Law, any individual who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or manager (or equivalent
position) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer
or manager (or equivalent position) of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is
or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, manager, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee (or
equivalent position) of another Person (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements), fines, liabilities, judgments, and amounts
that are paid in settlement in any threatened (in writing) or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal
or administrative, based in whole

 



46  or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i)
the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or manager (or
equivalent position) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or served at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
manager, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee of another Person, prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (iii) actions or omissions by an Indemnified Party taken at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each of (i), (ii), and
(iii), collectively " _Indemnity Proceedings_ "), in each case, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time. To the extent
permitted under the FBCA or other applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to promptly advance all out-of-pocket expenses of
each Indemnified Party in connection with any Indemnity Proceeding as such
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) are incurred upon
receipt from such Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by
invoices or other relevant documentation) upon receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified by applicable Law. In the event any Indemnity Proceeding is
brought against any Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto;
_provided_ , that none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in such Indemnity Proceeding with respect to any Indemnified
Party unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes a release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Indemnity Proceeding
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party as set forth in
_Section 6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (ii) any
indemnification provision, expense advancement provision and any exculpation
provision set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and equivalent organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries shall contain the provisions with respect
to indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from liability at
least as favorable as the indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation from liability provisions set forth in the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws and equivalent organizational documents of the
Companys relevant Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

(c) The Company (at Parents expense) shall cause the Indemnified Parties to
be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company
( _provided_ , that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and

 



47  conditions that are not less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof than
such policy and with carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys
current carrier) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time that were committed by such Indemnified Parties in their
applicable capacities as such ( _provided_ , that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premiums
currently paid by the Company on annualized basis); _provided_ , that in lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, at any time after the date hereof, the
Company may (at Parents expense), purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail
policy" that provides coverage no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than the coverage described above.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its respective successors and assigns, (iii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract,
any Benefit Plan, the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries), or
otherwise and (iv) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all
the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6.11_.

6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors
shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably
necessary under such Takeover Statute so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
Takeover Statute on such transactions.

6.13 _Financing; Financing Cooperation; Credit Agreement; Company Notes._  

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitments and shall not permit, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under the Debt Financing
Commitment if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required to consummate the
transactions 

 



48  contemplated by this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) unless there is a
corresponding increase in the Equity Financing Commitment, (y) impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (I) materially delay (taking into account the Marketing Period)
or prevent the Closing Date or (II) adversely impact in any material respect
the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on
the terms hereof or under the Debt Financing Commitment. Parent may replace
or amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof to the extent that the
commitments in the aggregate of the lenders to provide the Debt Financing are
not reduced as a result of any such replacement or amendment. Parent shall
reasonably promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of any Debt Financing Commitment or of
any fee or other letter or agreement relating thereto that would affect the
Debt Financing in the manner contemplated by foregoing clauses (x) and (y) of
this clause (a). For purposes of this  _Section 6.13_ and _Section 9.5_,
references to Financing shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section
6.13(a)_ and references to Financing Commitments or Debt Financing Commitment
shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified by this
_Section 6.13(a)_. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Buyer Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to, to the extent within its control (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated except to the extent additional
or alternative financing would then be available to consummate the
transactions on the Closing Date, (ii) satisfy all conditions and covenants
within the control of the Buyer Parties in the Debt Financing Commitment at or
prior to Closing to the extent necessary to consummate the Debt
Financing, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or on such
terms acceptable to Parent and the providers of the Debt Financing, and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing on the terms set forth in
the applicable Financing Commitment. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Buyer Parties shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material breach or default) by any party to any Financing
Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of which the Buyer
Parties become aware to the extent it would impair or delay the Closing or
result in insufficient financing to consummate this Agreement; (B) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment or any definitive
document related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing
Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing; and (C) if
for any reason the Buyer Parties believe in good faith that they will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the
definitive documents related to the Financing unless alternative financing
would then be available; _provided_ , that in no event will any of the Buyer
Parties be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client privilege if the Buyer Parties shall have used
their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would
not waive such privilege. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions

 



49  contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, at its sole expense, alternative financing
from alternative sources on terms and conditions that are no less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Parent than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment together with the Equity Financing Commitment, in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event
later than the date on which the Closing is scheduled to occur pursuant to
_Section 1.2._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 6.13(a)_ will require, and in
no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require, Parent to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other
than the counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by,
the Equity Financing Commitment or (ii) pay any fees in connection with the
alternative financing that are materially (as a percentage of the total amount
of Debt Financing) in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment or Debt Financing fee letters (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise), as determined by Parent in its
reasonable judgment.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first (1st) period of eighteen (18)
consecutive Business Days after the date of this Agreement throughout which
(A) Parent shall have the Essential Marketing Information; _provided_ , that
such Business Day period shall not be required to be consecutive to the extent
it would include July 3, 2015 (which such date shall be excluded for purposes
of, but shall not reset, the eighteen (18) consecutive Business Day period);
provided, further that if such Business Day period has not ended on or prior
to August 19, 2015, then it will not commence until September 8, 2015;
_provided_ , _further_ that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably
believe that the Company has provided the Essential Marketing Information in
connection with the commencement of the Marketing Period, it may deliver to
Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed
such delivery), in which case the Company shall be deemed to have complied
with the foregoing requirements unless Parent in good faith
reasonably believes the Company has not completed the delivery of the
Essential Marketing Information and, within four (4) Business Days after the
delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the
Company to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity which Essential
Marketing Information the Company has not delivered) and (B) the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ (other than the conditions contemplated by
_Section 7.1(a)_ and  _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_) shall have been satisfied or
waived (and remain satisfied or waived) and nothing has occurred and no
condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2_ to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for
any time during such eighteen (18) consecutive Business Day period; _provided_
, _further_ , that the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have not commenced
if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, (A)
PricewaterhouseCooper LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion contained in
the Essential Marketing Information or (B) the Company or its auditors have
determined to undertake a restatement of any financial statements included in
the Essential Marketing Information; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the eighteen (18) consecutive Business Day period be restarted or cease
to continue if financial information required pursuant to Section (i) of the
definition of "Essential _Marketing Information" is delivered after such_
eighteen (18) consecutive Business Day period has commenced; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is
the date on which the Debt

 



50  Financing otherwise is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any
time Parent does not have the Essential Marketing Information or the Essential
Marketing Information is not compliant with the requirements set forth in the
definition thereof throughout and on the last day of such period, then a new
eighteen (18) consecutive Business Day period shall commence upon Parent
receiving updated Essential Marketing Information that is so compliant.

(ii) " _Essential Marketing Information_ " shall mean, as of any date, (i) (A)
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and related statements of
operations and changes in cash flows of the Company for the three most
recently completed fiscal years of the Company ended at least 90 days before
the Closing Date and (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related
statements of operations and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent
fiscal quarter (or year-to-date period) after the most recent fiscal year in
respect of which financial statements described in clause (A) above have been
delivered and ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date (other than any
fourth fiscal quarter), _provided_ , that the filing of the required financial
statements on form 10-K and form 10-Q within such time periods by the Company
shall satisfy the requirements of this clause (i), (ii) all financial and
related information reasonably requested in writing by Parent or Merger Sub
and necessary to permit Parent and Merger Sub to prepare a pro forma
consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma statement of operations of
the Company as of and for the twelve-month period ending on the last day of
the most recently completed four-quarter period and ended at least 45 days
prior to the Closing Date (or, if the most recently completed fiscal period
is the end of a fiscal year, ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date),
prepared after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Financing) as if such transactions had occurred as of such
date (in the case of the balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in
the case of the statement of operations) and (iii) to the extent requested in
writing by Parent or Merger Sub, all information reasonably and customarily
required for the preparation of, a confidential information memorandum to
syndicate the loans included in the Debt Financing. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Each Buyer Party
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to their respective obligations to
effect the Merger.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the officers,
employees, advisors and other Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide to the Buyer Parties,
at Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by the Buyer
Parties that is necessary and customary in connection with Parents efforts
to obtain the Debt Financing, including (i) to the extent reasonably available
to the Company, furnishing the Buyer Parties and the providers of Debt
Financing the Essential Marketing Information and such other financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties, (ii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings (including a customary lender meeting with the
parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and material prospective
lenders for Debt Financing and the senior management of the Company), due
diligence sessions and drafting sessions in connection with the Debt
Financing at times and in locations reasonably acceptable to the Company and
to the extent customary and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Company, (iii) reviewing, as reasonably requested
by Parent, rating agency presentations and lender

 



51  information memoranda relating to the Debt Financing, prepared by Parent and
Merger Sub and reasonably required in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that any rating agency presentations, lender information
memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing shall contain disclosure reflecting the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries as the obligor, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of the Buyer Parties and the providers of Debt Financing for all or
any portion of the Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including, (A) customary authorization
letters and confirmations in connection with the Essential Marketing
Information, (B) to the extent available, documents relating to the repayment
of the existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
release of related liens, including customary payoff letters and (C)
agreements, documents or certificates (including insurance) that facilitate
the creation, perfection or enforcement of liens securing the Debt Financing
as requested by the Buyer Parties or the providers of Financing and that are
required to be obtained under the Debt Financing Commitment at Closing, in
each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent;
_provided_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such agreements or documents shall be effective until the Effective
Time, (vi) subject to customary confidentiality agreements, using reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with the due diligence investigation of
the providers of Debt Financing, to the extent customary and reasonable and
not unreasonably interfering with the business of the Company, including
providing reasonable access as necessary for completion of an initial field
exam and audit in connection with the borrowing base for the asset-based loan
component of the Debt Financing, (vii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and its Affiliates with
respect to that Debt Financing Commitment, (viii) if reasonably requested in
writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, providing at least
three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, and as reasonably requested by the
Buyer Parties, all documentation and other information with respect to the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates that any
lender has determined is required by regulatory authorities in connection with
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56
(signed into law October 26, 2001), (ix) cooperating in the prepayment and
termination of any existing indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
the termination of all guaranties and security interests in connection
therewith and the delivery of customary payoff letters, lien releases and
termination documentation with respect to the foregoing, in each case
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, (x) providing a certificate of the
chief financial officer or other senior financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters as of the Closing on a pro forma basis in the form
provided in connection with the Debt Financing, and (xi) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions
reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties or the providers of Debt Financing
and customary for financings similar to the Financing; _provided_ , _however_
, that, (a) irrespective of the above, no obligation of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document or instrument (other
than the authorization and representation letters referred to above) shall be
effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any such certificate,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the
entry into any agreement that is effective before the Effective Time) or that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (b) nothing herein shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (c)
neither the Company nor

 



52  any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or
information document. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment in connection with the Financing prior
to the Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing;  _provided_ , that
such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) From the date hereof, if Parent requests in writing at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such notice,
to (i) commence an offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Company Notes in cash using funds provided by Parent
at the Closing pursuant to _Section 4.7_ and/or (ii) commence a related
consent solicitation to amend or remove any provisions in the Indenture that
may be amended or removed with the consent of the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Company Notes, (the actions described in
the foregoing clause (ii), the " _Indenture Amendments_ " and both actions
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), together with any
changes, amendments, extensions or modification proposed by the Company and
reasonably agreed to by Parent, are referred to collectively as the " _Company
Notes Tender Offer_ "); _provided_ that the Companys counsel shall provide
such legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by the dealer-manager
engaged by Parent that are customary and necessary in connection with the
Company Notes Tender Offer and that are consistent with such counsels
internal opinion policies and subject to receipt of all requisite
certificates. The Company Notes Tender Offer shall be made on such terms and
conditions (including any changes, amendments, extensions or modification of
such terms and conditions) as determined and requested by Parent, and all
Company Notes Tender Offer documents shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms and conditions
of the Company Notes Tender Offer shall provide that such offer shall be
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, and the
parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Notes Tender Offer to close concurrently with the Closing. The Company
shall coordinate the Company Notes Tender Offer process with Parent and keep
Parent promptly and reasonably informed of all material information regarding
status, results and timing of the Company Notes Tender Offer. The Company
shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Company
Notes Tender Offer, including using reasonable best efforts in assisting with
the preparation of the Company Notes Tender Offer documents. The Company (i)
shall waive any of the conditions to the Company Notes Tender Offer (other
than the occurrence of the Closing) and make any change to the Company Notes
Tender Offer, in each case, as may be reasonably requested by Parent and (ii)
shall not, without the written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, waive any condition to the Company Notes Tender Offer or make
any changes to the Company Notes Tender Offer.

(e) Notwithstanding _Sections 6.13(c)_ and _6.13(d)_ or any other sections in
this Agreement to the contrary, the actions contemplated in this _Section
6.13_ or under any other provision of this Agreement do not and shall not (i)
require such cooperation to the extent it would require the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective

 



53  Representatives to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, incur any
actual or potential liabilities (of any kind), pay any fees, reimburse any
expenses, or provide any indemnity, or enter into any definitive agreement,
in each case, with respect to any Financing, any actions with respect to the
Company Notes or Credit Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.13_, in each case prior to the Closing for which it has not
received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Parent, or take any actions
that would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to breach this
Agreement or become unable to satisfy a condition to the Closing, (ii)
require such cooperation from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
its or their respective Representatives to the extent it would reasonably be
expected to interfere in any material respect with the ongoing operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) cause the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives to incur any
actual or potential liability under any certificate, agreement, arrangement,
document or instrument relating to the Financing, the Company Notes or the
Credit Agreement, (iv) involve any binding commitment by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives which
commitment is not conditioned on the Closing and does not terminate without
liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their
respective Representatives upon the termination of this Agreement, (v) require
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives to be the issuer of any securities or issue any offering
document prior to Closing or require the Company, any of its affiliates, or
any of its or their respective Representatives to enter into or approve any
Financing or purchase agreement for any Financing prior to the Closing, (vi)
require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their
respective Representatives to provide any information the disclosure of which
is prohibited or restricted by applicable Law or legal proceeding or that is
legally privileged, (vii) require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
of its or their respective Representatives to take any action that will
conflict with or violate the organizational documents of such person or any
applicable Law or legal proceeding, (viii) require any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver or be required to deliver any
certificate or take any other action pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ to the
extent any such action would reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability of any kind to such Representative, or (ix) require the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives prior
to Closing to make any representation to Parent, any of its affiliates, any
lender, agent or lead arranger to any Financing, or any other person with
respect to any actions under this _Section 6.13_, as to the solvency of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, or to deliver or require to be delivered any solvency or
similar certificate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
_Section 6.13_, the parties agree that any action taken or not taken with
respect to the matters contemplated by this _Section 6.13_ will not be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether any condition in
_Article VII_ is satisfied or whether any right of termination arises under
_Article VIII_ , and will not in any event give rise to liabilities or
obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries,
and their respective Representatives from, against and in respect of any
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties, of any kind (" _Losses_ "), imposed on, sustained,
incurred or suffered by, or asserted against, any of them, directly or
indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from the arrangement of
the Financing, any other cooperation pursuant to this _Section 6.13_, and/or
the provision of information utilized in connection therewith to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law,

 



54  except to the extent such Losses arise out of the willful misconduct or
intentional fraud of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall from
time to time (and upon request by the Company) promptly reimburse the Company
for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable out-
of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
Companys or its Subsidiaries or Representatives obligations under _Section
6.13_. This _Section 6.13(f)_ shall survive the Effective Time or earlier
termination of this Agreement.

 

6.14 _Shareholder Litigation_. In the event that any shareholder or derivative
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing, prior to the Effective Time against the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the members of the Company Board, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any such shareholder litigation and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to the defense or
settlement of such litigation and no settlement thereof shall be agreed upon
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

6.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual

contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in

obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and any monetary
damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Fee.

damages of the Buyer Parties arising out of or related to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the
Company that is not a willful and material breach), the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure against the Company Obligors and (B) after
being paid such amounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (x)

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

as a third party beneficiary under the Parent Fee Commitment Letter, subject
to the terms thereof, and to specific performance of the Buyer Parties
obligation hereunder to cause the Termination Obligations to be funded to
fund the payment of the Parent Fee, the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations of Parent under _Section 6.13(f)_ hereof and any monetary
obligations of Parent under clause (ii) of _Section 8.5(a)_ hereof, when and
if due and payable.

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 9.5(c)(i)_, it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance as a third party
beneficiary under the Equity Financing Commitments, subject to the terms
thereof, and to seek specific performance of the Buyer Parties obligation
hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger and
to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_, on
the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if and only if (A)
all conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)), (B) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (C) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing pursuant to _Article II_ will
occur; provided, that while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section 9.5(c)_ and the payment of Parent
Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (1) a grant of specific performance of the Equity Financing to be
funded and/or the consummation of the Merger (which specific performance grant
is satisfied) and (2) the payment of Parent Fee; provided, further, that, in
no event shall the Company or any Affiliate of the Company seek to recover any
money damages in excess of the Parent Fee and the indemnification and
reimbursement provisions of  _Section 6.13(f)_.

 



65 (iii) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross- claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the parties providing the Debt Financing, together with
their respective Affiliates, and their and their respective Affiliates
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Debt Finance Parties_
"), in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and (ii) that
any such action or claim shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of
law rules of such State that would result in the application of the laws of
any other state and (iii) it will waive and hereby waive any right to trial
by jury in respect of any such action. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
the Debt Finance Parties.
