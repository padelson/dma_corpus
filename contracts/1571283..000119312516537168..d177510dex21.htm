16  Seller will deliver the Estimated Closing Statement no later than 12:00 p.m.
(Pacific Time) on April 27, 2016 that assumes a Closing date of April 29,

The Estimated Closing Statement shall be in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_. The Buyer hereby acknowledges receipt of such schedules and data
with respect to the Estimated Closing Statement and the Sellers
determination of the Estimated Purchase Price set forth therein and each
component thereof as the Buyer has deemed reasonably necessary to support such
amounts.

 

(b) The Buyer will deliver to the Seller, by no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, a closing statement setting forth the Buyers good
faith calculations of the actual amounts of Closing Cash, Reserves, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Adjustment Amount and the adjusted Purchase Price

to the determination of each of the foregoing amounts as are reasonably
necessary to support such amounts (the " _Closing Statement_ "). If the Buyer
fails to deliver the Closing Statement by the deadline set forth in the

Buyer a Closing Statement. If the Seller does not deliver a Closing Statement
to the Buyer within thirty (30) days after the deadline set forth in the first
sentence of this  _Section 2.4(b)_ ( _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ), then the
Buyer and the Seller will be deemed to have accepted the Estimated Closing
Statement in full and the Estimated Closing Statement will become final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes under this Agreement.

(c) If either the Buyer or the Seller disagrees in whole or in part with the
Closing Statement, then the disagreeing Party will deliver to the receiving
Party, by no later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the receiving
Party receives the Closing Statement, a written notice of disagreement setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement (a " _Notice
of Disagreement_ "). If either the Buyer or the Seller fails to deliver a
Notice of Disagreement by the deadline set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Parties will be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement
in full and the Closing Statement will become final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes under this Agreement.

 

(d) If either the Buyer or the Seller timely delivers a Notice of
Disagreement, the Buyer and the Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days, or such longer period as
they may mutually agree, to resolve any disputed items. All disputed items
agreed to during the foregoing period will become final, conclusive and
binding on the Buyer, the Seller and the Company and will not be subject to
further appeal. If, at the end of the foregoing period, there remain any
unresolved disputed items, those unresolved disputed items will be referred to
a nationally-recognized, U.S.-based accounting firm to be mutually agreed by
the Buyer and the Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Buyer and the Seller
will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the services to be
rendered by the Accounting Firm under this paragraph, such services to be
provided in the Accounting Firms capacity as an accounting expert and not an
arbitrator. The Accounting Firm will be directed to determine as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within thirty (30) days from the date on which
the dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm), whether any of the Closing
Cash, Closing Reserves, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Adjustment Amount or
Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment. The
Accounting Firm will be instructed that, in making such determination, it may
only consider matters still in dispute between the Buyer and the Seller and
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item 

 



17  claimed by the Buyer or the Seller or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by the Buyer or the Seller. The Buyer and the Seller each will
furnish to the Accounting Firm any work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed items and will provide any interviews and
answer any questions that the Accounting Firm may reasonably request. The
determination of the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on
the Buyer, the Seller and the Company. The fees and expenses for the services
of the Accounting Firm will be borne pro rata between the Buyer and the Seller
in proportion to the final allocation made by the Accounting Firm of
the disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by the Buyer and
the Seller, such that the prevailing Party pays the lesser proportion of such
fees and expenses. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, each of the
Buyer and the Seller will be responsible for its own fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this paragraph.

__(e) Following the agreement or determination of the Purchase Price in
accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_, _Section 2.4(c)_ or _Section 2.4(d)_ (

(a) The Seller will cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to prepare
and timely file all Returns and amendments thereto required to be filed by
the Company and each Company Subsidiary for all Tax periods ending on or prior
to the date of the Closing which must be filed after the date of the Closing
consistent with past practices. The Seller will provide, and the Buyer will
have reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, prior to filing, all
such Returns. The Seller will act reasonably in deciding whether to accept or
reject such comments; _provided_ , that in the event the Buyer believes that
the Seller is not acting reasonably, disputed items on the applicable Return
will be referred to an Accounting Firm, and the determination of the
Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Buyer, the Seller
and the Company.

 

(b) The Buyer will cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to prepare
and timely file all Returns required to be filed by the Company and each
Company Subsidiary after the date of the Closing with respect to the taxable
year that includes but does not end on the date of the Closing (" _Straddle
Period Returns_ ") consistent with past practices to extent permitted
by applicable Law. The Buyer will provide, and the Seller will have
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, prior to filing, all such
Straddle Period Returns and amendments thereto. The Buyer will act reasonably
in deciding whether to accept or reject such comments; _provided_ , that in
the event the Seller believes that the Buyer is not acting reasonably,
disputed items on the Straddle Period Return will be referred to an Accounting
Firm, and the determination of the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive
and binding on the Buyer, the Seller and the Company.

 



40 (c) The Buyer and the Seller will notify one another in writing within 10 days
of receipt of any notice of any audit, assessment, proposed adjustment,
notice of deficiency, litigation, dispute or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, could be grounds for
indemnification under this Agreement by the other party (each, a " _Tax
Contest_ "); _provided_ , that a failure to give such notification will not
affect indemnification provided hereunder, except and only to the extent that
the Indemnitee actually and materially was prejudiced by such delay. The
Buyer will have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest;
_provided_ , that the Buyer will (i) keep the Seller reasonably informed of
the progress of any Tax Contest, (ii) provide the Seller with copies of any
pleadings, correspondence, and other documents received from the relevant tax
authority, and all written materials submitted to such taxing authority by the
Buyer with respect to any Tax Contest, (iii) permit the Seller to participate
(but not control) at its own expense in any Tax Contest relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period and (iv) provide the Seller an opportunity to comment in
connection with any Tax Contest and act reasonably in deciding whether to
accept or reject such comments; _provided further_ , that, in addition to and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Buyer will not settle or compromise
any Tax Contest without the Sellers prior written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) The Seller and the Buyer will (i) reasonably assist one another in
preparing and filing any Returns that the Buyer or the Seller is responsible
for preparing and filing with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for the Straddle Period and reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits
by, or disputes or other proceedings with, any Governmental Authority or with
respect to any matters relating to Taxes for the Straddle Period and any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, (ii) make available to one
another and to any Governmental Authority as reasonably requested by any such
party all information, records and documents relating to Tax matters
(including Returns) of or relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
relating to the Straddle Period or any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date, and (iii) reasonably assist one another to facilitate the demand
for written statements from shareholders of record disclosing such ownership
as required pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.857-8. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.8(d)_
will obligate the Seller or its Representatives (x) to prepare or create any
financial or other data or information outside the ordinary course of
business or (y) to disclose to the Buyer or its Representatives any
information if doing so would violate any contract or applicable Law to which
the Seller is subject.

 

 __(e) For any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured
by income, receipts, transfers, transactions or payroll of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for the Pre- Closing Tax Period will be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the day before
the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes (other than such
Taxes prorated under _Section 1.1_ _(Certain Defined Terms)_ of this
Agreement) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the day before the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. __

 



41 __(f) The Seller will be entitled to the amount of any refund of Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(to the extent such Taxes were paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing, or by the Seller after the Closing) which refund is actually
received by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Closing, net of any cost
to the Buyer and its Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt of
such refund unless such refunds were taken into account under _Section 2.4_
_(Purchase Price Adjustment)_. The Buyer will pay such amount to the Seller
within 10 days of the receipt of the refund by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. The Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will cooperate
with the Seller in filing any reasonable claims for such tax refunds to which
the Seller is entitled to with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. __

(g) The Seller, the Buyer and the Company will treat the sale of the Shares
as a sale of equity interests in the Company for all tax purposes, and will
report the sale of Shares consistently with the foregoing for all tax
purposes. The Buyer will not make or cause to be made an election under
Section 338 of the Code (or similar provision under state or local law) with
respect to the purchase of the Shares.

 

(h) From and after the Closing, the Buyer, the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries will not amend Returns in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period in a manner that would give rise to a Tax liability of the
Seller or an indemnification obligation of the Seller under _Section 8.2(a)_,
unless required by any applicable Law, without obtaining the written
consent of the Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Seller if an
amendment of a Return discussed in this _Section 6.8(h)_ is required by
applicable Law.

 

Section 6.9. _Disclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Disclosure
Schedules are inserted for convenience of reference only, and will not be
deemed to constitute a part thereof or of this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this
Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section
of the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to any particular representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement will be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements is reasonably apparent
on its face (notwithstanding the presence or absence of a section number of
the Disclosure Schedules that corresponds to the section number of such other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or a cross-reference
thereto). The mere inclusion of an item on the Disclosure Schedules will not
be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, and exclusively
by virtue of the inclusion of such item on the Disclosure Schedules, that (i)
such item is required to be listed on the Disclosure Schedules, (ii) such
item, or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance, represents a material exception or fact, event, or
circumstance, (iii) such item has had, or is expected to result in, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Seller Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) such item
actually constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any applicable
Law, Permit or Material Contract, or other topic to which such disclosure is
applicable.

 



42 __(b) From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_ (
_Termination_ ), the Seller will be entitled to disclose to the Buyer in
writing, in good faith and in reasonable detail based on the facts known at
the time and specifically identified as for the purpose of updating the
Disclosure Schedules, any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and
warranties contained in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV hereof to the extent (a)
arising out of facts or circumstances occurring after the date hereof (but
not to the extent arising out of facts and circumstances occurring on or prior
to the date hereof, even if the Seller first obtains knowledge of such events
after the date hereof) and (b) not resulting from a breach of any of the
Companys obligations set forth in _Section 6.1_ _(Conduct of Business Prior
to Closing)_ hereof; and, for all purposes of this Agreement, such disclosures
will amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedules delivered to the Buyer on
the date hereof (the " _Updated Schedules_ "); provided, that upon delivery of
any such Updated Schedule to the Buyer, and solely to the extent the matters
disclosed in such Updated Schedule have a material and non-beneficial impact
on the Company or the Company Properties as a whole, the Buyer may deliver
written notice (the " _Update Termination Notice_ ") to the Seller within
three (3) Business Days of receipt of such Updated Schedule of its
election to terminate this Agreement (an " _Update Termination Event_ "). If
the Buyer fails to deliver to the Seller an Update Termination Notice within
the three (3) Business Day period following receipt of any Updated Schedules,
the Buyer will be deemed (i) to have waived its right to deliver an Update
Termination Notice with respect to the disclosure set forth on the Updated
Schedule (and only with respect to such disclosure), which disclosure and
Updated Schedule, accordingly, will not constitute an Update Termination
Event, and (ii) to have accepted such Updated Schedule and to have waived any
indemnification rights with respect to the contents of such Updated Schedule
under this Agreement. __

 

Section 6.10. _Audit Cooperation_. For a period of one (1) year after the
Closing Date, the Seller will, from time to time, upon reasonable advance
notice from the Buyer, provide (a) the Buyer and its Representatives access to
all financial and other information pertaining to the period of the Companys
and each applicable Company Subsidiarys ownership and operation of any
Company Property (other than such matters that relate to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or to transactions potentially competing with or
alternative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), which
may include any such information and/or documents more particularly described
on _Schedule 6.10_ attached hereto, which information is relevant and
reasonably necessary, in the opinion of the Buyers outside, third party
accountants (the " _Accountants_ "), to enable the Buyer and its Accountants
to prepare financial statements in compliance with any or all of (i) Rule 3-14
of Regulation S-X of the SEC, (ii) any other rule issued by the SEC
and applicable to the Buyer or its Affiliates, and (iii) any registration
statement, report or disclosure statement filed with the SEC by, or on behalf
of the Buyer or its Affiliates and (b) reasonable assistance to the Buyer and
the Accountants in completing an audit of such financial statements. The
Seller will provide or cause to be provided such information and documentation
on a per-Company Property basis, if available; _provided_ that any access or
furnishing of information must be conducted at the Buyers expense during
normal business

 



43  hours, under the supervision of the Sellers personnel, and in such a manner
as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Seller.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 6.10_ will obligate the Seller or its Representatives (x) to prepare
or create any financial or other data or other information, summaries or
materials of any kind or nature outside the ordinary course of business of
the Seller and the Company as of the Closing, (y) to incur any out of pocket
expenses in connection with such cooperation unless reimbursed promptly by the
Buyer or (z) to disclose to the Buyer or its Representatives any information
(A) if doing so would violate any contract or applicable Law to which the
Seller is subject or (B) if the Seller believes in good faith based on advice
of counsel that doing so would jeopardize the ability to assert a claim of
privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges).

Section 6.11. _Outstanding Guarantees_. Following the Closing, the Seller
will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the release, and obtain
customary instruments evidencing such release, of CT REIT Holdings I LLC from
each of the guarantees described in items 21, 22 and 23 of _Schedule
4.15(a)(ii)_ (each, until such date and time as it is released in accordance
with this sentence, an " _Outstanding Guarantee_ ").

 

Section 6.12. _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to the Pollution Policy, without the Buyers prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Seller
will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate that is insured under the Pollution
Policy to, amend, commute, terminate, release, or otherwise modify such policy
in any respect that would modify the coverage afforded to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates who are
insured under the Pollution Policy, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain an endorsement the Pollution Policies that adds the Buyer as an
additional named insured, at the Buyers sole cost and expense. In the event
that the Buyer on the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates on the
other, both submit claims under the Pollution Policy, such claims are pending
at the same time, and satisfaction of both claims would exhaust the remaining
applicable limits of such Pollution Policy, the Buyer and the Seller agree to
apportion the remaining insurance proceeds pro rata according to the ratio,
the numerator of which is the loss of either party (as applicable) and the
denominator of which is the total loss of both parties.

(b) With respect to the Liability Policies, without the Buyers prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Seller
will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate that is insured under the Liability
Policies to, amend, commute, terminate, release, or otherwise modify such
Policies in any respect that would modify the coverage afforded to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary for claims related to pre-Closing occurrences. the
Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates who are insured under
the Liability Policies, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
endorsement to each of the Liability Policies that adds the Buyer as an
additional insured (solely with respect to the Buyers interest in the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries), at the Buyers sole cost and expense.

 



44 (c) The Seller and its Affiliates that are insured under the Subject Policies
may submit claims in accordance with such Subject Policies terms and
conditions, it being understood that erosion of aggregate limits resulting
from such claims activity will not constitute a breach of this provision. From
and after the Closing, the Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates insured
under the Subject Policies, to use commercially reasonable efforts, at the
Buyers sole cost and expense, to assist the Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries in making claims under any Subject Policy, including asserting
its status as an insured under such Subject Policy; provided, that neither the
Seller nor any such Affiliate will bear any liability for the failure of an
insurance carrier to pay any claim if such failure does not result from a
breach of this Agreement.

Section 6.13. _Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Access Agreement, the Seller agrees (a) to extend the Exclusivity Period
until the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 9.1_ ( _Termination_ ) and (b) to comply in all
material respects with the Sellers obligations under _Section 4_
_(Exclusivity)_ of the Access Agreement on the terms, and subject to the
conditions, thereof.

 

Section 6.14. _Title Company_. The Seller covenants to execute and deliver to
the Title Company on or prior to the Closing a duly executed owners
declaration in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D-1_ , a duly executed
non-imputation affidavit in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D-2_ ,

and information required by the Title Company (A) to evidence authority of
the Seller, the Company and Company Subsidiaries, (B) to remove exceptions for
existing deeds of trust, and (C) with regard to recent or current construction
at any Company Property.

In connection with clause (i) and (iii) above, the relevant representation or
warranty will be interpreted without giving effect to any limitation or
qualification as to "materiality," "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or
qualifiers to similar effect set forth in such representation or warranty for
purposes of both (A) determining whether there is an inaccuracy or breach and
(B) the Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to such inaccuracy
or breach.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ), the Buyer agrees, from and after the Closing, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ", and together with
the Buyer Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses suffered by or asserted against any of the Seller Indemnitees arising
from, or in connection with:

 



     | (i) | any inaccuracy in or breach by the Buyer of any of the Buyer
Representations; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any breach by the Buyer of any of the Post-Closing

as to "materiality," "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or qualifiers to
similar effect set forth in such representation or warranty for purposes of
both (A) determining whether there is an inaccuracy or breach and (B) the
Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to such inaccuracy or
breach.

 



50 __(c) The rights of each of the Indemnitees under this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ) are cumulative and each Indemnitee will have the right in
any particular circumstance to enforce any provision of this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ) without regard to the availability of a remedy under any
other provision of this ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ); _provided_ , that
no Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any
provision of this Agreement for any Losses to the extent such Indemnitee or
its Affiliate(s) has been indemnified or reimbursed for the same Losses under
any other provision of this Agreement; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that
duplicative Losses actually recovered by the Company from the Seller will not
also be recoverable by the Buyer Indemnitees. _ _

Section 8.3. _Claims for Indemnification_. All claims for indemnification by
the Indemnitees will be asserted and resolved in accordance with the terms of
this ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ).

(a) To seek indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_
), an Indemnitee will promptly notify the applicable indemnitor (as
applicable, the " _Indemnitor_ ") in writing of the claim, describing the
claim in reasonable detail and the amount, or a reasonable estimation of such
amount made in good faith based on the facts known at the time and not on a
purely speculative basis, of Losses suffered or to be suffered by the
Indemnitee pursuant to the claim (the " _Claims Notice_ "); _provided_ , that
a failure of any Indemnitee to promptly notify the Indemnitor of a claim will
not relieve the Indemnitor from liability for such claim, except and only to
the extent that the Indemnitor actually and materially was prejudiced by such
delay. If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee in writing within
twenty (20) days from its receipt of such Claims Notice that the Indemnitor
disputes such claim, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have accepted and agreed
to indemnify the Indemnitee from and against the entirety of any Losses
described in such Claims Notice. If the Indemnitor has delivered such an
indemnity dispute notice to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee
will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute.

__(b) With respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII ( _Indemnification_ ) that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, each of
the Indemnitee and Indemnitor will reasonably cooperate and assist the other
in determining the validity of such claim and in otherwise resolving such
claim;  _provided_ , that no Person will be required by this clause to
disclose any confidential information or take any action that would reasonably
be expected, at the advice of counsel, to waive or limit any attorney-client
or other similar privilege. __

__(c) With respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII ( _Indemnification_ ) that does involve a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnitor will have twenty (20) days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee in writing that the
Indemnitor desires to assume and to assume, the negotiation, defense or
prosecution of the Third-Party Claim, with counsel of its choice. Should the
Indemnitor so assume the negotiation, defense or prosecution of a Third-Party
Claim, then so long as it diligently conducts such negotiation, defense or
prosecution, the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
negotiation, defense or prosecution thereof, unless the Indemnitee reasonably
determines, upon the advice of external counsel for the Indemnitee, that the
Third- __

 



51  Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially
different defenses for the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, in which case the
Indemnitor will be liable to the Indemnitee for the reasonable expenses of
one counsel for the Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor
will not be entitled assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim (i) to the
extent such claim alleges a violation of criminal law or seeks non-monetary
relief; (ii) if the defense thereof is not assumed within twenty (20) days
after the date on which the Indemnitor received the Claims Notice or (iii) if
the Indemnitor does not conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with
reasonable diligence. Should the Indemnitor so assume the negotiation, defense
or prosecution of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee (i) will have the right
to participate in, but not control, the negotiation, defense or
prosecution thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnitor and (ii) will reasonably cooperate in the
negotiation, defense or prosecution thereof, with such cooperation to include
the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request and at the Indemnitors
expense) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim and the use of reasonable
efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Should the Indemnitor not so assume the negotiation, defense or prosecution
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume such
negotiation, defense or prosecution at the Indemnitors cost and expense.
Regardless of which Party controls the negotiation, defense or prosecution of
a Third-Party Claim, such controlling Party will not admit any Liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without
the other Partys prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that if the
Indemnitor assumes the negotiation, defense or prosecution of a Third-Party
claim, the Indemnitor may pay, settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnitee, so long as such payment,
settlement or compromise (x) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnitee from all Losses in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (y) does not
subject the Indemnitee to any criminal liability or injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy and (z) does not include a statement or admission of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee.

 

Section 8.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No indemnification claims for Losses will be asserted by or payable to the
Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or  _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_
( _Indemnification Obligations_ ) or the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ( _Indemnification Obligations_ ) (i) for any individual
claim, or series of individual claims that are related or that otherwise
arise or result from the same or substantially similar facts and
circumstances, unless the amount of Losses that otherwise would be payable
under the applicable Section for such individual claim or such series of
claims exceeds $25,000 (the " _Per Claim Minimum_ "); and (ii) until the
aggregate amount of all Losses for claims exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_
"), in which case the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees,
as applicable, will be entitled to recover all Losses, except, for the
avoidance of doubt, for such Losses that do not satisfy the Per Claim Minimum;
_provided_ , that the Basket will not apply to any claims for Losses
attributable to actual, knowing and intentional fraud or Losses based on
claims for inaccuracies in or breaches of any Fundamental Representation.

 



52 (b) No indemnification claims for Losses will be asserted by or payable to any
of the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ and _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_ ( _Indemnification Obligations_ ) or any of the Seller
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ( _Indemnification Obligations_ )
for an aggregate amount of Losses in excess of $7,640,000 (the " _Cap_ ");
_provided_ , that the Cap will not apply to claims for Losses attributable to
actual, knowing and intentional fraud or Losses based on claims for
inaccuracies in or breaches of any Fundamental Representation.

(c) No indemnification claims for Losses under this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ) will be asserted by or payable to any of the Buyer
Indemnitees for any Losses to the extent that such Losses were expressly taken
into account in the Closing Statement or any adjustments thereto. In no event
will the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ ( _Indemnification Obligations_ ), on the one hand, or of
the Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ ( _Indemnification Obligations_ ), on
the other hand, in the aggregate exceed the Purchase Price.

(d) The amount of insurance proceeds actually received by an Indemnitee and
its Affiliates in respect of the given Losses for which indemnification is
claimed, _less_ (i) the related reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by such Indemnitee and its Affiliates in recovering such insurance
proceeds and (ii) any actual or reasonably estimated insurance premium
increase attributable to the claim with respect to which such insurance
proceeds are paid, will reduce such Losses that such Indemnitee may recover
under this ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ); _provided_ , that no
Indemnitee will be obligated to pursue any such insurance as a condition to
receipt of indemnification under this Agreement. If an Indemnitee and its
Affiliates receive net insurance proceeds after an indemnification payment
has been made in respect of the Losses to which such net insurance proceeds
relate, then the Indemnitee and its Affiliates promptly will remit such net
insurance proceeds, up to the aggregate amount of indemnification payment in
respect of the Losses to which such net insurance proceeds relate (i) in the
case of the Buyer Indemnitees, to the Seller and (ii) in the case of the
Seller Indemnitees, to the Buyer. The Seller agrees that neither it nor any
of its Affiliates or Representatives will seek, nor will any such Person be
entitled to, reimbursement or contribution from, subrogation to, or
indemnification by the Buyer, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates, under their respective Organizational
Documents or any other contract for indemnification or insurance, or under
this Agreement, applicable Law or otherwise, in respect of any amounts due
from any such Person to any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ) or otherwise in connection with this Agreement.

(e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ) will be measured net of any Tax benefit
actually realized by an Indemnitee and its Affiliates, as a result of the
incurrence of the Losses for which indemnification is sought.

Section 8.5. _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ) will be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller or the
Buyer, as the case may be, within ten (10) Business Days after the
determination of the amount thereof, whether pursuant to a judgment,
settlement or agreement among the Parties.

 



53 Section 8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of (a) matters covered
by  _Section 2.4_ ( _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ) and (b) actual, knowing
and intentional fraud, from and after the Closing, the rights of the Parties
to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII (
_Indemnification_ ) will be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Person with
respect to any matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement.
Subject to the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Parties hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any
matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether under
any Laws or in equity or otherwise.

 

Section 8.7. _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to
this ARTICLE VIII ( _Indemnification_ ) will be considered an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for U.S. federal, state and local Tax purposes, and will be
reported by the Parties as such.

 

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION; REMEDIES

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) if (i) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ ( _Conditions to
Obligations of the Seller and the Company_ ) hereof become incapable of being
satisfied and are not otherwise waived by the Seller or (ii) (A) all of the
conditions set forth _Section 7.1_ ( _Conditions to Obligations of All
Parties_ ) and _Section 7.3_ ( _Conditions to Obligations of the Buyer_ )
hereof have been satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and are
capable of being satisfied at the Closing), and (B) the Closing fails to
occur in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to 5:00 p.m.
(Pacific Time) on April 29, 2016 (the " _Outside Date_ "), then in any such
case, the Seller may elect to terminate this Agreement by giving prompt
written notice to the Buyer. Upon the Buyers receipt of such termination
notice, (x) the Seller and the Buyer will promptly instruct Deposit Escrow
Agent to release the Deposit Escrow Funds to the Seller, (y) upon receipt of
such joint instruction, Deposit Escrow Agent will immediately release the
Deposit Escrow Funds to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified in writing by the Seller as the Sellers sole
and exclusive right and remedy for the failure of the Closing to occur, and
(z) immediately following receipt by the Seller of the Deposit Escrow Funds,
neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall have any further liability to
the other in respect of this Agreement or the Access Agreement, except for
those obligations under this Agreement or the Access Agreement that expressly
survive termination thereof.

 



54 (b) if (i) any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 ( _Conditions to
Obligations of All Parties_ ) or _Section 7.3_ ( _Conditions to Obligations
of the Buyer_ ) hereof become incapable of being satisfied and are not
otherwise waived by the Buyer, or (ii) (A) the Closing does not occur on or
prior to the Outside Date and (B) neither the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.1(a)(i)_ or _9.1(a)(ii)_ hereof are met, then in any such case,
the Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement by giving prompt written
notice to the Seller. Upon the Sellers receipt of such termination notice,
(x) the Seller and the Buyer will promptly instruct Deposit Escrow Agent to
release the Deposit Escrow Funds to the Buyer, (y) upon receipt of such joint
instruction, Deposit Escrow Agent will immediately release the Deposit Escrow
Funds to the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified in writing by the Buyer and (z) immediately following
receipt by the Buyer of the Deposit Escrow Funds, neither the Buyer nor the
Seller shall have any further liability to the other in respect of this
Agreement or the Access Agreement, except for those obligations under this
Agreement or the Access Agreement that expressly survive termination thereof;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall restrict the Buyer
from pursuing a claim against the Seller for actual out of pocket damages
incurred as a result of the Sellers breach of the covenants contained in
Section 7.3 ( _Conditions to Obligations of the Buyer_ ). For the sake of
clarity, in lieu of terminating this Agreement and exercising the foregoing
rights, the Buyer may elect to seek specific performance in accordance with 
_Section 10.11_ _(Specific Performance)_.

Section 9.2. _Casualty and Condemnation_.

 

(a) _Casualty_. As used herein, a " _Significant Casualty_ " means a Casualty
for which (i) the estimated cost of repair or restoration for any individual
Company Property exceeds ten percent (10%) of the allocated share of the
Purchase Price for such Company Property as set forth on _Schedule 2.2_
hereof, (ii) the estimated time to substantially complete such repair or
restoration exceeds twelve (12) months from the date of the Casualty or (iii)
which permits any tenant under a Material Lease to terminate such Material
Lease. If the Seller determines that a Significant Casualty has occurred, the
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a notice thereof together with any estimates
obtained by the Seller from independent contractor(s) substantiating the
threshold levels aforesaid and a list of any tenants who have the right
to terminate their respective Material Leases as a result thereof. If the
Buyer disputes the existence of a Significant Casualty, the Buyer shall
deliver notice to the Seller thereof describing the basis of such dispute in
reasonable detail within five (5) days following the Sellers delivery of
such estimates (a " _Casualty Dispute Notice_ "). Upon delivery of a Casualty
Dispute Notice, such dispute will be resolved by Casualty/Condemnation
Arbitration.

 

(b) _Condemnation_. As used herein, a " _Significant Taking_ " occurs if all
or any part of any Company Property is subject to a taking (other than a
temporary taking), or if the Seller or the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receives an official notice from any Governmental Authority having eminent
domain power over a Company Property of its intention to take, by eminent
domain proceeding, any part of the Company Property (a " _Taking_ "), and if
such Taking (i) involves more than fifteen percent (15%) of the rentable area
of any Company Property, (ii) results in a permanent loss of a material
portion of the parking or access to any Company Property or (iii) which
permits any tenant under a Material Lease to terminate such Material Lease. If
the Seller reasonably determines that a Significant Taking has occurred,
the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a notice of its determination thereof
together any evaluations obtained by the Seller from independent architect(s)
substantiating the threshold levels aforesaid

 



55  and a list of any tenants who have the right to terminate their respective
Material Leases as a result thereof. If the Buyer disputes any such
determination delivered by the Seller, the Buyer shall deliver notice to the
Seller thereof describing the basis of such dispute in reasonable detail
within five (5) days following the Sellers delivery of such determination (a
" _Condemnation Dispute Notice_ "). Upon delivery of a Condemnation Dispute
Notice, such dispute will be resolved by Casualty/Condemnation Arbitration.

(c) _Arbitration_. Any disputes under this _Section 9.2_ ( _Casualty and
Condemnation_ ) will be resolved by expedited arbitration before a single
arbitrator in Wilmington, Delaware acceptable to both of the Seller and the
Buyer in their reasonable judgment in accordance with the rules of the
American Arbitration Association (" _Casualty/Condemnation Arbitration_ ");
_provided_ , that if the Seller and the Buyer fail to agree on an arbitrator
within five (5) days after a dispute arises, then either Party may request
the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Wilmington,
Delaware to designate an arbitrator. In the event of a dispute regarding a
potential Significant Casualty, such arbitrator will be an independent
architect or engineer who is impartial and has no existing or historical
personal professional relationship with the Seller, the Buyer or their
respective Affiliates, having at least ten (10) years of experience in the
construction of industrial buildings in the State in which the Company
Property is located. In the event of a dispute regarding a potential
Significant Taking, such arbitrator will be an independent architect having at
least ten (10) years of experience in the construction of
industrial/warehouse buildings in the State in which such Company Property is
located. The costs and expenses of such arbitrator will be borne equally by
the Seller and the Buyer.

monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to _Section 9.1_
_(Termination)_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that each of the Parties
will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without proof of
damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties are
entitled under this Agreement. Subject to _Section 9.1_ _(Termination),_
each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Subject to _Section 9.1_
_(Termination),_ the Parties acknowledge and agree that no Party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and/or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 10.11_ will be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such action.

 

Section 10.12. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction and this
Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

 



60 Section 10.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT.

 

Section 10.14. _Facsimile or PDF Signature_. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf
signature will constitute an original for all purposes.

Section 10.15. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with regard to all
dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.16. _Legal Representation_.

(a) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) acknowledges and agrees
that Ropes and Gray LLP (the " _Seller Party Transaction Counsel_ ") has acted
as counsel for the Seller, the Company and, where applicable, their respective
affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Acquisition Engagement_ "), and the
Seller Party Transaction Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person
with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, including the Buyer.

(b) Only the Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, will be considered clients of the Seller Party Transaction
Counsel in connection with the Acquisition Engagement. The Buyer, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company),
acknowledges and agrees that all confidential communications between
the Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Seller Party Transaction Counsel, on the other hand, and any attendant
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection and expectation of
client confidentiality applicable thereto, will be deemed to belong solely to
the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and not the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and will
not pass to or be claimed, held or used by the Buyer or the Company upon or
after the Closing, in each case to the extent relating to the Acquisition
Engagement. Accordingly, the Buyer will not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of the Seller Party Transaction Counsel,
whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that files of the
Seller Party Transaction Counsel constitute client property and to the extent
that such files relate to the Acquisition Engagement, only the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) will
hold such property rights and (ii) the Seller Party Transaction Counsel will
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files, in each case to the extent related to the Acquisition
Engagement, to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Buyer by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Seller Party
Transaction Counsel

 



61  and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise; _provided_
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Party Transaction Counsel
will not disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any
third parties (other than representatives, accountants and advisors of the
Seller and its Affiliates who are instructed to maintain the confidence of
such attorney-client communications). If and to the extent that, at any time
subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including after
the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) has the right to assert
or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between the Company or its Affiliates and any Person representing any of them
that occurred at any time prior to the Closing and to the extent relating to
the Acquisition Engagement, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) will be entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior
written consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(c) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees
that the Seller Party Transaction Counsel has acted as counsel for the Seller,
the Company, and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, and may continue
to represent the Seller and/or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), as applicable, in future matters. Accordingly, the
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), expressly (i) consents to the
Seller Party Transaction Counsels representation of the Seller and its
Affiliates and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing
Persons so desire) in any matter, including any post-Closing matter in which
the interests of the Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, on the other hand,
are adverse, including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and whether or not such matter is one in which the Seller
Party Transaction Counsel may have previously advised the Seller, the Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable and (ii) consents to the
disclosure by the Seller Party Transaction Counsel to the Seller and its
Affiliates, of any information learned by the Seller Party Transaction Counsel
in the course of its representation of the Seller, the Company, or any of
their respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or the Seller
Party Transaction Counsels duty of confidentiality.

__(d) The Seller, the Company and the Buyer consent to the arrangements in
this _Section 10.16_ ( _Legal Representation_ ), and waive any actual or
potential conflict of interest that may be involved in connection with any
representation by the Seller Party Transaction Counsel permitted hereunder.
__

Section 10.17. _Deposit Escrow Agent._

 

(a) In the event of any disagreement between the Seller and the Buyer
resulting in conflicting or adverse claims or demands made in connection with
the Deposit Escrow Funds, Deposit Escrow Agent will be entitled, at its
option, to refuse to comply with any such claims or demands so long as the
disagreement will continue, and in so doing Deposit Escrow Agent will not be
liable for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting or

 



62  adverse claims or demands until the rights of the claimants have been
finally adjudicated or the differences adjusted between the Seller and the
Buyer and Deposit Escrow Agent has been notified thereof in writing signed by
each of the Seller and the Buyer. Deposit Escrow Agent will also have the
right to bring an action in interpleader to obtain the right to pay said sum
to a court of competent jurisdiction, deducting from said sum the costs
incurred in bringing such an action.

(b) In the event of any dispute or litigation affecting Deposit Escrow Agents
duties relating to this Agreement, Deposit Escrow Agent may consult legal
counsel and will incur no liability and will be fully protected in acting in
good faith in accordance with the opinion of counsel; provided that nothing
herein will release or discharge Deposit Escrow Agent from liability to the
extent it is adjudged negligent or to have acted (or failed to act) in bad
faith. Deposit Escrow Agent will be indemnified and saved harmless by the
Buyer and the Seller, jointly and severally, from all losses, costs and
expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys fees, as a result of its
involvement in any litigation arising from performance of its duties
hereunder, provided that such litigation does not result from any
action taken or omitted by Deposit Escrow Agent and for which it has been
adjudged negligent or to have acted (or failed to act) in bad faith; such
indemnification will survive termination of this Agreement until extinguished
by the applicable statute of limitations.

(c) Deposit Escrow Agent may be removed and replaced following the giving of
at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Deposit Escrow Agent by both
the Seller and the Buyer. The duties of Deposit Escrow Agent will terminate
ten (10) days after the date of such notice, or on such later date as may be
specified in such notice or as of such earlier date as may be mutually agreed
upon by Deposit Escrow Agent and each of the Seller and the Buyer. Deposit
Escrow Agent will then deliver the Deposit Escrow Funds to a successor escrow
agent as will be appointed by the Seller and the Buyer, as evidenced by a
written notice filed with Deposit Escrow Agent. If the Seller and the Buyer
are unable to agree upon a successor, or will have failed to appoint a
successor prior to the expiration of ten (10) days following the date of the
notice of removal, the removed Deposit Escrow Agent may apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction in order to request the appointment of a successor
escrow agent or other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment
will be binding upon each of the Seller and the Buyer unless and until
another successor will have been appointed pursuant to this paragraph.

63 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the date first written above.
