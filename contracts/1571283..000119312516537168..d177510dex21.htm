Seller and the Company and will not be subject to further appeal. If, at the end of the foregoing period, there remain any unresolved disputed items, those unresolved disputed items will be referred to a nationally-recognized, U.S.-based accounting

from the date on which the dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm), whether any of the Closing Cash, Closing Reserves, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Adjustment Amount or Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment.
The Accounting Firm will be instructed that, in making such determination, it may only consider matters still in dispute between the Buyer and the Seller and may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
