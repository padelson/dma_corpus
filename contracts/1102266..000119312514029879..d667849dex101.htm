in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , dated as of the date hereof, with
First Southern, pursuant to which each such director has agreed, among other
things, to vote all of the CenterState Common Stock owned by such director in
favor of the issuance of CenterState Common Stock in connection with this

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the " _FBCA_ "), at the
Effective Time, First Southern shall merge with and into CenterState.
CenterState shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue
its existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of First Southern shall
cease.

 



1 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
simultaneously with the Closing, the Parties shall execute, and CenterState
shall cause to be filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida
and the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, articles of merger as
provided in the FBCA (the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are filed or such other time
as may be specified in such Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the FBCA.

 

1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of First Southern, CenterState or the holders of any of the
following securities, at the Effective Time:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of CenterState ("
_CenterState Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01, of the Surviving Company.

 

(b) Subject to Sections 1.4(c), 1.4(d), and 1.4(e), each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of First Southern (the " _First Southern
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, including Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares, but
excluding any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares (collectively, the "
_Exchangeable Shares_ ," and each an " _Exchangeable Share_ "), shall be
converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, into the
right to receive: (i) 0.3 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of CenterState
Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) $3.00 plus
any dividends payable in accordance with Section 2.2(c), and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.2(f), (collectively, the "
_Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
prior to the Effective Time, all the outstanding shares of First Southerns
Common Equivalent Convertible Participating Voting Preferred Stock, Series C
(the " _Series C Preferred Stock_ "), shall be converted into First Southern
Common Stock (or First Southern Non-Voting Common Stock, if required by the
Certificate of Designations, _provided_ that such First Southern Non-Voting
Common Stock will be treated as First Southern Common Stock and Exchangeable
Shares for purposes of this Agreement) in accordance with the provisions of
the Certificate of Designations for the Series C Preferred Stock set forth in
the Articles of Amendment to the articles of incorporation of First Southern
(the " _Certificate of Designations_ "), and such converted shares of Series
C Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes hereunder, including
payment of the Merger Consideration, as First Southern Common Stock and
Exchangeable Shares. All of the Exchangeable Shares converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any
such shares of First Southern Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and
non-certificated share of First Southern Common Stock represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration into which

 



2  the shares of First Southern Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.2(f), as well as
any dividends to which holders of First Southern Common Stock become entitled
in accordance with Section 2.2(c).

 

(c) All shares of First Southern Common Stock that are owned by First Southern
or CenterState (other than (i) shares of First Southern Common Stock held in
trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held
in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third
parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and (ii) shares
of First Southern Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by First Southern
or CenterState in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, "
_DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist (any such
shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no stock of CenterState or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of First
Southern Common Stock that are owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of First
Southern or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of CenterState shall remain
outstanding, adjusted to maintain relative ownership percentages, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
First Southern Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in
favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to
demand and properly demands the fair value of such shares pursuant to, and
who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Sections 607.1301 to
607.1333 of the FBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
instead the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections
607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect such holders right to receive, or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to demand or receive, the fair value of such shares of First
Southern Common Stock under such provisions of the FBCA. If any shareholder
dissenting pursuant to Sections 607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA and this
Section 1.4(d) shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of First Southern Common
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
Exchangeable Shares as of the Effective Time, eligible to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(b), without any interest
thereon. First Southern shall give CenterState (i) prompt notice of any
written notices to exercise dissenters rights in respect of any shares of
First Southern Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any
other instruments served pursuant to the FBCA and received by First Southern
relating to dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the
FBCA. First Southern shall not, except with the prior written consent of
CenterState, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer
or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. 

(e) If the number of shares of CenterState Common Stock or First Southern
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result
of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock, and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be
proportionately adjusted as necessary to preserve the relative economic
benefit to the Parties.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall appoint
its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to
an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to First Southern (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") hereunder.

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Promptly (and within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
First Southern Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(b), including any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of such Certificate)) to the Exchange Agent and which shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering a Certificate in exchange for
the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration therefor.

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates,
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of First
Southern Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective
Time the Merger Consideration, including any dividends that are payable to
CenterState shareholders of record as of any date on or after the Closing
Date and cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of First
Southern Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until
so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the
Merger Consideration, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in accordance with the
provisions of this Article II. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each
holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter) pay to the holder, the Merger Consideration for
each Book-Entry Share and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and
any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c).

 



8 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.4(b), no dividends or other
distributions with respect to CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
CenterState Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until
the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject
to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article
II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares
of CenterState Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and not paid or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of CenterState
Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with
a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the CenterState Common Stock
issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
First Southern Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of First Southern, the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock and dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) shall be issued or paid in exchange
therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such First
Southern Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance
shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of CenterState that the tax has
been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Time, CenterState) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash consideration or cash in lieu of fractional
shares of CenterState Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of First Southern Common Stock such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or CenterState, as the case may be, is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are
so withheld by the Exchange Agent or CenterState, as the case may be, and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of First Southern Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or CenterState,
as the case may be. For purposes of Section 1.5, any required withholding
shall be satisfied by the applicable holder tendering to the Surviving
Company, the Exchange Agent or CenterState, as applicable, a number of shares
of CenterState Common Stock with a fair market value equal to the amount
required to be withheld.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of First Southern of the shares of First Southern Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than to settle transfers of First Southern Common Stock that occurred prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares

 



9  of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
and any dividends or distributions to which the holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article
II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock shall be issued to the holder
of Book-Entry Shares or upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with respect to CenterState Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of CenterState. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, CenterState shall pay to each former shareholder of First
Southern who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying
(i) the Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking
into account all shares of First Southern Common Stock held by such holder at
the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of CenterState Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as CenterState may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FIRST SOUTHERN

 

Except as Previously Disclosed, First Southern hereby represents and warrants
to CenterState as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

(b) CenterState shall, and shall cause its Board of Directors to, (i) take
all action in accordance with the federal securities laws, the FBCA and the

(a) Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are employed by First Southern and its Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits
and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly situated employees of
CenterState or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen plan of CenterState or its Subsidiaries. CenterState shall
give the Covered Employees full credit for their prior service with First
Southern and its Subsidiaries (i) for purposes of eligibility (including
initial participation and eligibility for current benefits) and vesting under
any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit plan maintained by CenterState
and in which Covered Employees may be eligible to participate and (ii) for
all purposes under any defined contribution retirement plans, welfare benefit
plans, vacation plans, severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by
CenterState.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of CenterState that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is
eligible to participate following the Closing Date, CenterState or its
applicable Subsidiary shall (i) cause any pre-existing condition limitations
or eligibility waiting periods under such CenterState or Subsidiary plan to
be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been covered under
the First Southern Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any health,
dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered Employee or
his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of any applicable co-payment, deductible or annual out-of-pocket
expense requirements under any such health, dental, vision or other welfare
plan.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, First Southern shall take, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by CenterState that may be
necessary or appropriate to (i) cause the First Southern Benefits Plans set
forth on Section 6.5(c) of the First Southern Disclosure

 



49  Schedule to terminate as of the Effective Time, or as of the date
immediately preceding the Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and
entitlements under any such First Southern Benefit Plan to cease as of the
Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective Time,
(iii) cause the continuation on and after the Effective Time of any contract,
arrangement or insurance policy relating to any such First Southern Benefit
Plan for such period as may be requested by CenterState, or (iv) facilitate
the merger of any such First Southern Benefit Plan into any employee benefit
plan maintained by CenterState or an CenterState Subsidiary. All resolutions,
notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 6.5(c) shall be subject to CenterStates
reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed (i) to limit the right of

Southern Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such
amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan,

the Closing Date, First Southern and its Subsidiaries) to retain the
employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date, or (iii) to amend any First Southern Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit plan, arrangement or agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _First Southern Benefit Plans_ " means
any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and all
other benefit plans, arrangements or agreements, including any other
employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation,
stock option or other equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change
of control, profit-sharing, insurance, split dollar insurance, fringe benefit
or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether written or
unwritten, whether or not subject to ERISA, or whether formal or
informal, for the benefit of any employee, former employee, director or
former director of First Southern or any of its Subsidiaries entered into,
maintained or contributed to by First Southern or any of its Subsidiaries or
to which First Southern or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to
contribute, or with respect to which First Southern or any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, other than any
Multiemployer Plan.

 

(f) If, within twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, any Covered
Employee is terminated by CenterState or its Subsidiaries other than "for
cause," then CenterState shall pay severance to such Covered Employee in an
amount equal to two weeks of base salary for each twelve months of such
Covered Employees prior employment with First Southern or First
Southern Bank; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the total
amount of severance for any single Covered Employee be less than four weeks of
such base salary nor greater than twenty-six weeks of such base salary. Any
severance to which a Covered Employee may be entitled in connection with a
termination occurring more than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
will be as set forth in the severance policies of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries as then in effect.

 

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, First Southern has entered into
agreements that terminate, at the Effective Time, the employment, consulting,
severance, change in control, or similar agreements or arrangements with the
individuals set forth on Section 6.5(g) of the First Southern Disclosure
Schedule with any confidentiality, noncompetition and nonsolicitation 

 



50  provisions contained in such agreements and arrangements remaining in full
force and effect following the Effective Time for a period of one year. The
foregoing terminations shall be for payment amounts not to exceed those set
forth on Section 6.5(g) of the First Southern Disclosure Schedule.

(h) At the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all employees
of First Southern and its subsidiaries and relating to periods prior to
January 1, 2014 shall terminate (without any payment therefor by First
Southern and its Subsidiaries) and not carried over to, or assumed by
CenterState or its Subsidiaries.

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, CenterState shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of
First Southern and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, settlements or liabilities as incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a " _Claim_ "),
arising out of actions or omissions of such Persons in the course
of performing their duties for First Southern occurring at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), to the
greatest extent as such persons are indemnified or have the right to
advancement of expenses pursuant to (i) the First Southern Charter, the First
Southern Bylaws or the articles or certificate of incorporation or formation
and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of First Southerns
Subsidiaries, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the
FBCA.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.6 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of CenterState under
this Section 6.6 unless, and only to the extent that, CenterState is actually
and materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In
the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) CenterState shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
CenterState shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , that
CenterState shall not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any such Claim unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Parties from all
liability arising out of such Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) CenterState shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld) and (iv) CenterState shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, CenterState
will provide directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of First Southern or its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and officers
arising from facts or events occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain
at least the same coverage and amounts, and 

 



51  contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party,
as the coverage currently provided by First Southern; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) if CenterState is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 6.6(c) then CenterState will provide as much comparable
insurance as is reasonably available, (ii) officers and directors of First
Southern or its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance, and (iii) in satisfaction of its
obligations under this Section 6.6(c), CenterState may purchase, prior to but
effective as of the Effective Time, tail insurance providing such coverage as
described in this sentence. Whether or not CenterState shall procure such
coverage, in no event shall CenterState be required to expend for such tail
insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 250% of the annual
premiums paid by First Southern for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum D andO Tail Premium_"). If the cost of such tail
insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, then CenterState shall obtain
tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

(d) If CenterState or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.
The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

6.7 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) First Southern agrees that, except as expressly permitted by Section
6.7(b), from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, it
will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
officers, directors, and employees (the " _First Southern Individuals_ ") not
to, and will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause First
Southern and its Subsidiaries agents, advisors, accountants, legal counsel,
and financial advisors (the " _First Southern Representatives_ ") not to,
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any discussions or negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties or assets (" _First
Southern Confidential Information_ ") to, or have any discussions with, any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal. First Southern will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than
CenterState with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
commercially reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to enforce
any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to such an Acquisition
Proposal. It is understood that any breach of the provisions of this Section
6.7 by any First Southern Representative shall constitute a breach by First
Southern.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.7(a), at any time
from the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the First Southern
Shareholder Approval, in the event First Southern receives an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors 

 



52  of First Southern determines in good faith that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Proposal, First Southern may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and the First Southern Individuals and the First Southern
Representatives to, (i) negotiate the terms of, and enter into, a
confidentiality agreement with terms and conditions no less favorable in the
aggregate to First Southern than the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) furnish
or cause to be furnished First Southern Confidential Information to the Person
or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement, and (iii) negotiate and participate in such
negotiations or discussions with the Person or Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal concerning such Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of
First Southern determines in good faith (following consultation with counsel)
that failure to take such actions would or would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 

(c) Subject to the succeeding sentence, the Board of Directors of First
Southern shall not (nor shall any committee thereof) withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to CenterState, the First Southern Board Recommendation or make
or cause to be made any third party or public communication proposing or
announcing an intention to withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to
CenterState the First Southern Board Recommendation (any such action, a "
_Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the First
Southern Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (after consultation with its legal advisors) that
failure to do so could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of First Southern under applicable laws, the First Southern
Board of Directors may at any time prior to the First Southern Shareholder
Approval (i) effect a Change in Recommendation or (ii) terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of First
Southern may not make a Change in Recommendation, or terminate this Agreement,
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal unless (i) First Southern shall
not have breached this Section 6.7 in any material respect and (ii) (A) the
Board of Directors of First Southern determines in good faith (after
consultation with counsel) that such Superior Proposal has been made and has
not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
CenterState under this Section 6.7(c); (B) First Southern has given
CenterState at least three (3) days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action set forth above (which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the Person making such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided
an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
Person making such Superior Proposal; and (C) before effecting such Change in
Recommendation, First Southern has negotiated, and has caused its
representatives to negotiate, in good faith with CenterState during such
notice period to the extent CenterState wishes to negotiate, to enable
CenterState to revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. In
the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal, First
Southern shall, in each case, be required to deliver to CenterState a new
written notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and First Southern
shall be required to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.7 with
respect to such new written notice.

 



53 (d) First Southern will advise CenterState in writing within twenty-four (24)
hours following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep CenterState apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a current basis.

forth below:

business combination or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner in a
single transaction or series of transactions more than fifty percent (50%) of
the voting power in, or more than twenty percent (20%) of the fair market
value of the business, assets or deposits of, First Southern and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of First Southern concludes in good faith to be more favorable to
its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be
a nationally recognized investment banking firm, CenterState acknowledging
that Keefe Bruyette is a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii)
after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction
on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal
(with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms
of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any
other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_
, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references
to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%).

 

6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Parties shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein; _provided_ , that any failure to give such notice in accordance with
the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of a condition contained in
Article VII unless the underlying breach would independently result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII. Each of the Parties shall
promptly inform the other in writing upon receiving notice of any material
Action by any Governmental Entity or third party against, or threatened
against, it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
properties, or any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
their individual capacities as such.

6.9 _System Integration_. From and after the date hereof, subject to
applicable law and regulation, First Southern shall cause First Southern Bank

to, cooperate and assist First Southern Bank and CenterState Bank of Florida,
N.A. in connection

 



54  with an electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable data of First
Southern Bank to the CenterState system following the Effective Time,
including the training of First Southern Bank employees without undue
disruption to First Southern Banks business, during normal business hours and
at the expense of CenterState (not to include First Southern Banks standard
employee payroll).

 

6.10 _Coordination; Integration_. Subject to applicable law and regulation,
during the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time, First
Southern shall cause the Chief Executive Officer of First Southern Bank or, if
such Person is unavailable, another senior officer thereof, to assist and
confer with the officers of CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A., on a weekly
basis, relating to the development, coordination and implementation of the
post-Merger operating and integration plans of CenterState Bank of Florida,
N.A., as the resulting institution in the Bank Merger; _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding the conversion of the core processing and other data
processing and information systems of First Southern and First Southern Bank
in conjunction with the Bank Merger, and subject to applicable provisions of
law and non-objection from any Governmental Entity, the former banking
offices of First Southern Bank shall continue to operate and shall conduct
business under the name "First Southern Bank, a division of CenterState Bank
of Florida, N.A." for a period up to 12 months after completion of the Bank
Merger, and shall continue to use signage, stationery and marketing materials
in such name, for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening existing
banking relationships and ensuring a seamless transition of the operations of
First Southern Bank to CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A. At no time prior to
December 31, 2014 shall the present signage at the offices of First Southern
Bank be covered with temporary signs or banners bearing the name or logo
of CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A.

commercially reasonable best efforts to cause, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and effective upon Closing, each non-
employee director of First Southern to execute and deliver the Non-Competition
and Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
(collectively, the " _Director Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ ").

6.12  _Claims Letters_. First Southern has used commercially reasonable best
efforts to cause, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective upon the Closing, each director of First Southern to
execute and deliver the Claims Letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E.

6.13 _Tax Treatment_. Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to use its reasonable
best efforts to take no action which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

6.14 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. In the event that either Party
determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot
be fulfilled and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly
notify the other Party.

 

6.15 _Corporate Governance_. At or prior to the Effective Time, CenterState,
if it so elects, may cause one member of the Board of Directors of First

or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and

prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party shall not be permitted to

is attributable to the failure of such Party to perform any covenant in this
Agreement required to be performed prior to the Effective Time;

 

(iii) by either First Southern or CenterState, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before 270 days following the date of this Agreement,
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(iv) by either First Southern or CenterState (provided that the terminating
Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a
breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of First Southern, in the
case of a termination by CenterState, or CenterState, in the case of a
termination by First Southern, which breach, either individually or in the
aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by CenterState, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by
First Southern, and which is not cured within twenty (20) Business Days
following written notice to the Party committing such breach or by its nature
or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

(v) by CenterState if (i) the Board of Directors of First Southern (or any

subject, however, to the following three sentences. First Southern must elect
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(a)(x) within two (2)
Business Days after the Determination Date. If First Southern elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(x), it shall
give written notice to CenterState (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned two-Business
Day period). Within one (1) Business Day following its receipt of such notice,
CenterState shall have the option to increase the Per Share Cash Consideration
by an amount equal to the Pricing Differential, _provided_ , _however_ , that
CenterState shall not be permitted to increase the Per Share Cash
Consideration in a manner that would cause the failure of the conditions set

give written notice to First Southern of such election and the amount of the
increase in the Per Share Cash Consideration within the one (1) Business Day
period following its receipt of notice of termination from First Southern,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section
8.1(a)(x) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its

recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date,
the prices for the CenterState Common Stock and other values used in this
Section 8.1(a)(x) shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying
Section 1.4 and this Section 8.1(a)(x) as necessary to preserve the relative
economic benefit to the Parties.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either First Southern or CenterState as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of First
Southern, CenterState, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever under this Agreement, or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this
Section 8.2 and Sections 6.2(e), 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9
and 9.10 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) termination
will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful
and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 8.4 and with
respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement,
which shall be borne equally by CenterState and First Southern, and all filing
and other fees in connection with any filing with the SEC relating to the
Merger, which shall be borne by CenterState, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, this Agreement, and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
_provided_ that nothing contained herein shall limit either Partys rights to
recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other Partys willful
and material 

 



62  breach of any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any legal action or other proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement is brought by a Party against the other Party, the prevailing Party
in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all reasonable
expenses relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses,

with such termination, pay CenterState the Termination Fee, in each case by
wire transfer of same-day funds.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Party under Section
8.1(a)(vii), and prior to the First Southern Shareholder Meeting there has
been publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal, then if
within six (6) months of such termination First Southern or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries either (i) enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) consummates such Acquisition
Proposal, First Southern shall, within three (3) Business Days after the first
to occur of entering into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal or consummating such Acquisition Proposal, pay
CenterState the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds. For
purposes of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the references to
twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to fifty percent (50%).

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by First Southern pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(viii), or (ii) by First Southern pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iv)
following a material breach by CenterState of any of the provisions of Section
6.1 (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not be deemed to include a failure
to comply with the provisions therein that provide for a specific filing
deadline with respect to applications or filings with Governmental Entities),
CenterState shall, within three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay
First Southern the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than in
the case of a willful and material breach of this Agreement, the payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall fully discharge the
Party paying such Termination Fee from, and be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the other Party with respect to, any and all losses that may be suffered
by such other Party based upon, resulting from or arising out of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination of this Agreement. In no event
shall First Southern or CenterState be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

(e) The Parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 



63 8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with this Agreement by
the shareholders of First Southern or CenterState; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the shareholders of First Southern or CenterState, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that
requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
on the part of the other Party or (c) waive compliance with any of the

shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

This Shareholder Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
the 29th day of January, 2014, by and between CenterState Banks, Inc., a
Florida corporation (" _CenterState_ "), and the undersigned holder ("
_Shareholder_ ") of Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Shareholder "beneficially owns" (as such term
is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) and is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition
of) and to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of voting
common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of First
Southern Bancorp, Inc. (" _First Southern_ "), indicated on the signature page
of this Agreement under the heading "Total Number of Shares of Common Stock
Subject to this Agreement" (such shares of Common Stock, which for the
avoidance of doubt shall not include any shares of Common Stock underlying

the voting power over which is acquired by Shareholder during the period from
and including the date hereof through and including the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, CenterState and First Southern propose to enter into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ ";
for purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, First Southern will
merge with and into CenterState (the " _Merger_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Shareholder is executing this Agreement; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by CenterState in connection therewith,
Shareholder and CenterState, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that, while this Agreement
is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of First Southern, however
called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which
Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as
otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by CenterState, Shareholder shall:

(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to
which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct
the voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including,

 



A-1  without limitation, any amendments or modifications of the terms thereof
adopted in accordance with the terms thereof); (ii) against any action or
agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of First Southern contained in
the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (iii)
against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or
transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede,
interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially
and adversely affect consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or this Agreement.

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of First Southern, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

2\. _No Transfers_. While this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder agrees not
to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise
dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement
or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or
other disposition of, any of the Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or operation of
law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; (b) transfers
pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement; (d) disposing of or surrendering Shares in connection
with the vesting, settlement or exercise of First Southern Stock Options or
First Southern Restricted Shares for the payment of taxes thereon or, in the
case of First Southern Stock Options, the exercise price or in connection with
the repurchase, redemption or cancellation of any First Southern Restricted
Shares as permitted pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (e) such transfers
as CenterState may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or
other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null
and void.

 

3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents
and warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows: 

(a) Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general
principles of equity.

 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, 

 



A-2  arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by
which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which
Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter,
bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

 

(d) Shareholder is the beneficial owner of the Shares. Shareholder does not
own, of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of First Southern
other than the Shares or any other securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for such capital stock, other than any First Southern Stock
Options. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and none of the Shares
is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction
with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this
Agreement or provided by the FBCA.

 

4\. _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 hereof, Shareholder, in his, her or its
capacity as a shareholder of First Southern, shall not, nor shall Shareholder
authorize any shareholder, member, partner, officer, director, advisor or
representative of Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates to (and,
to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or
knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making
of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish,
or otherwise afford access, to any person (other than CenterState) any
information or data with respect to First Southern or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle,
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit proxies with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger and the Merger Agreement) or
otherwise encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action that
would compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit
the timely consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, or (e) initiate a shareholders vote or action by consent
of First Southerns shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case, except to the extent that at such time First Southern is permitted
to take such action pursuant to Section 6.7 of the Merger Agreement. For
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict Shareholder or any of his, her or its
affiliates who is or becomes during the term hereof a member of the Board of
Directors or an officer of First Southern or any of its Subsidiaries from
acting, omitting to act or refraining from taking any action, solely in such
persons capacity as a member of the Board of Directors or as an officer of
First Southern (or as an officer or director of any of its Subsidiaries),
including without limitation actions taken consistent with his or her
fiduciary duties in such capacity under applicable law.

 

5\. _Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5, by execution of
this Agreement, Shareholder does hereby appoint CenterState with full power
of substitution and resubstitution, as Shareholders true and lawful attorney
and proxy, to the full extent of Shareholders rights with respect to the
Shares, to vote each of such Shares that Shareholder shall be entitled to so
vote with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof at any meeting
of the shareholders of First Southern, and at any adjournment or postponement
thereof, and in connection with 

 



A-3  any action of the shareholders of First Southern taken by written consent.
Shareholder hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with
respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, this proxy shall automatically terminate and be revoked upon the
termination of this Agreement.

 

6\. _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys  Fees_. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to
enter into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement and that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to
CenterState if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by
this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will
not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder
agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate
remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief
on the basis that CenterState has an adequate remedy at law. In addition,
CenterState shall have the right to inform any third party that CenterState
reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with
Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState
hereunder, and that participation by any such thirty party with Shareholder
in activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with CenterState set
forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such
third party. In any legal action or other proceeding relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or if the enforcement of
any provision of this Agreement is brought against either Party, the
prevailing Party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all
reasonable expenses relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, court costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and
post-judgment proceedings) from the Party against which such action or
proceeding is brought, in addition to any other relief to which such
prevailing Party may be entitled.

7\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement
shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement by the written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement
shall be automatically terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger. Upon such termination, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful
and material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

8.  _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 

9\. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement.

 



A-4 10\. _Capacity as Shareholder_. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder
solely in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of First Southern, and it
shall not apply in any manner to Shareholder in any capacity as a director,
officer or employee of First Southern or its Subsidiaries or in any other
capacity, and shall not limit or affect any actions taken by Shareholder in
such capacity.

11\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.

 

12\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF
THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.

13\. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal
or rights to dissent from the Merger or to demand fair value for his, her or
its Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case, that Shareholder may
have under applicable law. Shareholder further agrees not to commence or
participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in
any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against
CenterState, First Southern or any of their respective successors relating to
the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger. From time to time prior to the
termination of this Agreement, at CenterStates request and without further
consideration, Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable
to effect the actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

14\. _Disclosure_. Shareholder hereby permits CenterState and First Southern
to publish and disclose in the Proxy Statement and Form S-4 (including,
without limitation, all related documents and schedules filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission) his, her or its identity and ownership of
shares of Common Stock and the nature of Shareholders commitments,
arrangements and understandings pursuant to this Agreement.

 



A-5 15\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Executed counterparts
may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be partially
or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall be
deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent necessary to make such
provision valid, binding and enforceable, or, if such provision cannot be
modified or restricted in a manner so as to make such provision valid, binding
and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be excised from this
Agreement and the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any manner.

 

No waiver, amendment, modification or change of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless and until made in writing and signed by
the Banks. No waiver, forbearance or failure by any Bank of its rights to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or estoppel
of such Banks right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement or a
continuing waiver by such Bank of compliance with any provision hereof.

Except to the extent Federal law is applicable hereto, this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Florida without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

 

This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Banks respective successors and permitted assigns.

Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, this Agreement shall not benefit or
create any right of action in or on behalf of any person or entity other than
the Banks.

 



C-4 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
optically-scanned electronic mail attachment), each of which shall be deemed
to be original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

Agreement effective as of the date and year first set forth above.

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the " _Agreement_ "), is
entered into as of the 29th day of January, 2014, by and between CenterState
Banks, Inc., a Florida corporation (" _CenterState_ "), and
, an individual resident of the State of Florida (" _Director_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
January 29, 2014 (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and between CenterState and
First Southern Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation (" _First Southern_ "),
First Southern will merge with and into CenterState (the " _Merger_ "), as a
result of which First Southern Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank and
subsidiary of First Southern (" _First Southern Bank_ "), will merge with and
into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and wholly owned
subsidiary of CenterState (" _CenterState Bank, N.A._ ");

WHEREAS, Director is a shareholder of First Southern and, as a result of the
Merger and pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
Director is expected to receive significant consideration in exchange for the
shares of First Southern Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
held by Director;

 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
Board of Directors of First Southern, and, therefore, Director has knowledge
of the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined); and

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information, for which CenterState, as of the Effective Time (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), will have paid valuable consideration and
desires reasonable protection; and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
certain directors of First Southern, including Director, enter into this
Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending
to be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

1\. _Restrictive Covenants_. 

(a) Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for
the restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods
of restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

 



D-1 (b) Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use for
purposes of engaging in a Competitive Activity any Confidential Information
for so long as such information remains Confidential Information, except for
any disclosure that is required by applicable law or court order. In
the event that Director is required by law or court order to disclose any
Confidential Information, Director will: (i) if and to the extent permitted by
such law or court order provide CenterState with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to the disclosure so that CenterState may waive the
requirements of this Agreement or seek an appropriate protective order at
CenterStates sole expense; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain assurances that any Confidential Information disclosed will be
accorded confidential treatment. If, in the absence of a waiver or protective
order, Director is nonetheless, in the opinion of his counsel, required to
disclose Confidential Information, disclosure may be made only as to that
portion of the Confidential Information that counsel advises Director is
required to be disclosed.

(ii) Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), on Directors own behalf or in the service
or on behalf of others, solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of
CenterState, CenterState Bank, N.A., First Southern or First Southern Bank
(each a " _Protected Party_ "), including actively sought prospective
customers of First Southern Bank as of the Effective Time, for the purpose of
engaging in any Competitive Activity (as hereinafter defined).

 

(iii) Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Directors
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the business conducted by any Protected Party, as such
business is conducted as of the date hereof, and which has an office located
within the Restricted Territory.

(iv) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years
after the Effective Time, Director will not on Directors own behalf or in
the service or on behalf of others, solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit
or recruit, directly or by assisting others, any employee of any Protected
Party, whether or not such employee is a full-time employee or a temporary
employee of such Protected Party, whether or not such employment is pursuant
to a written agreement and whether or not such employment is for a determined
period or is at will, to cease working for such Protected Party; provided,
that the foregoing will not prevent the placement of any general solicitation
of employment not specifically directed towards employees of any Protected
Party or hiring any such person as a result thereof.

 

(c) For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as
set forth below:

 

(i) " _Competitive Activity_ " means the business of providing retail or
commercial banking services through bank branches located in the Restricted
Territory.

 



D-2 (ii) " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean all non-public data and
information:

(A) relating to the business of First Southern and its subsidiaries, including
First Southern Bank;

 

(B) disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence
of Directors relationship with First Southern as a director;

(C) having value to First Southern and, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, CenterState; and

(D) not generally known to competitors of First Southern or CenterState.

Confidential Information shall include non-public methods of operation, names
of customers, price lists, financial information and projections, personnel
data and similar non-public information; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
term "Confidential Information" shall not mean data or information that (x)
has been disclosed to the public, except where such public disclosure has
been made by Director without authorization from First Southern or
CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by others, or
(z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

(iii) " _Restricted Territory_ " shall mean Palm Beach, Broward, Orange, Saint
Johns, Osceola, Seminole, Volusia and Duval Counties in Florida.

(d) Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

2\. _Term; Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (i) termination of the Merger
Agreement or (ii) two (2) years following the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Section 1 shall only become
operative upon the consummation of the Merger but, in such event, shall
survive the consummation of the Merger until two (2) years after the Effective
Time. Upon termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



D-3 3\. _Notices_. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication
given to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been given to such party (x) when delivered
personally to such party or (y) provided that a written acknowledgment of
receipt is obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or
registered mail or two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days
advance notice given in accordance with this Section 3) or (z) in the case of
CenterState only, on the first business day after it is sent by facsimile to
the facsimile number set forth below (or to such other facsimile number as
shall have specified by ten (10) days advance notice given in accordance with
this Section 3), with a confirmatory copy sent by certified or registered mail
or by overnight courier in accordance with this Section 3\.
