event that Director is required by law or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, Director will: (i)&nbsp;if and to the extent permitted by such law or court order provide CenterState with prompt notice of such requirement prior to the
disclosure so that CenterState may waive the requirements of this Agreement or seek an appropriate protective order at CenterState&#146;s sole expense; and (ii)&nbsp;use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential
