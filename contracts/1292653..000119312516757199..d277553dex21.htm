or waiver of all the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ for the Closing as
of the date determined pursuant to this proviso) or (b) at such other place

").

Section 1.6 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the
" _Surviving Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided in and by the

2.3(b)_ ) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash, without any interest thereon and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 2.2(f)_.

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ shall be cancelled
automatically and shall cease to exist, and the holders of (A) certificates
which immediately before the Effective Time represented such shares (the "

(d) _Equitable Adjustment_ (i). If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, and subject to the terms and

any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of

outstanding shares of capital stock.

 

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Effective
Time, the Company and Parent shall (i) jointly select a bank or trust company
that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company to act as the paying

satisfactory to Parent and the Company. Parent shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Common Stock, cash or immediately available funds in an amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. Such
funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."
For the avoidance of doubt, Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_ with respect to Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be
payable solely pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ and not pursuant to this _Section
2.2_.

 



4 (c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common Stock
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holders shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and (B)
instructions for surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-
Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
instructions provided by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_
above, together with a duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and
any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
that Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive, and the
Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the number of shares formerly evidenced by that Certificate or
Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
be cancelled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so
long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents
required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer taxes or (2)
establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that
any such transfer taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section
2.2(c)_ , each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay
any dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share and the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by it.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such affidavit, the
Merger Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate. 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time.

 



5 (f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or
withholding was made for all purposes under this Agreement.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
Affiliates) shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for any amount properly paid to a Governmental Authority under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion and reasonably acceptable
to the Company, or in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any such
investment shall be for the benefit, and at the risk, of Parent, and any
interest or other income resulting from such investment shall be for the
benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to former stockholders of the
Company, and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the former stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such
losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this _Article II_.

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to Parent
for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this _Article II_ , subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties,
at the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding option granted to purchase shares
of Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then
exercisable or vested) shall automatically, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such Company
Option, become fully vested and converted into the right to receive, after the
Effective Time in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ , a cash payment with
respect thereto equal to the product of

 



6  (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of such Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ ", and the sum of all such
payments, the " _Total Option Cash Payments_ ") and (ii) all Company Options
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Cash Payment. If the exercise price of a Company Option is equal to or

terminated at the Effective Time without payment or consideration therefor and
the holder of such Company Option shall cease to have any rights whatsoever
with respect thereto.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, at the Effective Time, (i) each award of restricted stock granted

virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub or the
holder of such Company Restricted Stock Award, become fully vested and
converted into the right to receive, after the Effective Time in accordance
with _Section 2.3(d)_ , a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the
product of (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock Award Payment_ " and
the sum of all such payments, the " _Total Restricted Stock Award Payments_
") and (ii) all Company Restricted Stock Awards shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted
Stock Award Payment.

Effective Time, (i) each award of performance share units granted (each, a "
_Company PSU_ ") that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action by Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such Company PSU, become
fully vested and converted into the right to receive, after the Effective Time
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ , a cash payment with respect thereto
equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(calculating such number of shares based upon Total Shareholder Return through
and including the Closing, including payments of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and with such shares being prorated for the number of days from
the commencement of the Performance Period (as defined in the applicable grant
agreement) through and including the Closing Date compared to the total
number of days in the Performance Period) and (B) the Merger Consideration
(the " _PSU Payment_ " and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total PSU
Payments_ ") and (ii) all Company PSUs shall automatically cease to exist,
and each holder of a Company PSU shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the PSU Payment.

regularly scheduled payroll cycle after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) mail a
check or otherwise make payment using the Companys existing payroll system to
(i) each holder of a Company Option, in the amount of the aggregate Option
Cash Payment due and payable to such holder pursuant to

 



7   _Section 2.3(a)_ , (ii) each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award, in
the amount of the aggregate Restricted Stock Award Payment due and payable to
such holder pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ and (iii) each holder of a Company
PSU, in the amount of the aggregate PSU Payment due and payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ , in each case subject to any applicable
deduction or withholding under _Section 2.2(f)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall
ensure that the Surviving Corporation has an amount in cash sufficient to pay
all amounts required by this _Section 2.3(d)_.

 

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_ , _Section 2.3(b)_ and _Section 2.3(c)_.

with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have been authorized by
the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, if any, as
set forth in _Section 2.3(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such payments
shall be made to the holders of such Company Restricted Stock Awards or
Company PSUs simultaneously with the Total Restricted Stock Award Payments and
Total PSU Payments. 

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Common Stock for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in
favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the
appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects
with, the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.4(a)_ , if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively waives, withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights, entry into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise), then such holders shares (i) shall
be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if
they had been converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share formerly representing such shares in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, the withdrawals of such demands and
any other related instrument served on the Company under the DGCL, in each
case, within two (2) Business Days of receipt thereof, and (ii) the right to
participate in, and at Parents election and expense, direct and control all

Company shall not (or cause or permit any Person on its behalf to) offer to
make or make any payment or settle, compromise, or offer to settle or
compromise, or otherwise negotiate with respect to any such demands for
appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

any forms, reports, schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC. The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all material
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring between January 1, 2014 and the
date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC staff with respect to any
Company SEC Report. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, no Company SEC Report is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding SEC comment or investigation. 

Section 3.10 _Disclosure Documents_. The Company Proxy Statement and any other
filings made by, or required to be made by, the Company with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, and
together with the Company Proxy Statement, and any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the " _Transaction Filings_ "), when filed, distributed
or disseminated, as applicable, (i) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and (ii) will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
are made, not misleading, except that the Company makes no representation with
respect to information supplied by the Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion in the Transaction Filings.

Section 3.11 _Financial Statements; Disclosure Controls; Internal Controls_.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter:

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
included in the Company SEC Reports: (i) complied in all material respects
with applicable 

 



13  accounting requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated in the notes to those financial statements); and (iii) presented
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of notes).

 

(b) Since January 1, 2014, the Company has had in place and maintained
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably effective to ensure that all information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes to the SEC under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow such management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(c) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Based on the most recent evaluation of its principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer prior to the date of
this Agreement, (i) the Company had no "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board) in the design or operation of its internal controls over
financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) the Company does not have Knowledge
of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information in any
material respect and (B) to the Knowledge of the Company, any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
or that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information in any material respect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has made any prohibited loan or "extension of credit"
(within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to any director
or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



14 Section 3.12 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.12_

any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, inchoate or otherwise

that are required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, other than:

(a) Liabilities reflected or reserved against in the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016
(the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") or the footnotes thereto set forth in the
Company SEC Reports;

 

(b) Liabilities incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice;

 

(c) Liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Companys review of strategic alternatives or as
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement; and

(d) Liabilities that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

Section 3.13 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as otherwise expressly
contemplated or required by this Agreement, or as set forth in _Section 3.13_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, since the Balance Sheet Date to the date of
this Agreement, (a) the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, except in connection with the Companys review
of strategic alternatives and (b) there has not been any change, event,
development, state of facts, condition, occurrence or effect that has had or
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, except as set forth on _Section 3.13_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no action has been taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries between the Balance Sheet Date and the date of this Agreement
that, if taken between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
without the consent of Parent, would constitute a breach of _Sections
5.1(b)(ix)_ , _(x)_ , _(xv)_ or _(xviii)_.

 

Section 3.14 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.14_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter and with respect to Shareholder Litigation filed on
or after the date of this Agreement, (a) there are no legal actions, claims,
demands, arbitrations, hearings, charges, complaints, sanctions
investigations, examinations, indictments, litigations, suits or other civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative proceedings by or before a
Governmental Authority (collectively, " _Legal Actions_ ") pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that (i) have resulted in or, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or otherwise materially impair the

materially delay or impede the performance by the Company of its obligations
under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (b) there are no Orders outstanding against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that have resulted in or, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent to the Company before the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), it being agreed that disclosure of any

and warrant to the Company that:

Section 4.1 _Organization and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Law of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and

and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.3_ are true and correct,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger

other than:

Authority, as set forth on  _Section 3.3(f)_ of the Company Disclosure

(f) such other Governmental Authorization, where the failure to obtain
such Governmental Authorizations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



29 Section 4.3 _Authorization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary
power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub at a
meeting duly called and held has (a) unanimously approved and declared
advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) declared that it is in the best interests of the
stockholders of Parent or Merger Sub that Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and
by general equitable principles). Except to the extent obtained prior to
the date of this Agreement, no vote or consent of the stockholders of Parent
is required by any applicable Law or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent in connection
with the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and

not:

 

(a) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub;

(b) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
Law or Permit applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Parent Assets_ ") are bound,
assuming that all Governmental Authorizations described in _Section 4.2_ have
been obtained or made, as applicable, other than as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect;

(c) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration or consent) under any Contracts to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Parent
Assets are bound (collectively, " _Parent Contracts_ "), other than as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; or

 



30 (d) require any consent, approval or other authorization of, or filing with or
notification to, any Person under any Parent Contracts, other than as, if not
obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.5 _Capitalization; Interim Operations of Merger Sub; Ownership of
Common Stock;_ _Section_ _ _ _203_ _of the DGCL_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of one thousand
(1,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which
shares are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent. Merger Sub has no outstanding option, warrant, right or any other
agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any
capital stock of or other equity interests in Merger Sub.

 

(b) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will not have engaged in any business activities
or conducted any operations and have no Liabilities or obligations other than
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) No shares of Common Stock or securities that are convertible, exchangeable
or exercisable into Common Stock are owned (directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record) by any Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary or controlled Affiliate of any Sponsor,
Parent or Merger Sub. Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries. None of the Sponsors,
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective controlled Affiliates holds any rights
to acquire or vote any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to this
Agreement. Before the action of the Company Board taken on the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other
Person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, or has taken any action that would
cause the restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders
set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Sponsors, Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective Affiliates has any agreement, arrangement or
understanding concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
any director of the Company.

Section 4.6  _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement (including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub
of the Required Payments) that Parent or Merger Sub obtains Debt Financing
(including, without limitation, as contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
for or related to any of the transactions contemplated herein, but
acknowledging that the Companys right to specific performance to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter are subject
to the conditions set forth in _Section 8.16(b)_ ). Any failure to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Required Payments) as a result of a failure to
close any Debt Financing or receive the proceeds of any Debt Financing shall
constitute a material breach by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement.

 



31 (b) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company a duly executed equity commitment letter to which
the Company is an express third party beneficiary on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein, dated as of the date hereof (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes to such letter, the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ "), from GTCR Fund X/A LP, GTCR X/C LP and GTCR Co-Invest X LP
(collectively, the " _Sponsors_ " and each, a " _Sponsor_ "), pursuant to
which the Sponsors have committed, on the terms set forth therein and subject
to the conditions contained therein, to provide to Parent equity financing, in
the amounts set forth therein, in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Equity Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter has not been amended,
modified, terminated or withdrawn and is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and the Sponsors, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the Sponsors in accordance with its terms. There are no other agreements, side
letters or arrangements relating to the Equity Commitment Letter that would
reasonably be expected to affect the timing of the Closing or the availability
of the funding in full of the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter at the Closing.

 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, and no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure by Parent or
Merger Sub to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the
date hereof, there is no fact or occurrence existing that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (A) make any of
the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (B) result in any of the
conditions in the Equity Commitment Letter not being satisfied, (C) cause the
Equity Commitment Letter to be ineffective or (D) otherwise result in the
Equity Financing not being available at the Closing in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Sponsor has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or not to provide the
Equity Financing. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of Company and its Subsidiaries in _Section 3.6_ on the Closing Date, the net
proceeds from the Equity Financing and Debt Financing together with cash on
hand at the Company will be sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the
Required Payments. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all
commitment or other fees required by the Equity Commitment Letter that are
due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such
commitments and fees as they become due to the extent such payment is a
condition precedent to the availability of the Equity Financing. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Equity Financing or the conditions precedent thereto, other
than as explicitly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter (the " _Disclosed
Equity Conditions_ "). No Person has any right to impose, and none of the
Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept, any condition
precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Equity Conditions nor any
reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Equity Commitment
Letter on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition

 



32  which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under
the Equity Commitment Letter on the Closing Date). As of the date of this
Agreement, and assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full
amount of the Equity Financing, or that the Equity Financing will not be
available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

(d) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent
has delivered to the Company (i) a duly executed debt commitment letter, dated
as of the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes to such
letter and as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time
to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.20(c)_
, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from the lenders party thereto, including
any lenders who become party thereto by joinder (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to provide the debt amounts set forth therein (the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, together with
any permitted Alternative Debt Financing, is collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) the fee letter referred to in
the Debt Commitment Letter (with only fee amounts, pricing caps, original
issue discount, market flex and other customary economic terms redacted (none
of which would adversely affect the amount (other than through the operation
of the original issue discount) or availability of the Debt Financing)) (as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after
the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.20(c)_ , the " _Fee
Letter_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has
not been amended, modified, terminated or withdrawn and is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights, and by general equitable principles). There are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing that
would reasonably be expected to affect the timing of the Closing or the
availability of the funding in full of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter at the Closing.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in each of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter with respect to Parent and Merger Sub and, to
the Knowledge of Parent with respect to the Financing Sources, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy
any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof, to the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or occurrence existing that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to (A)
result in any of the conditions in each of the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter not being satisfied, (B) cause the Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter
to be ineffective, (C) cause any of the Lenders not to perform their
respective obligations to fund the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letter or (D) otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being available on a
timely basis in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, no Lender has notified Parent or
Merger Sub of its intention to terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or not to
provide the Debt Financing. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all
commitment or other fees

 



33  required by the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter that are due as of the
date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and
fees as they become due to the extent such payment is a condition precedent
to the availability of the Debt Financing. There are no conditions precedent
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as
explicitly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and unredacted portions of
the Fee Letter (the " _Disclosed Debt Conditions_ "). No Person has any right
to impose, and none of Parent or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept, any
condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed Debt Conditions
nor any reduction to the aggregate gross amount under the Debt Commitment
Letter on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would have the
effect of reducing the aggregate gross amount under the Debt Commitment Letter
on the Closing Date). As of the date of this Agreement, and assuming
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ ,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount
of the Debt Financing, or that the Debt Financing will not be available to
Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date.

 

Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming that the representations and warranties of
the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 3.6_ , _Section 3.11_
and _Section 3.12_ (in each case disregarding references to Company Material
Adverse Effect and other materiality qualifiers contained therein) are true
and correct in all material respects, on and as of the Effective Time, and
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal
Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or
any of its Affiliates before any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is subject to any Order of, or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, continuing investigation by, any Governmental
Authority, or any Order of any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.9 _FCC Consents_. Assuming that the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in _Section 3.3(f)_ are true and correct, Parent
represents that it does not have direct or indirect foreign ownership
interests that are required to be reported in the applications for the FCC
Consents.

Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. As of the date of this
Agreement (and, as of the Closing, except with the express consent of the
Company or as otherwise arise out of such discussions as may be approved by
the Company Board or a duly authorized committee thereof), none of the
Sponsors, Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective
controlled Affiliates has entered into any employment, management,
contribution, rollover or similar agreement or understanding, whether formal
or informal, or made or entered into any other Contract relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
with any of the Companys directors, officers or employees.

 



34 Section 4.11 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, adviser or investment banker is
entitled to any brokerage, success, finders or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.12 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Sponsors have delivered to the Company the duly executed
Limited Guaranty. As of the date hereof, the Limited Guaranty is in full force
and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Sponsors,
enforceable against the Sponsors in accordance with its terms, in each case,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and by
general equitable principles, and no event has occurred which, with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the Sponsors under
the Limited Guaranty.

 

Section 4.13 _No Additional Representations_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
a sophisticated purchaser, possesses such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment under this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement
and each of the other documents and instruments relating to the
Merger referred to herein, Parent and Merger Sub have each relied solely upon
its own investigation and analysis, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree (a) that, except for the specific representations and warranties of the
Company contained in _Article III_ , if applicable (which to the extent
provided for in this Agreement include and are subject to the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Reports), none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and their respective stockholders, controlling
persons, Representatives or any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and their business,
operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition, prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational metrics,
or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any
financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the Company,
supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any
of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives and (b) that, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, stockholders, Representatives or any other Person
shall have any Liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent or Merger
Sub, their Affiliates or their Subsidiaries, stockholders, Representatives or
any other Person on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided
or made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to
Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, stockholders, Representatives or any other Person, except as and
only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub, its Affiliates and its Representatives have received and may
continue to receive from the Company, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives certain projections, 

 



35  estimates and other forward-looking information for the business of the
Company and its Affiliates and certain plan and budget information. Parent and
Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets so furnished to them, their affiliates or their respective
Representatives (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets) and acknowledge and
agree that each of Parent and Merger Sub is not relying on any estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans or budgets made available or otherwise furnished
by the Company, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, and each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its
Representatives not to, hold any such Person liable with respect thereto
(whether in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict
liability) or otherwise). There are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make projections, estimates or other forward-looking information, and Parent
is familiar with such uncertainties.

violation of any Contract with respect to confidentiality or non-disclosure
owing to a third party (including any Governmental Authority) to which the

any applicable Law, (D) disclosure of any information that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets or
other confidential business information, (E) to the extent such information
relates to individual performance or personnel evaluation records,
medical histories or other personnel information, subjecting the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to potential liability or (F) resulting in a waiver of
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in such violation, disclosure or loss of privilege.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 13, 2016 (the

respect to the information disclosed under this _Section 5.3_ ; _provided_ ,
that the form of the Confidentiality Agreement and all obligations thereunder
shall automatically be extended for so long as this Agreement remains in
effect.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or

indirectly, rights to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time, the Company

complete control and supervision over the operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

 



40 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any access to the properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries granted pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall be
subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and reasonable insurance
requirements.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than those contacts made in the
ordinary course of business not concerning the Company, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the express prior written consent of
the Company (which, prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act, shall be in the Companys sole discretion
and thereafter shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective Affiliates, directly
or indirectly, contact any Person it knows to be an agent, supplier, customer
or vendor of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding, or in connection
with, the Company, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise in violation of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(g) No investigation or information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.2_
shall affect any representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement

Section 5.4 _Go-Shop; No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
(including for the avoidance of doubt _Section 5.4(b)_ ), during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the Solicitation
Period End-Date, the Company and its Representatives shall have the right,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate and knowingly facilitate
or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or
providing access to the businesses, properties, books, records or personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to (but only pursuant
to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that could constitute, an
Alternative Proposal; provided, that the Company shall promptly provide or
make available to Parent any written material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to any Person and that was not previously provided or made available
to Parent; and (ii) continue, enter into and maintain discussions
or negotiations with respect to Alternative Proposals or other proposals that
could lead to Alternative Proposals, or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or facilitate any such discussions or negotiations. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Solicitation Period End-Date" means 11:59 p.m.
(Chicago time) on December 2, 2016.

(b) From and after the Solicitation Period End-Date, except with respect to
Excluded Parties, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
instruct its and their respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Third
Person that may be ongoing with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and (B)
request within two (2) Business Days of the Solicitation Period End-Date that
each such Third Person promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. From the Solicitation
Period End-Date until the earlier of termination of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except as expressly
permitted by _Section 5.4(e)_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and instruct its and their respective Representatives not
to, (i) solicit,

 



41  initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information or providing access to the businesses,
properties, books, records or personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or the Company reasonably expects to lead to, an Alternative
Proposal, (ii) have any discussions (other than to state that the Company is
not permitted to have discussions) or participate in any negotiations
regarding an Alternative Proposal or any inquiry or offer that the Company
reasonably expects to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii) execute or enter
into any Contract with respect to an Alternative Proposal, or approve or
recommend an Alternative Proposal or any agreement, understanding or
arrangement relating to an Alternative Proposal, (iv) take any action to make
the provisions of any takeover statute inapplicable to any transaction
contemplated by an Alternative Proposal, or (v) publicly do or propose to do
any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may continue
to take any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, from and
after the Solicitation Period End-Date until the earliest of (A) the date on
which the Excluded Party has terminated or withdrawn the Alternative Proposal
made prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, any amended or modified Alternative Proposal submitted by
such Excluded Party shall not be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an
expiration, termination or withdrawal of such previously submitted Alternative
Proposal) and (B) 11:59 p.m. (Chicago time) on December 13, 2016 (unless such
discussions or negotiations are permitted to continue under _Section 5.4(c)_
), with respect to any Person, group of Persons or group that includes any
Person (so long as such Person and the other members of such group, if any,
who were members of such group immediately prior to the Solicitation Period
End-Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing of such group at all
times following the Solicitation Period End-Date and prior to the termination
of this Agreement) that made a bona fide Alternative Proposal before the
Solicitation Period End-Date and with whom the Company is having ongoing
discussions or negotiations as of the Solicitation Period End-Date regarding
such bona fide Alternative Proposal (or any amendment or modifications
thereto), in each case, that the Company Board determines, prior to the
Solicitation Period End-Date, in consultation with its legal and financial
advisors, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal (all such Persons, together with their Affiliates, equityholders and
co-investors, " _Excluded Parties_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(b)_ , but without limiting the actions
permitted by _Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_  (including the right to
maintain discussions and negotiations with Excluded Parties), following the
receipt by the Company of a bona fide written Alternative Proposal after the
Solicitation Period End-Date that was not solicited in violation of this 
_Section 5.4_ (other than an unintentional and immaterial violation) and prior
to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained if (A) the Company Board
determines, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, based on
the information then available and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that failing to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may,
in response to such Alternative Proposal, subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.4_ , (i) furnish access and information with respect to the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Third Person who has made such
Alternative Proposal pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements (provided that all such written material non-public information
has previously been provided or made available to Parent or is provided or
made available to Parent promptly after it is provided or made available to
such Third Person)

 



42  and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such
Alternative Proposal. From and after the Solicitation Period End-Date (and
including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Alternative
Proposal received prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date, the foregoing
information with respect to such Alternative Proposal and whether the Company
Board has designated the Third Person making such Alternative Proposal as
an Excluded Party), the Company shall advise Parent of the receipt of any
Alternative Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal (in each case within two (2)
Business Days of receipt thereof) and specify the material terms and
conditions thereof, including the identity of the Third Person making such
Alternative Proposal and an unredacted copy of the Alternative Proposal
submitted by such Third Person (including any materials relating to such
Third Persons proposed financing sources, if any). The Company shall notify
Parent within two (2) Business Days of any material modifications to the
financial or other material terms of such Alternative Proposal or inquiry.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.4_ , the Company Board shall not,
directly or indirectly, (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly or resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or (ii) approve,
authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any
Alternative Proposal (each of (i) and (ii), a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) approve, authorize, endorse, recommend or
allow, or propose publicly to approve, authorize, endorse, recommend or allow
the Company to enter into a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
other Contract relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement). 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(d)_ , the Company Board may, before obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote, in response to a bona fide written Alternative
Proposal received by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement but
before the Requisite Company Vote and determined by the Company Board in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, to be a Superior
Proposal, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and if the Company
Board so chooses, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ to
enter into a definitive written Contract with respect to such Superior
Proposal), but only if:

(i) such Superior Proposal, or Alternative Proposal that was a predecessor
thereto, did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach (other than an
unintentional and immaterial breach) by the Company of this _Section 5.4_ and
the Company shall have otherwise complied in all material respects with
all of its obligations under this _Section 5.4_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal;

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent
that it is prepared to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive written Contract with
respect to a Superior Proposal, as applicable, which notice shall include (A)
the identity of the Third Person making such Superior Proposal, (B) the terms
and conditions of the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and
(C) an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal (including any materials
relating to such Third Persons proposed financing sources, if any);

 



43 (iii) after providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
during the three (3) Business Day period after delivery of the notice
contemplated by clause (ii) above (it being understood that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) and a
new period of negotiation under this clause (iii) of two (2) instead of three
(3) Business Days), to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Limited Guaranty as would permit the Company Board to determine that the
Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal;

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and
the Limited Guaranty that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than
5:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the last day of such three (3) Business Day or two
(2) Business Day period, as applicable, and referred to (without duplication)
in clause (iii) above, in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be
given effect; and

(v) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
the conclusion of the negotiations provided for in clause (iii) above and
consideration of any changes to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty offered by Parent
pursuant to clause (iv) above, without duplication, and consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive written Contract with respect to a Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if, following the occurrence of
an Intervening Event, the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that, in
light of such Intervening Event, its failure to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event, but only if:

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with all of
its obligations under this _Section 5.4(f)_ with respect to such Intervening
Event;

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least three (3) Business Days in advance, of its determination to effect such
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances constituting
such Intervening Event; provided that in the event of any material changes to
the facts and circumstances constituting such Intervening Event, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.4(f)_ with respect to such new
written notice and a new period of two (2) instead of three (3) Business Days;

 



44 (iii) after providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
during such three (3) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, and
referred to (without duplication) in clauses (ii) and (iv), to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guaranty as would permit
the Company Board to determine that the Intervening Event would not continue
to constitute an Intervening Event;

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Limited Guaranty that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00
p.m. (Chicago time) on the last day of such three (3) or two (2) Business Day
period, as applicable, and referred to (without duplication) in clauses (ii)
and (iii), in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company, and shall have determined that the Intervening Event would continue
to constitute an Intervening Event if such changes were to be given effect;
and

(v) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after the
conclusion of the negotiations provided for in clause (iii) above,
consideration of any changes to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty offered by Parent
pursuant to clause (iv) above, without duplication, and consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that failure to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or making any other disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or such
disclosure is otherwise required or advisable under applicable Law; provided,
further, that any disclosure of the type described in this sentence that does
not contain an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall
be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.4_ by its Subsidiaries or the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives, including, with respect to such
Representatives, a failure to comply with the instructions given to them
pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ , (in each case, other than unintentional
and immaterial breaches) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.4_ ) by the Company.

(i) The Company may waive or fail to enforce any standstill or similar
provision in any confidentiality or other agreement it has entered into with
any Person, whether prior to or after the date hereof, in order to permit non-
public Alternative Proposals to be made to the Company Board on or prior to
the Solicitation Period End-Date and otherwise only, if and to the extent, in
the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Days) following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and

Company Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none of the information

the end of any discussions with any Excluded Party as permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.4(b)_ (and without regard to any subsequent discussions permitted
pursuant to _Section 5.4(c)_ ). The Company shall promptly (A) notify
Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence (and reasonable summaries of all oral
comments or conversations) relating to the Company Proxy Statement between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff,
on the other hand. Before responding to any such comments or requests or the
filing or mailing of the Company Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of
the Company Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings (which
comments by Parent shall be reasonably considered in good faith by the
Company).

 

(d) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with this Agreement.

(e) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates is discovered
by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Company Proxy Statement so that such document would not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the context under which they are made, not
misleading, the party discovering this information shall, as promptly as
practical (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), notify the other
parties to this Agreement and, to the extent required by Law, Parent and the
Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
this information, as promptly as practicable, to be field with the SEC and,
to the extent required by Law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 5.6 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, all actions necessary to (a) establish a record date for, duly call
and give notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting (the record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the " _Record Date_ ") to consider and vote
upon (i) the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) a non-binding advisory vote
on "golden parachute" executive compensation arrangements if required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act; and (b) mail the Company Proxy Statement to

Proxy Statement); _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to mail
the Company Proxy Statement prior to the later of (i) the Solicitation Period

Company shall

 



47  call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable
(but in any event, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting prior to the later of (i) January 18, 2017 or (ii)
thirty-five (35) calendar days following the mailing of the definitive Company
Proxy Statement for the purpose of voting on adoption of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting: (i) with the prior written
consent of Parent; (ii) for the absence of a quorum (not to exceed thirty (30)
calendar days); and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time (not to exceed
thirty (30) calendar days) for the filing and distribution of any supplemental
or amended disclosure with respect to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary or advisable under
applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the
Company Stockholders Meeting has been convened, the Company shall, upon the
request of Parent unless the Company Board determines, following a Change in
Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event, that such adjournment
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and the
Company may, if Parent does not make such request, adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions to the extent necessary
to solicit additional proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement, for
such time period as determined by Parent (or, if Parent does not make such
request, as determined by the Company); _provided_ , _however_ that (x) such
adjournment shall not exceed ten (10) calendar days for each such
adjournment; (y) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned by
more than thirty (30) calendar days in the aggregate from the originally
scheduled date of the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (z) no such
adjournment shall be permitted if the Company shall have received by the
Company Stockholders Meeting an aggregate number of proxies voting for the
adoption of this Agreement, which have not been withdrawn, such that the
condition in  _Section 6.1(a)_ would be satisfied if a vote were taken at the
Company Stockholders Meetings. Once the Company has established the Record
Date, the Company shall not establish a different record date without the
prior written consent of Parent, including as a result of any adjournment of
the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to the prior sentence. Unless the
Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement. In the event the Company Board shall have effected
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the return of proxies regarding the adoption of this
Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Law. Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall
submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting
even if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or proposed or announced any intention to do so. The Company shall,
upon the reasonable request of Parent, use reasonable best efforts to advise
Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate
tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the adoption of this
Agreement.

 



48 Section 5.7 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. For a period of not less than one (1) year
following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and who continues in such
capacity following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i)
salary, hourly wage rate, short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or
commission opportunity and other compensation (excluding equity and equity-
based awards which will remain discretionary) that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate and (ii) benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) than those provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees of Parent or such Subsidiaries
from time to time.

(b) _Cash Bonuses_. Notwithstanding any permitted amendment, termination or
discretion applicable to any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the
payment of annual cash bonuses, Parent agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
pay bonuses to each Continuing Employee in respect of calendar year 2016 ("
_Cash Bonuses_ ") in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Benefit Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement at target. The Cash
Bonuses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation at the time or times that
such Cash Bonuses would normally be paid by the Company, but in no event later
than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Cash Bonus was
earned. Each Continuing Employee will be entitled to receive a prorated
portion of the target Cash Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee in the
event that such Continuing Employees employment is terminated without Cause
(as defined in _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) or such
Continuing Employee resigns for Good Reason (as defined in _Section 5.7(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter) prior to the date the Cash Bonuses are paid
(provided that the provisions of this sentence shall not result in the
duplication of bonus payments to such Continuing Employee), such prorated Cash
Bonus to be payable promptly following the date of such termination.

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, during the
Continuation Period, (i) honor any severance, change in control and similar
agreements, in each case, in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
provide severance to any Continuing Employee who shall be terminated without
cause during the Continuation Period in such amounts and on such terms and
conditions that are no less favorable than would have been provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or, if greater,
consistent with Parents severance program as applied to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time.

(d) If requested in writing by Parent to the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
adopt written resolutions of its board of directors to terminate, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the date on which the Company becomes
a member of the same "Controlled Group of Corporations" (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent, any Company Benefit Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code.

 



49 (e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the
Companys retention program providing for the payment of retention bonuses to
certain Continuing Employees in connection with the Merger for the purpose of
retaining the services of such Continuing Employees, on the terms set forth on
_Section 5.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Retention Program_
"). Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid the retention bonuses pursuant to the Retention
Program, to certain Continuing Employees in connection with the Merger for
the purpose of retaining the services of such Continuing Employees.

(f) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for such Continuing Employees
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective
Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for
which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service),
to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable
Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, where applicable, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) at the Effective Time,
each Continuing Employee immediately shall be eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such
waiting time was satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); (ii) subject
to any required approval of the applicable insurer, which Parent agrees to use
or cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best
efforts to obtain, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan to be waived
or satisfied for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as of the
Effective Time; and (iii) Parent shall cause all eligible expenses incurred by
each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(g) With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any
Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off
policy applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to, allow such Continuing Employee to use
such accrued paid time off in a manner and on such terms and conditions that
are consistent with Parents paid time off policy as applied to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time from and
after the Effective Time.

 

(h) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ , whether express or implied, shall (i)
constitute an establishment of, amendment to or other modification of any
Company Benefit Plan or New Plan, or (ii) confer upon any current or former
employee (or the dependents or beneficiaries thereof) of the Company, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their 

 



50  respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights or remedies of any nature
or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.7_ , including (A)
any right to employment or continued employment, (B) any particular term or
condition of employment for any specified period, or (C) any limitation on the
right of Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit
Plan or New Plan.

 

Section 5.8 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing
in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Benefit
Plans (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents, in the comparable organizational document of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, or in any Contract between an Indemnified Party
and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this
Agreement and, in the case of such Contracts, listed on _Section 5.8(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, to survive the Merger and to continue in full
force and effect (and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
a manner that would adversely affect any rights thereunder or hereunder or
any Indemnified Party) for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any
applicable agreement with an Indemnified Party in effect on the date of
this Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents (or in the comparable
organizational document of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) with respect to
all acts and omissions prior to the Effective Time arising out of or relating
to their service as directors, officers or employees of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as
a director, officer or employee of such other Person at the request of the
Company or Parent, or fiduciaries of the Company Benefit Plans, whether
asserted or claimed at or after or occurring before the Effective Time
(including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If
any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection
with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, advance as incurred any Damages out
of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parents or
the Surviving Corporations, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking in
customary form by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such
Damages if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law or the Company
Organizational Documents (or in the comparable organizational document of any
of the Companys Subsidiaries) that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Legal Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified
Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could reasonably
be expected to be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Legal Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing.

 



51 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous with respect to claims
arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to
pay in the aggregate an annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for such insurance before the date of
this Agreement (such 300% amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If Parent
or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in
the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Premium,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the
arrangements contemplated by this  _Section 5.8(c)_ , before the Effective
Time, the Company shall be entitled to (and, at Parents request, the Company
shall) purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy
covering the matters described in this _Section 5.8(c)_ for an amount not to
exceed the Maximum Premium and, if the Company purchases such a policy before
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligations under
this _Section 5.8(c)_  shall be satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by other Persons. Parent hereby agrees (i) that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the
Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such other Persons to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or
liabilities incurred by any such Indemnified Party are secondary), (ii) that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by any such Indemnified Party and shall be liable
for the full indemnifiable amounts, without regard to any rights any such
Indemnified Party may have against any such other Person and (iii) that Parent
irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases (and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to irrevocably waive, relinquish and release) such other Persons
from any and all claims against any such other Persons for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Each of
Parent and Surviving Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment
by any of such other Persons on behalf of any such Indemnified Party with
respect to any claim for which such Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification from the Surviving Corporation shall affect the foregoing and

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person

or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, appropriate or advisable to cause the conditions set forth in

by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable. The terms of this

consents, approvals or other authorizations or waivers from, and make any

Person reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including under any Contract to which Parent

requested by Parent) is a party or by which their respective properties or
assets may be bound, (ii) make any other submissions either required or

regulations of NASDAQ and any other applicable Law, (iii) take or cause to be
taken all other actions necessary, appropriate or advisable consistent with

periods, (B) remove, mitigate or limit any material conditions that may be

required consents, approvals or authorizations, including the FCC Consents and
State PUC Consents, as applicable,

 



53  under Communications Laws as soon as practicable, (iv) defend any Legal
Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, until the
entry of a judgment on the merits in such Legal Action by a court or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (whether such judgment is
appealable or not) and (v) execute and deliver any additional documents or
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings and
notifications. Neither Parent nor the Company shall extend any statutory
deadline or waiting period or consent to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event no later than (i) ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file any Notification and
Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice,

appropriate notifications, registrations, applications and other filings to or
with the FCC, foreign regulatory authorities or State PUCs, including those
requesting the FCC Consents and State PUC Consents). Parent shall pay the
applicable FCC, HSR and State PUC filing fees with respect to all such
notices, filings, and applications seeking all applicable FCC Consents and
State PUC Consents. In the event that any petition for reconsideration or
appeal is filed, the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to oppose or contest any such petition
or appeal. In the event that the FCC or any State PUC seeks to impose
material conditions on the approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to oppose, mitigate or limit any such material
condition. In the event that the FCC or any State PUC issues a decision
rescinding any Permit, the parties will cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to seek reconsideration and to appeal such decision.
In the event that, notwithstanding the cooperation and reasonable best efforts
of the Company and the Parent, the FCC or any State PUC rescinds any Permit by
a final order as to which no further reconsideration or appeal is available,
the Company and the Parent agree to cooperate to comply with such final order
with the plan of action for that compliance to be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Parent.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and subject to any restrictions
under any Law, shall cause its HSR Affiliates to, promptly inform the other
party upon receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or
the Company (or any of their respective HSR Affiliates) receives a request
for information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor

 



54  in good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. Prior to delivery of such response, to the extent practicable, such
party shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such response. No party shall participate in any substantive
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or
conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly
of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which
Parent proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law as promptly as practicable.

(d) All obligations under this _Section 5.10_ applicable to Parent shall also
apply to Parents HSR Affiliates,  _mutatis mutandis_ , and Parent shall
cause its HSR Affiliates to comply with such obligations.

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
to the extent required by applicable Law or rules of NASDAQ, in which case
that party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no partys consent shall be required, and no
party shall be required to consult with any other party in connection with,
or provide any other party an opportunity to review or comment upon, any press
release or other public statement or comment to be issued or made with respect
to any Alternative Proposal, Company Adverse Recommendation Change or with
respect to any actions contemplated by _Section 5.4(e)_ , _Section 5.4(f)_ or
_Section 5.4(g)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior consent of
the other parties, the Company may (a) communicate with customers,
vendors, suppliers, financial analysts, investors and media representatives
in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance with applicable
Law to the extent such communications are consistent with information included
in a press release or other document previously approved for external
distribution by Parent and (b) issue public statements or disseminate

by the party incurring those Expenses.

 



55 Section 5.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, the Company and their
respective boards of directors shall use reasonable best efforts (a) to ensure

16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.18 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence of any event known to it

in the case of the Company, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or, in the
case of Parent, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (B) cause any
condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be unsatisfied at any time prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ shall not be considered in determining whether
any such condition has been satisfied or (C) cause any authorization,
consent, Order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority or third
party necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to not be obtained by the Outside Date or (ii) any Legal Action
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or Parent, threatened which
questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement or the ability of any
party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.18_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the party giving
such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely by virtue
of having given such notice.

 



56 (b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide to Parent copies of all
material written notices received from any Governmental Authority by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such material written notice

Section 5.19 _Certain Litigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall control and defend all stockholder litigation against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the directors or officers of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, arising out of, in connection
with, or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (collectively, the " _Shareholder Litigation_ "); 
_provided_ , that Parent shall, at its expense, have the right to participate
in such proceedings. For purposes of this _Section 5.19_ , "participate" means
that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Shareholder Litigation by the Company (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to such Shareholder Litigation but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Shareholder
Litigation except for the settlement consent set forth in _Section 5.19(b)_.
The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify Parent in
writing of, and shall keep Parent updated about all material developments in,
any Shareholder Litigation.

 

(b) The Company shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent before
entering into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to
such Shareholder Litigation.

cooperate, in the defense of any Shareholder Litigation and shall furnish or
cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend, at
each partys own expense, such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 5.20 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Equity Financing at the Closing on the terms and conditions described in
the Equity Commitment Letter. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to
(a) comply with its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, (b)
maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms,
(c) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (including definitive
agreements related thereto), and (d) if all conditions applicable to Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter (including definitive
agreements related thereto) have been satisfied or waived, and the Debt
Financing has been or will be funded in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date if the Equity Financing is
funded on or prior to the Closing Date, consummate the Equity Financing on or
prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall not, without

 



57  the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive
any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter (including any Contracts related thereto) or any other
provision of, or remedies under, the Equity Commitment Letter (including any
Contracts related thereto) that would reasonably be expected to materially
impair or delay or prevent the funding of the Equity Financing. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall, directly or indirectly, make all proceeds of
the Equity Financing received by Parent available to Merger Sub as are
required for Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with their
terms, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Debt Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms
and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letter) or on such other terms acceptable to
Parent and the Financing Sources, so long as such other terms would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay or prevent the ability of
Parent to consummate the Merger or the Debt Financing and (iii) satisfy (or,
if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter that
are within its control. Parent shall not, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including
any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any
Alternative Debt Financing will not be deemed a voluntary replacement for
purposes of the sentence), the Debt Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification, or waiver or voluntary replacement (i) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing (giving effect to any flex provisions) as compared to those in the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
reduces the aggregate gross amount of the Debt Financing unless the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (iii) would otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt no consent from the
Company will be required for: (A) any amendment, replacement, supplement
or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter that is limited to adding
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement (including in replacement of a Lender), (B) implementation or
exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as
of the date hereof or (C) any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Agreements so
long as such action would not be prohibited by the foregoing clauses (i)-(iv).

 



58 (d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (1) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ ") on terms not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent (as
reasonably determined by Parent) than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter (taking into account any "flex" provisions) from the
same or other sources reasonably acceptable to Parent and which do not include
any incremental conditionality to the consummation of such Alternative Debt
Financing that are more onerous to Parent or the Company (in the aggregate)
than the Disclosed Debt Conditions and (2) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 5.20_ , (i) the term " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ " will be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letters remaining in effect at
the time in question), (ii) the term " _Fee Letter_ " will be deemed
to include any fee letter (or similar agreement) and engagement letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt financing arranged in
compliance with this _Section 5.20_ , and (iii) the term " _Lenders_ " will
be deemed to include any lenders providing the Alternative Debt Financing
arranged in compliance herewith. Parent shall, (A) keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis in respect of its efforts to consummate
the Debt Financing and (B) in addition to the delivery of the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter, provide the Company with copies of other material
Definitive Debt Agreements. Parent will provide the Company with prompt (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days of obtaining knowledge thereof)
written notice of any breach or default by any party to any Debt Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Debt Agreements of which Parent gains knowledge and
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Lender or other Financing Source with respect to any breach or default or,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Debt Agreements or any provision thereof. For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent will, directly or indirectly, make all proceeds of the Debt
Financing received by Parent available to Merger Sub as are required for
Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 5.21 _Financing_ _Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent, at Parents expense, such

connection with obtaining the Debt Financing no later than the Closing Date,
which reasonable best efforts shall include, but not be limited to:

outstanding Indebtedness (A) indicating the amount required to discharge such
Indebtedness at Closing and/or releasing the obligations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries thereunder, and (B) if such Indebtedness is secured by any
liens, agreeing to release such liens upon receipt of the payoff amount; and

60  or default under, any material written agreement, Contract, subcontract,
lease, license understanding, instrument, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,

82 Section 8.15 _Remedies_. Subject, in each case, to the terms of this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity. Subject, in each case, to
the terms of this Agreement, the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any
one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

Section 8.16 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VII_ , subject to clause (b) of this _Section 8.16_ , the parties to this
Agreement (i) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or other court of the United States as specified in _Section
8.5_ , this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, (ii)
hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection with the obtaining of any injunctive relief
or specific performance and (iii) will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. This right to
injunctive relief and specific performance is in addition to any other remedy
to which the parties to this Agreement are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of
the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedy in connection with enforcing Parents and Merger Subs obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter,
or consummate the Merger (but not the right of the Company to injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than
with respect to the Equity Financing or the consummation of the Merger) shall
be subject to the requirements that (i) all conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at Closing and which were, at the
time of termination, capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Debt Financing has
been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at or before the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at or before the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, then it
is prepared to consummate the Merger.

Section 8.17 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were
upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed
an original of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when, and
only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart signed by all
of the other parties hereto. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
.pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such
delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original

 



83  executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from
earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be
disregarded in determining the partys intent or the effectiveness of such
signature. At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto shall
re-execute the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all
other parties. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to
lack of authenticity.

 

Section 8.18 _Company Disclosure Letter_. The inclusion of information in the
Company Disclosure Letter will not be construed as or constitute an admission
or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or
other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor will it be
construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such information is
material to the Company. In addition, matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter (including the
listing of items on any Company Disclosure Letter although such items may not
necessarily be required to be included in such Company Disclosure Letter
because of the dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement). Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any
dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure
Letter is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person
will use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is intended to
imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and no Person
will use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or
matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company
Disclosure Letter is or is not in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.19 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against the
named parties. All Legal Actions and Damages (whether in contract, tort,
equity, law or granted by statute whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to (a) this Agreement or any of the
other agreements or documents contemplated hereby, (b) the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the documents
contemplated hereby (including any representation or warranty made in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the other
agreements or documents contemplated hereby), (c) any breach or violation of
this Agreement (including the failure of any representation and warranty to
be true or accurate) or any of the

 



84  other agreements or documents contemplated hereby and (d) any failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) or the
other agreements or documents contemplated hereby to be consummated, in the
case of clauses (a) through (d), may be made only against (and are those
solely of) the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter, the
Limited Guaranty and the Confidentiality Agreement, and then only to the
extent of the specific obligations of such Persons set forth in such document,
as applicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
each party hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that (except to the
extent named as a party to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Limited Guaranty or the
Confidentiality Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations of such parties set forth in such document, as applicable) no
recourse under this Agreement, any related document or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any related
document shall be had against any Non-Recourse Company Party or Non-Recourse
Parent Party, whether in contract, tort, equity, law or granted by statute
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil or otherwise.

Section 8.20  _Disclaimer_. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the
sole contractual benefit of such parties. Such representations and warranties
are made as of specific dates, only for purposes of the Agreement and for the
benefit of the parties hereto. Such representations and warranties are subject
to important exceptions and limitations agreed upon by the parties, including
being qualified by confidential disclosures, made for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between the parties rather than establishing these
matters as facts, and were made subject to a contractual standard of
materiality that may differ from the standard generally applicable
under federal securities laws or under other contracts. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 8.9_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. Any information concerning the subject matter of such
representations and warranties may have changed, and may continue to change,
since the date of the Agreement, and such subsequent information may or may
not be fully reflected in the Companys public reports. In some instances,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of contractual risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of such parties. Any
filing of this Agreement with the SEC or otherwise is only to provide
investors with information regarding its terms and conditions and not to
provide any other factual information regarding the Company or its business.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or any description thereof as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. The information in this Agreement should
be considered together with the Companys public reports filed with the SEC.

Section 8.21  _Waiver of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, none of the Financing Sources will have any liability to Company or
any of the Company Related Parties (defined below) relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company or any of Company
Related Parties will have any rights or claims against any of

 



85  the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder and the Company and each
Company Related Party hereby waives any rights or claims against any Financing
Sources relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
any related agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

INTELIQUENT, INC. 

(a Delaware corporation)

 

ARTICLE I.

The name of the corporation is Inteliquent, Inc. (the " _Corporation_ ").

ARTICLE II.

 

The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of Delaware is
160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, Delaware 19904, in the county of Kent.
The name of its registered agent at such address is National Registered
Agents, Inc.

ARTICLE III.

 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") as it now exists or may hereafter be
amended and supplemented.

 

ARTICLE IV.

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is
authorized to issue is one thousand (1,000) shares, all of which shall be
common stock with a par value of one tenth of one cent ($0.001).

 

ARTICLE V.

From time to time any of the provisions of this certificate of incorporation
may be amended, altered or repealed, and other provisions authorized by the
laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in
the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any
time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this certificate of
incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this _Article V_.

 

ARTICLE VI.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers, privileges and
discretionary authority granted or conferred by the DGCL or other statutes or
laws of the State of Delaware, the board of directors of the Corporation (the
" _Board of Directors_ ") is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or
repeal the bylaws of the Corporation, without any action on the part of the
stockholders, but the stockholders may make additional bylaws and may alter,
amend or repeal any bylaw whether adopted by them or otherwise. The
Corporation may in its bylaws confer powers upon its Board of Directors in
addition to the foregoing and in addition to the powers and authorities
expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors by applicable law.

ARTICLE VII.

 

Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the
Corporation shall so provide. ARTICLE VIII.

 

To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now exists or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader limitation of
liability to its directors than permitted prior thereto), no director of the
Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty owed to the
Corporation or its stockholders. Any repeal or modification of this _Article
VIII_ shall not in any way diminish any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation existing prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE IX.

 

(A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual
or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while
a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan or any trust associated therewith (an " _Indemnitee_ "), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or
officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than permitted prior thereto), against all expenses, liabilities and losses
(including attorneys fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, excise
taxes or penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended from time to time (" _ERISA_ "), penalties and amounts paid or to
be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in
connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in _Section B_ of
this _Article IX_ with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this  _Section A_ of
_Article IX_ shall be a contract right and shall include the obligation of the
Corporation to pay the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition (an " _advance of expenses_ "); provided,
however, that advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be made
only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an " _undertaking_
"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there
is no further right to appeal (a " _final adjudication_ ") that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
_Section A_ of _Article IX_ or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of
the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same or lesser scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

(B) _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification of a director
or officer of the Corporation or advance of expenses (including attorneys
fees, costs and charges) under _Section A_ of this _Article IX_ shall be made
promptly, and in any event within forty-five (45) days (or, in the case of
an advance of expenses, twenty (20) days, provided that the director or
officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by _Section A_ of this
_Article IX_ ), upon the written request of the director or officer. If a
determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ is required, and the Corporation
fails to respond within sixty (60) days to a written request for indemnity,
the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If the
Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or an advance of
expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request
is not made within forty-five (45) days (or, in the case of an advance of  expenses, twenty (20) days, provided that the director or officer has
delivered the undertaking contemplated by _Section A_ of this _Article IX_ ),
the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this _Article IX_
shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in
part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce
a claim for advancement of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant
to _Section A_ of this _Article IX_ , if any, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made
a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. The procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for
whom indemnification is provided pursuant to _Section A_ of this _Article IX_
shall be the same procedure set forth in this  _Section B_ of _Article IX_
for directors or officers, unless otherwise set forth in the action of the
Board of Directors providing indemnification for such employee or agent.

 

(C) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its
own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him
or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his
or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

(D) _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least fifty percent
(50%) of whose equity interests are owned by the Corporation (a "subsidiary"
for purposes of this  _Article IX_ ) shall be conclusively presumed to be
serving in such capacity at the request of the Corporation.

(E) _Reliance_. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision
become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer,
employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have
relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights
contained in this _Article IX_ in entering into or continuing such service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in
this _Article IX_ shall apply to claims made against an Indemnitee arising out
of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the
adoption hereof.

 

(F) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
advance of expenses conferred in this _Article IX_ shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or under any statute, bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

(G) _Merger or Consolidation_.. For the purposes of this _Article IX_ ,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
Corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such  constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall
stand in the same position under this _Article IX_ , with respect to the
resulting or surviving Corporation, as he or she would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

(H) _Savings Clause_. If this _Article IX_ or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to
indemnification under _Section A_ of this _Article IX_ as to all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related
disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such
person pursuant to this  _Article IX_ to the fullest extent permitted by any
applicable portion of this _Article IX_ that shall not have been invalidated
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
