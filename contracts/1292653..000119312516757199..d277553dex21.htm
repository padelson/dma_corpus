indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation.&nbsp;Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met
the applicable standard of conduct.&nbsp;The procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for whom indemnification is provided pursuant to <U>Section A</U> of this <U>Article IX</U> shall be the same procedure set forth in this

Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary,

judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this
