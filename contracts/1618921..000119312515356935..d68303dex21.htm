transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,
and their respective stockholders and (b) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in each case on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, unanimously resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders

hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly
owned direct subsidiary of Parent and (iii) the separate corporate existence
of the Company, with all of its properties, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set
forth in _Article II_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Company as the Surviving Corporation and all  claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger

forth in this Agreement and specified in the DGCL.

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington

been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or at such other
time, place and date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing,
the Company and Parent will cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware an executed certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") as provided in the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to

certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ") until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law, except that such bylaws shall be amended by Parent as of
the Effective Time to change the name of the Surviving Corporation as used
therein to "Rite Aid Corporation" and to contain such provisions as are

SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the

Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
their respective stockholders or any other Person:

Merger to maintain relative ownership percentages) (collectively, the "
_Subsidiary Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $9.00 per

automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each (1) certificate
(a " _Certificate_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such Company Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and
Dissenting Shares) or (2) non-certificated Company Share held in book-entry
form representing any such Company Shares (other than Cancelled Shares,
Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration upon surrender in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. All Company Shares that are owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (including
Company Shares held as treasury stock by the Company), and in each case not
held on behalf of third parties, immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), shall automatically cease to
be outstanding and be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchanged therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Shares of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation except for those shares which
shall remain outstanding pursuant to clause (iii) of _Section 2.1(a)_, if
any.

 



3 SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares, Performance Units and
RSUs_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each vested Option (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Option subject to accelerated vesting upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) with a per share exercise price
less than the Per Share Merger Consideration that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Cash-Out Option_ ") shall
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Cash-Out
Option to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Cash-Out Option __multiplied__ by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Cash-Out
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_. The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Cash-
Out Options the cash payments described in this _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ on or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each (A) unvested Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) vested Option with a per
share exercise price equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each option described in clauses (A) and (B), a " _Rollover Option_ ") shall
be converted into an option (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Rollover Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of Parent Shares equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time __multiplied__ by
(ii) the Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the
next lower whole number of shares after aggregating each individual holders
Option with the same exercise price. The exercise price per Parent Share
subject to any such Adjusted Option will be an amount (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time __divided__ by (B) the Conversion
Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in all cases, (1) the exercise price
of, and number of Parent Shares subject to, each Adjusted Option shall be
determined as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code and (2) with
respect to any Rollover Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies, the
exercise price, the number of Parent Shares purchasable pursuant to each
Adjusted Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of each Adjusted
Option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares and Performance Units_. At the Effective
Time, each Restricted Share and Performance Unit outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Rollover Stock Award_ ") shall be
converted into a restricted share award

 



4  or performance share unit, as applicable, relating to the number of Parent
Shares (each, an " _Adjusted Stock Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock relating to such Rollover Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of the Performance
Units for which the applicable performance period has not completed, the
target number of shares of Company Common Stock) __multiplied__ by (y) the
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the next lower
whole number of shares; _provided_ , _however_ , such rounding shall be
applied on an aggregate basis to each individual holder and not on an award-
by-award basis. Each Adjusted Stock Award shall be subject to the same terms,
conditions and restrictions as were applicable to the converted Rollover Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that with respect
to the Rollover Stock Awards that immediately prior to the Effective Time are
Performance Units, at the Effective Time, (i) with respect to a pro rata
portion of each Performance Unit award, determined on the Closing Date based
on the number of days elapsed in the applicable performance period and applied
to the target number of shares as contemplated by clause (x) of this _Section
2.2(b)_ (such portion of any Performance Unit award, the " _Fixed Portion_
"), the performance goals shall no longer apply and following the Effective
Time the related Adjusted Stock Award shall be subject to service-based
vesting only on the same schedule as was applicable to the
related Performance Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
the performance goals or conditions with respect to the remainder of each
Performance Unit award (i.e., the portion of a Performance Unit award that is
not the Fixed Portion) shall be adjusted in accordance with the methodology
set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the
related Adjusted Stock Awards, as a result, shall be subject to performance-
based vesting and service-based vesting on the same schedule as was
applicable to the related Performance Units immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) _Treatment of RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether vested or unvested,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such RSU to
receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the RSU _
_multiplied__ by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to
_Section 2.3(e)_. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of RSUs the cash
payments described in this _Section 2.2(c)_ in accordance with the time and
form of payment provisions applicable to each RSU.

(d)  _Corporate Actions_.

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _Section 2.2(a)_, _Section 2.2(b)_ and _Section 2.2(c)_. As
of the Effective Time, each holder of a Cash-Out Option or RSU shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash
payments described in _Section 2.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.2(c)_,
respectively. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Cash-Out
Options or RSUs.

 



5 (ii) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon exercise of the
Adjusted Options and the vesting of the Adjusted Stock Awards assumed in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on an
appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the Parent Shares
subject to such Adjusted Options and Adjusted Stock Awards, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Adjusted
Options or Adjusted Stock Awards remain outstanding.

SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Company Shares and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with a paying agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive payment of
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which the holders of Company
Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in
the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments in respect of Company Shares converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration under _Section 2.1(a)_ (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in trust for the
benefit of the holders of the Company Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_ , (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America or short-term obligations guaranteed by the United States of America.
Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, to the extent that there are losses with respect
to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below
the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all applicable times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments, and Parent (and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall in any event be liable
for payment thereof. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable in respect of Company Shares under _Section 2.1(a)_
shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose other than as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_.

 



6 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event more than four (4) Business Days following
the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise
provide in the case of Book-Entry Shares, to each holder of record of Company
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting
Shares): (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in
customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass (1) with respect to Book-
Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-
entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) and (2) with respect
to Certificates, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section
2.3(f)_ to the Paying Agent), such transmittal materials to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in  _Section 2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(ii)  _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) to the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, a cash
amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the product of (A)
the number of Company Shares previously represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section
2.3(f)_) __multiplied__ by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate of such holder so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates.

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section
2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (it
being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to
have surrendered such Company Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such
"agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.3(e)_) equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Shares previously
represented by such Book-Entry Shares  _ _multiplied__ by (B) the Per Share

 



7  Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_, each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
(together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_. The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Company Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto and the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Shares
for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or its designees. Any holder of Company Shares (other
than Cancelled Shares, or Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore
exchanged Company Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates) or acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section
2.3(b)_, and Parent shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of their claim for the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the

 



8  Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share
is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this _Article II_. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender of Certificates (or upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message," in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares,
Cash-Out Options or RSUs such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment (and, with respect to the RSUs,
the vesting of such RSUs) under U.S. federal tax Law or any other applicable
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be promptly remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental
Entity and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law, shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Shares, Cash-Out Options or RSUs in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
Parent, as the case may be.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate __multiplied__ by
(ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

SECTION 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof have properly
demanded appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not
effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, unless and until such Person
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal
under the DGCL, at which time such Company Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(a)_, without interest and after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ and such Company Shares shall
not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof shall cease to have
any other rights with respect to such Company Shares. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such consideration as may be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Company shall give Parent

 



9  prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company or any of its Representatives relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and Parent shall be entitled to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to
settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, except as required by applicable Law.

 

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments_. In the event that the number of Company Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Shares
issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
shall have been changed into a different number of Company Shares or
securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any subsidiary of the
Company or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except (i) other than with respect to  _Section 3.3(a)_ and the first
sentence and clause (i) of the second sentence of _Section 3.3(b)_, as
disclosed in the SEC Reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC on or after
March 1, 2014 and publicly available no less than one (1) Business Day prior
to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth therein
under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than factual information contained
therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other section
to the extent they are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature) or
(ii) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedules delivered to Parent by the Company concurrently with
entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on its face:

 

SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries (i) is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and, to the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and (ii) is qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept is
applicable, is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or present conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), in the case of subsidiaries of
the Company, where the failure to be so qualified or, to the extent such
concept is applicable, in good standing, or to have

 



10  such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Companys or its subsidiaries
direct or indirect ownership interest, as of the date of this Agreement, in
any Person not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company, other than
securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries and consisting of less than one percent (1%) of the
outstanding capital stock of such Person. All "significant subsidiaries" (as
such term is defined under Regulation S-X) and their respective jurisdictions
of organization are identified as such in the SEC Reports.

SECTION 3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent in the Data Room a correct and complete
copy of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended as
of the date hereof (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and the amended
and restated bylaws, as amended as of the date hereof (the " _Company Bylaws_
"), of the Company. The Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws
are in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The Company has made
available to Parent in the Data Room prior to the date of this Agreement
complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents, each as amended as of the date hereof, of
each of its "significant subsidiaries" (as such term is defined under
Regulation S-X), and each as so delivered is in full force and effect as of
the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of any provision of
its Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws in any respect material to
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

SECTION 3.3 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 1,500,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $1.00 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close
of business on October 23, 2015 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "):

 

(i) 1,046,237,000 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding,
other than Restricted Shares;

 

(ii) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding;

 

(iii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its
treasury;

 

(iv) there were (A) Options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price
of $2.703, entitling the holders thereof, upon exercise, to receive an
aggregate of up to 39,813,000 shares of Company Common Stock, (B) 5,195,000
Restricted Shares outstanding, (C) 4,647,000 Performance Units (assuming the
target number of Performance Units) outstanding and (D) 100,000 RSUs
outstanding, in each such case as granted or provided for under the Company
Stock Plans.

(b) From the close of business on the Capitalization Date through the date of
this Agreement, no Company Shares, Options, Restricted Shares, Performance
Units, RSUs or other rights to purchase or receive (or that are valued by
reference to) Company Shares have been granted or issued, except for Company
Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options,

 



11  the vesting of Restricted Shares, the vesting of Performance Units or the
vesting of RSUs, in each case that were outstanding on the Capitalization Date
and in accordance with their terms. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_,
as of the date of this Agreement, (i) there are not outstanding, authorized or
reserved for issuance any (A) shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company, (B) securities of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company,
(C) options, warrants, calls, phantom stock or other rights to acquire from
the Company, or obligations of the Company to issue or sell, any capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into, exercisable for, or
exchangeable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any capital stock or voting securities of the Company or (D) rights issued by
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company that are linked to, or based
upon, the value of shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company
(collectively, " _Company Securities_ "), and (ii) there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company Securities. All outstanding Company Shares, and all
Company Shares reserved for issuance as noted in _Section 3.3(a)_, when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, are or will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of pre-
emptive or similar rights. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of each of the Companys subsidiaries is (i) duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, to the extent such
concept is applicable, (ii) owned by the Company or another subsidiary of the
Company and (iii) owned free and clear of all Liens and limitations in voting
rights (other than (x) Permitted Liens described in clause (F) of the
definition thereof and (y) transfer and other restrictions under applicable
federal and state securities Laws). There are not outstanding or authorized
any (A) securities of any of the Companys subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of any such
subsidiary, (B) preemptive rights, options, warrants, calls, phantom stock,
conversion rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights or other rights to
acquire from the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries, or obligations
of the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries to issue or sell, any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into, exercisable
for, or exchangeable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any capital stock or voting securities of any such subsidiary or (C)
rights issued by the Company or a Company subsidiary that are linked to, or
based upon, the value of shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
the Companys subsidiaries. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter pursuant to
the terms thereof. No subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of Company
Common Stock.

(c) _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct
and complete list of Cash-Out Options, Rollover Options, Restricted Shares,
Performance Units and RSUs, including the holder, date of grant, vesting
schedule, number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by or subject to
the award (including, with respect to Performance Units, the target and
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the award), the
Company Stock Plan under which the award was granted and, where applicable,
exercise price and term. All grants of Options, Restricted Shares and
Performance Units and RSUs were validly issued and properly approved by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) in accordance with the applicable
Company Stock Plan and applicable Law, including the applicable requirements
of the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ").

 



12 SECTION 3.4 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority, and has taken all corporate action necessary, to execute and

(a) The Company has timely filed or otherwise furnished all material forms,
reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all
exhibits and other information incorporated therein, amendments and
supplements thereto) in each case required to be filed or furnished by it with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since March 3,
2012 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (all such forms, reports, statements,
certificates and other documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date,
including all exhibits and other information incorporated therein, amendments
and supplements thereto, collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of their
respective filing dates, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing
made prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment or superseding filing prior to the date of this Agreement, the SEC
Reports complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on
the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing with the SEC (or, if
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), none of the SEC Reports so filed contained, when filed, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent that the information in such
SEC Reports has been amended or superseded by a later SEC Report filed prior
to the date of this Agreement. Since the Applicable Date, the Company has been
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. None of the

all notes thereto) and its subsidiaries included in the SEC Reports have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries at
the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and their
consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows
and stockholders equity (deficit) for the periods indicated. The unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company (including any related notes
thereto) for all interim periods included in the SEC Reports have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP in all material respects applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the

normal and recurring period-end adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein or in the notes thereto).

 



15 (c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Such internal controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. Such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance in all material respects regarding the reliability of
the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys
financial statements for external purposes, in each case, in accordance with
GAAP. The Company has disclosed based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The terms "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" have the meanings assigned to such
terms in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.

Companys unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of August 29, 2015 or the
notes thereto included in the Companys SEC Reports, (ii) for liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since August 29, 2015
and (iii) for liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other than those which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

to the Company a true and complete copy of an executed commitment letter,
including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, in each case, as

conditionality of the debt financing contemplated by such Debt Commitment
Letter) from UBS AG, Stamford Branch (" _UBS Bank_ ") and UBS Securities LLC

Agreement and assuming that each of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ of this Agreement are satisfied at Closing, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that (i) any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied or (ii) except to the extent reduced prior to

The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall
terminate, waive, or amend to similar effect any existing standstill or
similar agreement to which it or one of its subsidiaries is a party, except
to the extent that prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board
determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



40 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from:

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar

or from making any other disclosure to stockholders if the Company Board
determines in good faith that the failure to make such disclosure would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law ( _provided_ that neither the Company nor the Company Board
may effect a Change of Recommendation unless expressly permitted by _Section
6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.3_, and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such

modifying the Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation); _provided_ , _further_ , that the issuance by the Company or
the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" communication as contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to its stockholders) in which the Company has not indicated that
the Company Board has changed the Recommendation shall not constitute a
Change of Recommendation;

(ii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
providing access to its properties, books and records and providing any
confidential or non-public information or data in response to a request
therefor by a Person or group who has made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof and was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or
facilitated in, and did not otherwise result from a, material violation of
this _Section 6.1_, if the Company Board (A) shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) has received from the Person
so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ that any such access, information or data has previously
been provided to Parent or its Representatives or is provided to Parent prior
to or substantially concurrently with the time such access, information or
data is provided to such Person or group;

(iii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,

Representatives who has made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof and was not initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in, and did
not otherwise result from a, material violation of this _Section 6.1_, if
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal; or

(iv) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a
Change of Recommendation (but only if permitted by _Section 6.1(c)_ or
_Section 6.3_).

time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, in response to a _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal that was made after the date hereof and was not initiated,
solicited, encouraged or facilitated in, and did not otherwise result from a,
material violation of this _Section 6.1_, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal taking into account any adjustment to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to such Acquisition Proposal and (B) the failure to take the action
in (i) and/or (ii) below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or the
Company Board may (and may resolve or agree to) (i) terminate this Agreement
under _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and enter into a definitive merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or similar written agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and/or (ii) effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with clause (x)(A) of _Section 6.3_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if the
Company terminates the Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the
Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee required to be paid under
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_ concurrently with or prior to such termination;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company will not be entitled to enter into
such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and terminate this Agreement or effect
a Change of Recommendation pursuant to clause (x)(A) of  _Section 6.3_
unless (x) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company
Notice_ "), advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to take such
action and containing the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies
of any written proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and (y) at
or after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately
following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the "
_Notice Period_ "), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and taking
into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent during the Notice Period) that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company
will, and will cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage
in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent
so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal. The Company agrees to notify Parent promptly if it determines during
such Notice Period not to terminate this Agreement and enter into
the Alternative Acquisition Agreement referred to in the Company Notice. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment to the terms
and conditions of a proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to a
Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new proposal or proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement relating to a Superior Proposal for purposes of this
_Section 6.1(c)_ requiring a new Company Notice and an additional Notice
Period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such additional Notice Period shall
expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivers such new Company
Notice (it being understood and agreed that in no event shall any such
additional two (2) Business Day Notice Period be deemed to shorten the initial
four (4) Business Day Notice Period).

 



42 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below: 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (including a tender
offer or exchange offer) from any Person or group of Persons (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) relating to (A) any merger, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination, purchase, or similar transaction with respect to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries whose business constitutes twenty percent (20%) or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets
(including equity securities of any subsidiary of the Company) or businesses
that constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated revenues,
net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(with all references to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal being deemed to reference "fifty percent (50%) or more")
that the Company Board in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger taking into account
all financing (including availability thereof) and regulatory aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal, the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof (as
compared to the transactions contemplated hereby), such other matters as the
Company Board deems relevant and any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 6.1(c)_.

 

SECTION 6.2 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a
preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it as required by the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by
the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all
SEC comments, if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement at the date that it (and any amendment
or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to the stockholders
of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, to comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations

 



43  promulgated thereunder and shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC and disseminate to the stockholders of the Company an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto, other
than in connection with a Change of Recommendation made in compliance with
this Agreement), or responding to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and consider
in good faith such comments proposed by Parent for inclusion therein.

SECTION 6.3 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), shall as promptly as practicable following
confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, take all action necessary, including under the DGCL, to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") and shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, postpone, recess or adjourn such
meeting; _provided_ that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn such
meeting (i) if on the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote or there are insufficient Company Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Stockholders Meeting; or (ii) if the failure to postpone,
recess or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be
a violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement to be timely provided to the holders of
Company Shares; _provided_ that the Stockholders Meeting shall not be
postponed, recessed or adjourned pursuant to this proviso to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting
was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent. The
Company shall (a) subject to _Section 6.1(c)_, include in the Proxy Statement
the Recommendation and (b) subject to _Section 6.1(c)_, use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, including to actively
solicit (or cause to be solicited) proxies necessary to obtain the Company
Requisite Vote;  _provided_ that the Company Board may (i) fail to include
the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to stockholders; (ii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable to the stockholders of the Company,
an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) following the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, fail to publish, send
or give to its stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act,
within the ten (10) Business Day period (as specified in Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act) after such tender offer or exchange offer is first published,
sent or given, or subsequently 

 



44  amended in any material respect, a statement recommending that stockholders
reject such tender offer or exchange offer and affirming the Recommendation;
or (iv) formally resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention to
effect any of the foregoing, in each case prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), if (x) (A) a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof and was not
initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in, and did not otherwise
result from a, material violation of _Section 6.1_ is made to the Company and
is not withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) there exists any
event, development, circumstance, change, effect, condition or
occurrence (other than an Acquisition Proposal) that was not known by the
Company Board or, if known, the consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable, as of the date of this Agreement, (y) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a
Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) (A) if such Change of
Recommendation is made in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
complies with the provisions of _Section 6.1(c)_ or (B) if such Change of
Recommendation is not made in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company (x) delivers to Parent a written notice informing Parent that the
Company Board proposes to take such action and the basis of the proposed
action no less than four (4) Business Days before taking such action and (y)
during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engages in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent
so that such event, development, circumstance, change, effect, condition or
occurrence would cease to warrant a Change of Recommendation. The Company
shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if subsequent to the date of this Agreement the
Company Board makes a Change of Recommendation, the Company nevertheless shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of Company Shares for approval and
adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

SECTION 6.4 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
6.4(d)_ and _Section 6.4(e)_, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in taking or causing to be taken, all actions and to use its
reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the most expeditious manner practicable.
Without limiting the foregoing sentence, each party agrees to (i) (A) within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless a later time
is mutually agreed between the Parties), make appropriate filings of
"Notification and Report Forms" pursuant to the HSR Act, (B) as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (unless a later time is mutually
agreed between the Parties), make appropriate filings with appropriate
insurance Governmental Entities and (C) as promptly as practicable and
advisable, after the date of this Agreement, make appropriate filings under
any Healthcare Law that are necessary or advisable in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions 

 



45  contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) as promptly as practicable and
advisable, after the date of this Agreement, prepare and submit all other
filings, notifications, information updates and other presentations required
by or in connection with seeking, and obtain, all consents, approvals,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, non-actions,
waivers, exemptions, Permits, orders, change of ownership approvals or other
authorizations (" _Consents_ ") from any Governmental Entity or other third
party, in each case that are necessary or advisable in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
to assist and cooperate with the other party in connection with the
foregoing; _provided_ that the Company shall have no obligation to amend or
modify any Contract or pay any fee to any third party for the purpose of
obtaining any such Consent, or pay any costs and expenses of any third party
resulting from the process of obtaining such Consent. The Parties shall not,
and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, engage in,
publicly propose or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to (x) result in any material delay in the obtaining or materially
increase the risk of not obtaining any required Consent from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering a Legal
Restraint prohibiting or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that
nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of (I) the parties to
acquire prescription and customer records in connection with "file buy"
acquisitions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and (II) Parent or its subsidiaries to (i) take the actions set forth on
_Section 6.4(a)(i)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) take the actions
with respect to commercial Contracts described on _Section 6.4(a)(ii)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, (iii) engage in or enter into any agreement
providing for any acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, business
combination or otherwise) of the assets or equity interests of any Person that
does not engage in commerce or affect commerce in the U.S. or (iv) following
the seven (7) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, engage in or
enter into any agreement providing for any acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, business combination or otherwise) of the assets or equity
interests of any Person, other than an acquisition of Retail Pharmacies (any
such transaction described in this clause (iv), a " _Parent Permitted
Transaction_ ") (it being understood that a transaction described in clause
(I) or (II) (i) through (iii) above that also would fall within the
description in this clause (iv) shall not be considered a Parent Permitted
Transaction); and, notwithstanding anything set forth in the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall permit Parent to enter into a Parent
Permitted Transaction that would materially and adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing (or alternative
financing in lieu thereof). Nothing in the foregoing sentence limits,
modifies, waives, amends or otherwise adversely affects the Companys rights
under _Section 6.4(d)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of any of its
representations and warranties in _Article III_ or its obligations under
_Section 5.1_, or to have failed to satisfy the closing conditions set forth
in  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, to the extent such breach or
failure is the result of, or attributable to, the entry by Parent into or the
consummation by Parent of any, or any plans announced by Parent to enter into
any specific, Parent Permitted Transaction, _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such breach or failure shall be deemed to have resulted
from, or be attributable to, a Parent Permitted Transaction solely on the
basis that, but for the occurrence of such Parent Permitted Transaction, the
Closing would have occurred prior to the date of such breach or failure.

 



46 (b) Subject to _Section 6.4(d)_ and _Section 6.4(e)_, each of Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall in connection with
the reasonable best efforts referenced in _Section 6.4(a)_ and _Section
6.4(c)_, as applicable, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other and
their respective Representatives in connection with any filing or submission
and in connection with any Proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity,
including any Proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform
the other party and/or its counsel, and provide copies, of any substantive
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entity or
such private party, in each case regarding any such filing, submission,
Proceeding or the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) comply, as early as
practicable and advisable, with any request for additional information,
documents or other materials received by such Party or any of its subsidiaries
from the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity; (iv) not directly
or indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act except with the
prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); (v) permit the other party and/or its
counsel to review and discuss reasonably in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party and/or its counsel in connection with, any
proposed substantive communication to be given by it to the DOJ, the FTC or
any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Proceeding by
such private party, any other person; and (vi) to the extent not prohibited
by the DOJ, the FTC or such other Governmental Entity, give the other party
and/or its counsel reasonable advance notice of any in-person meeting, and any
conference call that is initiated by such Party or scheduled in advance, with
such Governmental Entity or such private party and not participate
independently therein without first giving the other party and/or its counsel
reasonable opportunity to attend and participate therein or, in the event
such other party and/or its counsel does not attend or participate therein,
consulting with such other party and/or its counsel reasonably in advance and
considering in good faith the views of such other party and/or its counsel in
connection therewith. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 6.4(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel (or previously agreed outside
consultant, as applicable) of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by
such outside counsel (or previously agreed outside consultant, as applicable)
to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the
Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Materials provided by a
Party to the other Party pursuant to this _Section 6.4(b)_ may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 6.4(d)_ and _Section 6.4(e)_, in the event that any
Proceeding is commenced or threatened by a Governmental Entity or other
Person challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in all material respects with each other in connection therewith and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) contest, resist, oppose and resolve
any such Proceeding; and (ii) avoid the entry of or have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Legal Restraint that would reasonably be expected
to prevent, make illegal, prohibit, restrain, enjoin, materially delay or
materially impair consummation of the Merger or the other

 



47  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent necessary to
obtain the requisite Consents of Governmental Entities under _Section 6.4(a)_
or take the other actions contemplated under this _Section 6.4(c)_
sufficiently in advance of the End Date to permit the consummation of the
Merger by the End Date (taking into account any extension), Parent and the
Company shall commence to take the actions contemplated under this _Section
6.4(c)_ no later than ten (10) months after the date of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in each case
to the extent necessary in order to obtain the requisite Consents of
Governmental Entities, Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, (A)
(1) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber,
or hold separate pending any such action, or (2) proffer, propose, negotiate,
offer to effect or consent, commit or agree to any sale, lease, licensing,
transfer, disposal, divestiture, or other encumbrance of, or hold separate,
in each case before or after the Effective Time, the assets, licenses,
properties, businesses and interests of Parent, the Company and any of their
respective subsidiaries and (B) take or agree to take any other action, and
agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with
respect to, or its ability to own, control, retain or make changes in, the
assets, licenses, properties, businesses and interests of Parent, the Company
and any of their respective subsidiaries or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation (each action under
clause (A) (1) or (2) or clause (B), a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_
that (i), with respect to any sale, transfer, disposition, divestiture or hold
separate of any retail stores of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to (x) sell, transfer, dispose of, divest or hold separate, or (y)
proffer, propose, negotiate, offer to effect or consent, commit or agree to
any sale, transfer, disposal, divestiture or hold separate, in each case
before or after the Effective Time, more than an aggregate of 1,000 retail
stores of Parent and its subsidiaries and the Company and its subsidiaries and
(ii) with respect to any Divestiture Action not described in the preceding
clause (i), Parent will not be required to take such other Divestiture Action
other than (a) the actions set forth on _Section 6.4(d)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and (b) such Divestiture Actions as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in an impact exceeding $100 million
in the aggregate (without taking into account any impact arising from or
relating to any action set forth on  _Section 6.4(d)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule) as a result of (x) the divestiture of non-earnings
generating assets, properties or businesses, in each case with such impact
calculated as the fair market value of such assets, properties or businesses
so divested or (y) the divestiture of earnings generating assets, properties
or businesses, or any other adverse impact on the assets, businesses,
liabilities or financial condition of Parent, the Company or their respective
subsidiaries (including, with respect to Parent, the Surviving Corporation),
in each case with such impact calculated by multiplying any reduction of
Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis resulting therefrom by twelve (12) (any or
all of the actions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this proviso, a "
_Required Antitrust Action_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that, as between
Parent and the Company, Parent shall determine in its sole discretion
the retail stores of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries to be so sold, transferred, disposed of, divested, held separate
or subject to any restriction or limitation; _provided_ , _further_ , that
nothing in this  _Section 6.4_ or otherwise shall obligate Parent to agree
to any Divestiture Action not conditioned upon the Closing or the satisfaction
or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions
to Closing (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) in a case where the Closing will occur immediately
following consummation of

 



48  such Divestiture Action; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that a
Parent Permitted Transaction has been entered into or consummated, any
remedies requested or required by any Governmental Entity as a result of or
that relate to such Parent Permitted Transaction that are taken by Parent
shall not be considered in determining whether the Required Antitrust Action
threshold has been met. Upon Parents reasonable request, the Company shall,
and shall cause its subsidiaries to, (i) reasonably assist Parent in any sales
process (including through facilitation of reasonable due diligence) with
potential purchasers of any of the Companys or its subsidiaries businesses
or other assets proposed by Parent to be subject to any Divestiture Action and
(ii) enter into one or more agreements to be entered into by any of them prior
to the Closing with respect to any Divestiture Action (each, a " _Company
Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such agreement with
respect to a Company Divestiture Action shall become effective until the
Effective Time. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Representatives to, agree to any Divestiture Action without the prior written
consent of Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the matters covered in this _Section 6.4_, it is agreed that Parent shall
make all strategic decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and other
proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that
may be made by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers
that may be sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including determining
the strategy for contesting, litigating or otherwise responding to objections
to, or Proceedings challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case subject to good
faith consultations with the Company reasonably in advance and consideration
of the Companys views and subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4(b)_. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, make
any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations
or discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent.

SECTION 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
each give prompt notice to the other Party of (a) any written notice or other
written communication received from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any other
Person, in each case alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Merger, and (b) any Proceedings commenced or,
to the Companys or Parents knowledge, respectively, threatened, which relate
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, in each case of
clauses (a) and (b) other than with respect to Antitrust Laws, which are the
subject of _Section 6.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not (i) affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement or (ii)
limit the remedies available to the Party receiving such notification.

SECTION 6.6 _Access to Information and Cooperation; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice from Parent, the Company
shall, and shall

 



49  use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries, officers,
directors and employees to, afford the officers, employees, auditors and other
authorized representatives of Parent reasonable access, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, to its officers, employees, properties, offices,
other facilities and books and records (including personnel records). Any such
access shall be at reasonable times during normal business hours and under
supervision of a designee of the Company, at the Companys discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any such access shall be in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to provide access where the Company determines
in its reasonable judgment that such access would be reasonably likely to (A)
result in the loss of the protection of any attorney-client or other
privilege held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) violate any
applicable Law or (C) breach any binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any
third party, _provided_ that the Company shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of this clause would apply.

 

(b) With respect to the access granted pursuant to this _Section 6.6_, each
of Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, comply with the terms and conditions of (i) that certain
letter agreement, dated March 3, 2015, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and (ii) the Clean Room
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, following prior notice
and consultation with the Company, disclose to potential purchasers of any of
the Companys or Parents or their respective subsidiaries businesses or
other assets in connection with any Divestiture Action or Company Divestiture
Action (other than any strategic competitors of the Company) and any
representatives of such potential purchasers, such confidential information
reasonably related to such businesses or assets to be divested pursuant
thereto, subject, to the extent necessary or reasonably advisable, to
appropriate "clean room" arrangements on terms comparable to the terms of the
Clean Room Agreement.

SECTION 6.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting of the Company
Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.8 _Publicity_. Following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall issue an initial joint press release agreed upon by Parent
and the Company regarding the Merger and thereafter neither the Company nor
Parent shall issue any press releases or otherwise make public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the other Partys prior consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in each case except as such
release or announcement may be required by Law or by the rules or regulations
of any United States securities exchange to which the relevant Party is
subject, in which case such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other Party in advance of such release or announcement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the

 



50  restrictions in this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any communication
made by any Party regarding an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of
Recommendation or in connection with any Proceeding in which the Parties are
adverse to each other.

SECTION 6.9 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if shorter, during an employees
period of employment following the Closing Date), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries who are not represented by a labor organization
and who continue to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or
any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (the " _Continuing Non-Union Employees_
"), (i) the same base salary and wage rate as the base salary and wage rate
provided to such Continuing Non-Union Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) employee incentive compensation opportunities which are
no less favorable in the aggregate than the incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such Continuing Non-Union Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate (including with respect to the
proportion of employee cost) to the employee benefits provided to such
Continuing Non-Union Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Commencing on the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall observe the
terms of all existing Collective Bargaining Agreements that govern the wages,
hours and other terms and conditions of employment of employees of the Company
or its subsidiaries who are covered by such Collective Bargaining Agreements
and who continued to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (the " _Continuing Union-Represented
Employees_ ").

(b) (i) For the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to the
Continuing Non-Union Employees, severance benefits which are no less favorable
than those set forth in _Section 6.9(b)_(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
terms, all Company Plans set forth in  _Section 6.9(b)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Company Agreement_ "); _provided_ that nothing
herein shall prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any such Company Agreement in accordance with its terms. Parent and the
Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Closing shall constitute a "
_Change in Control_ " for purposes of all Company Stock Plans, Company Plans
and related trusts set forth in  _Section 6.9(b)_(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the
Continuing Non-Union Employees or Continuing Union-Represented Employees
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") participate (the " _Parent
Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of
benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting,
accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of or entitlement
to pension benefits, post-employment or retiree welfare benefits, special or
early retirement programs or window separation programs), service with the
Company and its subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company

 



51  provides or has recognized past service credit) shall be treated as service
with Parent and its subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall waive
eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations to the
extent waived or not included under the corresponding Company Plan. Parent
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to give or cause its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to give the
Continuing Employees credit under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid
prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs under a corresponding Company Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, no later than thirty (30) days
after the date hereof, the Company shall provide to Parent a schedule of all
Company employees that sets forth the following information with respect to
each individual listed: (i) the base compensation (salary or wage rate), and
bonus; (ii) the title, position and/or job classification, date of hire,
credited service or seniority, (iii) full time versus part time status, active
or leave status; (iv) location of each employee; and (v) a statement of the
Companys classification of each such position or job as exempt or non-exempt
for purposes of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Such schedule shall be
true and complete as of the date or dates set forth on the schedule, each of
which shall be no more than ten (10) days prior to the date of delivery.
Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and Affiliates to: (A) not
disclose such information to any third parties, (B) limit the distribution of
such information within Parent to those with a legitimate need for such
information and (C) not use such scheduled information to solicit or hire any
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, comply in
all material respects with each of their respective obligations under
applicable Law before the Closing Date to inform and consult (or otherwise),
under applicable Law and the terms of any Collective Bargaining Agreements
that govern the wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment
of employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, with any labor organizations
with respect to any Continuing Union-Represented Employees affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates
to continue to honor all Collective Bargaining Agreements until their
respective expiration, modification or amendment. To the extent required by
Law or any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement, Parent shall assume or
become party to any Collective Bargaining Agreements effective upon the
Closing.

 

(g) At Parents request, the Company Board shall adopt resolutions providing
that no rights to contributions will accrue after, and that all of the
Company Plans sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that are defined contribution plans intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Company
401(k) Plans_ ") shall be terminated, as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date (but conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing). The Company and
Parent shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing with respect to the
preparation and execution of all documentation necessary to effect the
foregoing termination, and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all such documentation. To the extent
that the Company 401(k) Plans 

 



52  are terminated pursuant to Parents request, the Continuing Employees shall
be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
any Affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.9_
shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of
any Company Plan, Parent Plan or any other employee benefit plan, (ii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or
terminating any Company Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create
any third-party rights in any current or former service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

SECTION 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer and employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in
each case, when acting or having acted in such capacity), determined as of the
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, arbitration, proceeding, investigation, mediation, consent
decree, audit or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative and whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "),
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under
applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent governing documents,
of any of the Companys subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements with
any directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the provisions in the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors, officers and employees shall be no less favorable to such
directors, officers and employees than such provisions contained in the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws in effect
immediately before the Effective Time.

 



53 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted and, if the
Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of

Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, that shall be from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date hereof

_D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage (including terms
relating thereto) that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated thereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company expend, or shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend, for such policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of
three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, (1) the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage
(including terms relating thereto) that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (2)
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with
benefits and levels of coverage (including terms relating thereto) that are at
least as favorable as the Companys existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the best
available coverage for a cost not exceeding such amount. The Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of not less than six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time. 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs, successors and representatives.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this  _Section 6.10_ shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the under

incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent governing documents, of any of the
Companys subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

joint defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
consult with the Company regarding, and participate in the defense of, any
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions

the Company or any member of the Company Board after the date of this

 



54  Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the " _Transaction Litigation_ ")

necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to, or resulting
from, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, use its and their respective commercially

notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the Company Credit
Agreements and using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff

the manner contemplated by, this _Section 6.14_ and _Section 6.15_ hereof,
and give any other necessary notices to allow for the payoff, discharge and

respect to any series of Company Notes or the Company Credit Agreements,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to make any

applicable premiums or consent payments (other than with respect to scheduled
payments of principal and interest) unless the Parent has irrevocably
deposited funds sufficient to cover such amounts with the applicable trustee
or agent, (iii) require the Company or its subsidiaries to take any action
that would reasonably be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company
after consultation with its legal counsel, to conflict with, or result in any

of confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof) binding on
the Company or its subsidiaries ( _provided_ that in the event that the

contemplated to be provided by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ shall, to the extent such
information constitutes material non-public information of the Company, only

Person affirmatively agrees to maintain the confidentiality of such
information pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and to comply
with all federal and state securities laws and regulations applicable to such
information or (vi) require the Company or any subsidiary thereof to incur
additional indebtedness (including guarantees), such that the Company is
unable to satisfy any applicable debt incurrence requirement at Closing in the
merger covenant in the Indentures.

 

(b) On or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the agent under
each Company Credit Agreement to deliver to Parent a copy of a draft payoff
letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent) with respect to
each Company Credit Agreement (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ " and collectively,
the " _Payoff Letters_ "), in customary form, which Payoff Letters shall (i)
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any

Company Credit Agreement, the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (ii) state that upon
receipt of the Payoff Amount under each such Payoff Letter, the related
Company Credit Agreement and all related loan documents shall be terminated

obligations 

 



57  shall be, released and terminated upon the payment of each Payoff Amount on
the Closing Date (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent and the
filing of appropriate UCC-3 termination statements and other termination
filings). In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the covenants set forth
in _Section 6.18_, Parent shall be unconditionally obligated to provide to
the Company, or to cause the payment of, the Payoff Amount required under
each Payoff Letter substantially simultaneously with the Closing.

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent such costs,

the obligations under this _Section 6.14_, and Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by them to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs or expenses arose out of the actions taken by the
Company, its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.14_ (other than information provided by the Company, its
subsidiaries or Representatives in writing for express use therein), except
in the event such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, costs or expenses are determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

 

SECTION 6.15 _Debt Offers_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
commence offers to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such
term is defined in the applicable Indenture), redeem or exchange, and to
conduct consent solicitations with respect to, any or all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount and all other amounts due of any or all series of
the notes of the Company set forth in _Section 6.15_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Notes_ "), on such terms and conditions,
including pricing terms and amendments to the terms and provisions of the
applicable Indenture, that are specified, from time to time, by Parent
following consultation with the Company and its legal counsel (each, a "
_Debt Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee to agree to proceed
with the redemption of each series of Company Notes specified by Parent
pursuant to their terms at least forty-five (45) days (or such shorter period
as such trustee may agree to) before the expected redemption date, which
notices to holders may be issued before the Effective Time solely to the
extent such redemption is conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time
and such condition is permitted under the applicable Indenture governing the
series of Company Notes that are the subject of such redemption, as reasonably
determined by the Company after consultation with its legal counsel, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee to provide such notice
to holders of such Company Notes as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (if not issued earlier as contemplated by this _Section
6.15(a)_); (iii) provide Parent the reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on each of the notices and other documents contemplated by this
_Section 6.15(a)_ reasonably in advance of their delivery (other than
Exchange Act reports filed in the ordinary course of business of the

 



58  Company and incorporated therein by reference therein and not filed or
furnished in connection with such Debt Offer) and, after review and
consultation, to accept such comments, in all material respects, except to
the extent they are not reasonable; _provided_ that the Company will provide
Parent all such documents without the Parent being required to request such
documents; (iv) take all reasonably necessary actions to deregister the
Company and its securities in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations under the Exchange Act, on such terms and conditions that are
specified, from time to time, by Parent following consultation with the
Company and its legal counsel; and (v) take all other actions and prepare and
deliver all other documents (including any officers certificates and legal
opinions) as may be reasonably required under the applicable Indenture (A) to
issue a notice of redemption of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the applicable series of Company Notes (together with all accrued and unpaid
interest and applicable premiums or consent payments related to such series of
Company Notes) pursuant to the applicable provisions of the applicable
Indentures; _provided_ , _however_ , that such notice shall not be required to
be issued by the Company prior to the Effective Time unless the redemption
provided for in such notice is conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective
Time and such condition is permitted under the applicable Indenture governing
the series of Company Notes that are the subject of such redemption as
determined by the Company after consultation with its legal counsel, and (B)
to take such actions as are necessary to cause the satisfaction and discharge
of the applicable Indentures and such series of Company Notes substantially
concurrently with the Closing (subject to the irrevocable deposit by Parent
with the applicable trustee on the Closing Date of funds sufficient to pay in
full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, accrued and unpaid
interest through the redemption date on, and applicable premiums or consent
payments related to, such series of Company Notes, as arranged by Parent).
Parent shall assist the Company in connection with the foregoing; _provided_
that, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company or the Companys counsel
shall provide all legal opinions required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 6.15_ but, in the case of a redemption or
satisfaction and discharge, only to the extent such notice of redemption is
issued or such satisfaction and discharge is consummated, as applicable, on
or prior to the Closing Date, it being understood that Parents counsel shall
provide all legal opinions required in connection therewith to the extent
required after the Closing Date. Subject to the preceding sentence, the
Company shall provide, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Debt Offers and any redemption or satisfaction and discharge. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or its legal counsel be required
to give an opinion or negative assurance letter with respect to a Debt Offer
or otherwise that in the opinion of the Company or its legal counsel does not
comply with applicable Laws or court decisions, an opinion with respect to
financing by the Parent or the discharge or defeasance of any Company Notes.
The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing that after consultation with its
legal counsel the Company determines can be legally waived (other than that
the Merger shall have been consummated and there shall be no restriction in
effect that prevents the consummation of the Merger) and shall not, without
the written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any material changes
to the Debt Offers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 6.15_, (i) Parent may, by written notice to the Company,
require the Company to extend the offer period and consent period applicable
to a Debt Offer to a date selected by Parent, _provided_ that Parent

 



59  delivers such written notice reasonably in advance of the time at which the
Company is required to provide notice of such extension to holders of the
applicable Company Notes and (ii) in no event shall the Company be required
to commence or settle any Debt Offer, make any related consent payment or
effect any Discharge prior to the Effective Time unless the Company is
satisfied that Parent has sufficient cash or cash equivalents, including
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, to satisfy any obligations of the
Company to the Companys debt holders that may arise as a result of such Debt
Offer or Discharge, including any principal, interest, applicable premiums
or consent payments.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent
solicitation expiration date, if any, assuming the requisite consents are
received in any consent solicitation constituting part of the Debt Offer, each
of the Company and its applicable subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable trustee to),
execute supplemental indentures to the applicable Indenture, which
supplemental indentures shall, subject to the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, implement the amendments described
in the offer to purchase or exchange, consent solicitation statement, related
letter of transmittal, and other related documents; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors or other representatives, have any obligation
to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that would
become effective prior to the Effective Time. The Company makes no
representation or covenant with respect to the applicable trustees
interpretation of _Marblegate Asset Management v. Education Management Corp._
, 14 Civ. 8584 (KPF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 2014).

 

(c) The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers shall be selected by
Parent after consultation with the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 6.15(b)_, the Company shall enter into customary agreements
(including indemnities, which shall be subject to _Section 6.15(d)_) with
such parties and on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to both the
Parent and the Company.

(d) Parent shall make available to the Company on or prior to the Effective
Time all funds necessary to satisfy any obligations of the Company to the
Companys debt holders that may arise as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 6.15_, including (i) any funds necessary to
complete the Discharge of any Company Notes and (ii) principal, interest, any
applicable premiums or consent payments, in connection with any Debt Offer
that is commenced or settled on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with this _Section 6.15_. Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) to the
extent such costs, fees and expenses are incurred by the Company, its
subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with it
complying with its obligations under this _Section 6.15_, and Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries and
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by them to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs or expenses arose out of the actions taken by the
Company, its subsidiaries or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section
6.15_ (other than information provided in writing by the Company or its
subsidiaries

 



60  or Representatives), except in the event such losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses are determined by a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen out of or resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.15_ shall
require the Companys cooperation to the extent it would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the ordinary conduct of the business or operations of the Company or
its subsidiaries, (ii) require the Company or its subsidiaries to agree to pay
any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any
indemnities prior to the Effective Time unless Parent reimburses or is
required to reimburse or indemnify the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise agrees to do so, _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to any series of Company Notes or the Company Credit Agreements,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to make any
payments of outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and/or
applicable premiums or consent payments (other than with respect to scheduled
payments of principal and interest) unless the Parent has irrevocably
deposited funds sufficient to cover such amounts with the applicable trustee
or agent, (iii) require the Company or its subsidiaries to take any action
that would reasonably be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
after consultation with its legal counsel, to conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any applicable Laws, order or any Contract of the
Company, (iv) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be
breached or become inaccurate, cause any condition to the Closing to fail to
be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or (v) cause the
Discharge of any Company Notes in the event the Merger is not consummated.

(f) None of the information supplied by the Company and its subsidiaries for
inclusion in the information provided to holders in connection with a Debt
Offer will contain at the time delivered, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(g) The Company covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, cause or permit any Registration Statement on Form
S-4 or Form S-3 with the SEC in respect of any series of Company Notes to be
declared effective by the SEC or conduct an exchange offer with respect
thereto. Parent shall, upon written request of the Company (and no earlier
than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date for any such payment),
reimburse the Company for any additional interest on any series of Company
Notes resulting from the Companys compliance with the terms of this _Section
6.15(g)_. 

SECTION 6.16 _Anti-Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition", "business combination" or other similar
antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under any federal, state, local or
foreign Laws applicable to the Company is, or will be, applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant all such approvals and take all such
actions within their control as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



61 SECTION 6.17 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause all directors of the Company and, as
specified by Parent reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of
each subsidiary of the Company, in each case, to execute and deliver a letter
effecting his or her resignation as a director (but not as an employee and
without prejudice to such persons rights as an employee) of such entity
effective at the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.18 _Parent and Merger Sub Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.18(c)_, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions and do,
or cause to be done, such things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to enforce in all material respects
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed with respect to any material developments concerning the
status of the Debt Financing and shall promptly respond to any written
requests from the Company concerning such status. Parent agrees to notify the
Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, after Parent
has knowledge thereof, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the commitments with respect to the Debt
Financing thereunder or any definitive financing agreement entered into in
replacement of all or a portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable, shall expire or be terminated (except, in
either case, in accordance with its terms or unless concurrently replaced by
commitments from other financing sources or from proceeds of other sources of
financing or cash or otherwise in accordance with the terms of  _Section
6.18(c)_), (ii) for any reason, all or a portion of the Debt Financing under
the Debt Commitment Letter becomes unavailable (except in accordance with its
terms or unless concurrently replaced by commitments from other financing
sources or from proceeds of other sources of financing or cash or otherwise in
accordance with the terms of _Section 6.18(c)_) or (iii) any Financing Source
or any other Person that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter breaches,
defaults or repudiates the Debt Commitment Letter or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatens in writing to do any of the foregoing and which breach,
default or repudiation would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
conditionality, timing, availability or amount of the Debt Financing. If
Parent becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable under the Debt Commitment Letter, except in accordance with the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or unless concurrently replaced by
commitments from other financing sources or from proceeds of other sources of
financing or cash or otherwise in accordance with the terms of _Section
6.18(c)_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (and Parent shall not agree or consent to such Debt
Financing becoming unavailable except as permitted under _Section 6.18(c)_).

 

(b) In the event (x) the Debt Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Equity
Financing) or any portion thereof is funded in advance of the Closing Date or
(y) net cash proceeds are received by Parent or any subsidiary thereof in
connection with any Divestiture Action, then Parent, Merger Sub or any other
applicable subsidiary thereof shall keep and maintain at all times prior to
the Closing Date the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any

 



62  Permanent Financing or Equity Financing) or any such net cash proceeds from
such Divestiture Action, as well as the amount of cash set forth on _Section
6.18(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, available for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that if
the terms of the Debt Financing (or any Permanent Financing or Equity
Financing) require the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any Permanent
Financing or Equity Financing) to be held in escrow (or similar arrangement)
pending the consummation of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, then such proceeds may be held in escrow, so long as
the conditions to the release of such funds are no more onerous to the Parent
than the conditions to borrowing of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.18(c)_, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification, termination or reduction of, or grant any waiver of, any
condition, remedy or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter without
the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, supplement,
modification, termination, reduction or waiver would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand any of the conditions to the funding of the
Debt Financing, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
obtain the Debt Financing or (iv) materially adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 6.18(c)_ or in _Section 6.18(a)_ to the contrary, Parent or Merger
Sub may (w) amend, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement, (x) enter into other debt financing arrangements and thereby reduce
all or a portion of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing by the amount
of, or the amount of any commitment (including pursuant to working capital
facilities) for, any such debt financing so long as the conditions to funding
under such debt financing arrangements satisfy clause (ii) above (as
determined by the Parent in good faith) (any such debt financing, a "
_Permanent Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ "), (y) reduce and/or replace the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing by the net proceeds raised by Parent and/or any of its subsidiaries
through any Equity Financing and (z) reduce and/or replace the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing by the amount (A) of other available sources of
cash in excess of the amount set forth on _Section 6.18(c)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule held on the balance sheet and otherwise available to fund
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as determined by Parent
in good faith), including, without limitation, net proceeds from Divestiture
Actions received at or prior to such reduction or replacement, drawings under
working capital facilities, the issuance of commercial paper or externally
generated cash flow or (B) equal to the aggregate principal amount of Company
Notes outstanding following the completion or waiver of a change of control
offer pursuant to the applicable Indenture, where such remaining Company Notes
are intended to remain outstanding following the Closing. Upon any amendment,
supplement, modification, termination, reduction or waiver of the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 6.18(c)_ or any
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with _Section
6.18(a)_, (i) references herein to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
document as amended, supplemented, modified, terminated, reduced or waived in
compliance with this _Section 6.18(c)_ or replaced in accordance with
_Section 6.18(a)_ and (ii) references to "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended, supplemented,
modified or waived in 

 



63  compliance with this _Section 6.18(c)_. To the extent that, after giving
effect to any reductions contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, no
commitments remain outstanding under the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent may
terminate the Debt Commitment Letter.

invoked prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by Parent or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity shall have issued a Legal Restraint which prevents, makes
illegal, prohibits, restrains or enjoins the consummation of the Merger and
such Legal Restraint is or shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

such Legal Restraint;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before October 27, 2016 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ that

_Section 7.3_ have been satisfied (or, with respect to the conditions that

if the Closing would have occurred) or remain capable of being satisfied but
any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1(b)_ and/or _Section
7.1(c)_ has not been satisfied, then either Parent or the Company may extend
the End Date to January 27, 2017 by delivery of written notice of such
extension to the other party not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the End Date, in which case the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to
be such later date;

 

(d) by written notice of the Company:

 

(i) if there shall have been a breach of any (A) representation or warranty or
(B) covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement, or any such representation or warranty shall have become
inaccurate, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy has
not been cured within thirty (30) days after

 



66  the receipt of notice thereof or such breach or inaccuracy is not reasonably
capable of being cured within such period; _provided_ that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 

(ii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in
accordance with, and subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of,
_Section 6.1(c)_;

(e) by written notice of Parent if:

 

(i) there shall have been a breach of any (A) representation or warranty or

Agreement, or any such representation or warranty shall have become
inaccurate, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied, and such breach or inaccuracy has
not been cured within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice thereof or
such breach or inaccuracy is not reasonably capable of being cured within such
period; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is
then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement; or

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have made a Change of Recommendation; or

 

(f) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Requisite Vote shall not
have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of any Party hereto, except as provided in
_Section 6.6(b)_, _Section 6.8_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and
_Article IX_ , which shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall relieve any Party hereto of any liability for
damages resulting from fraud or Willful Breach prior to such termination by
any Party hereto (which the Parties acknowledge and agree shall be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 9.13_
applying the governing Law in accordance with _Section 9.9_), in which case
the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at
law or equity. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger
Subs obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent or
Merger Sub obtaining any financing. The failure, for any reason, of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the date that the Closing is required to occur pursuant to 
_Section 1.2_ hereof shall constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) nothing in
this _Section 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their right to
specific performance under _Section 9.12_ and (ii) no termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and Clean Room Agreement.

 



67 (b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_, then the
Company shall pay $325 million (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") to Parent
(or its designee), at or prior to the time of termination and as a condition
to such termination in the case of a termination by the Company or as
promptly as reasonably practicable in the case of a termination pursuant by
Parent (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such
termination), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ or by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and (A) at any time after
the date of this Agreement, but prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting
(in the case of _Section 8.1(f)_), prior to the breach giving rise to such
right of termination (in the case of _Section 8.1(e)(i)_) or prior to such
termination (in the case of  _Section 8.1(c)_), any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise become
publicly known, and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether
consummated), or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not involving the
same Acquisition Proposal as that which was publicly announced or otherwise
became publicly known prior to such termination), then, in any such event,
the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination
Fee, at or prior to the earlier to occur of the Company entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal or the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, references to
"twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)";

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) days after being notified of such by Parent, pay to Parent (or
its designee) all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $45 million, payable
by wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided_ that any amounts
paid under this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ shall be credited (without interest)
against any Company Termination Fee if paid to Parent (or its designee)
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; or

 



68 (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (x)
_Section 8.1(b)_ and the applicable Legal Restraint giving rise to such
termination right is issued under or pursuant to any Antitrust Law or (y)
_Section 8.1(c)_, and, in either case of clause (x) or (y), on the
termination date the only conditions to closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.2_ that have not been satisfied (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at the Closing if the Closing Date were on the
termination date) are the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ (but only
if the applicable Legal Restraint causing such condition not to be satisfied
is issued under or pursuant to any Antitrust Law) and _Section 7.1(c)_, then
Parent shall pay $325 million (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the
Company (or its designee) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by the relevant Party, at or prior to the time of
termination in the case of a termination by Parent, or as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days
following such termination) in the case of a termination by the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of the Parent Termination Fee shall
be increased to $650 million if, following a date that is the seven (7) month
anniversary of the date of this Agreement but prior to the date that is the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, a Parent
Permitted Transaction has been consummated or entered into or Parent has
announced any plans to enter into any specific Parent Permitted Transaction.
The Parties agree that, solely for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(iv), Parent
shall not be deemed to have announced any plans to enter into any specific
Parent Permitted Transaction solely as a result of, following the seven (7)
month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, having engaged or otherwise
participated in any negotiations or discussions concerning such a transaction
or having made any public acknowledgments with respect to such negotiations
or discussions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
agree that, for purposes of this Agreement, Parent shall be deemed to have
announced plans to enter into any specific Parent Permitted Transaction as a
result of having made publicly available a "bear hug" letter, or a tender or
exchange, take-over bid or other public offer to acquire all or a controlling
interest with respect to a Parent Permitted Transaction.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent be required
to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a
Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_,
and the other Party commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the failing Party for the amount set forth in this _Section 8.2_ or a portion
thereof, the failing Party shall pay to the other Party all fees, costs and
expenses of enforcement (including attorneys fees as well as expenses
incurred in connection with any such action), together with interest on such
amount or such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made.

 



69 SECTION 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each
Party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and

SECTION 9.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than with respect to (i) after the Effective
Time, the provisions of _Article II_ (which shall inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, holders of Company Common Stock, Options,
Restricted Shares, Performance

 



79  Units and RSUs, to the extent necessary to receive the consideration due to
such persons thereunder); (ii) after the Effective Time, the provisions of
_Section 6.10_ (which shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
the Indemnified Parties); and (iii) prior to the Closing, the right of the
Company, on behalf of holders of Company Common Stock, Options, Restricted
Shares, Performance Units and RSUs, to pursue claims for damages to such
holders in the event of Parents or Merger Subs fraud or Willful Breach. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources are express
third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on and enforce,
_Section 9.2_, this _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.13_, _Section 9.14_ and
_Section 9.15_.

 

SECTION 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any Proceeding in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the legal relationship of the Parties hereto or thereto (whether at law or
in equity, and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise), shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

 

SECTION 9.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
and the table of contents hereof are included for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.11  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission, email in "portable documentation format"
(".pdf") form, or other electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

SECTION 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either Party has an
adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or

 



80  injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide, furnish or post any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction and each Party hereby irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the provision, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or other security.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.4_.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in  _Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of process
for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 9.13_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Proceeding
is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense
that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any
amount to which the Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any
court having jurisdiction. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, a certified copy
of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.
Without in any way limiting other provision relating to the Financing Sources
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company agrees that
it will not bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim or third party claim of
any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof) and each party hereto further agrees that the adjudication of any
such action, claim or third-party claim shall be governed by and in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

 



81 SECTION 9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THOSE CONTEMPLATED BY THE LAST SENTENCE OF _SECTION 9.13_) OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR
THEREOF.

 

SECTION 9.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced by a Party
against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement, may only be made by a Party, against another Party and no
past, present or future director, officer or employee of any Party shall have
any liability to any Party for any obligations or liabilities of a Party or
for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby. No Financing Source
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company with respect to this
Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action that may arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement. Without limiting the rights of any Party against another
Party hereunder, in no event shall any Party or any of its Affiliates, and
each Party agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Affiliate or stockholder of another Party,
or any director, officer or employee of another Party or of any Affiliates of
another Party.

 

SECTION 9.16 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"hereinafter" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The word "or" shall
not be exclusive. References to "dollars" or "$" are to United States of
America dollars. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule or exhibit but
not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to them as set

time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver of consent and (in the case of statutes,
rules or regulations) by succession or comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein;
_provided_ that, for purposes of any representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or dates, references
to any statute, rule or regulation shall be deemed

 



82  to refer to such statute, rule or regulation, as amended (and, in the case
of statutes, any rules and regulations promulgated under such statutes), in
each case, as of such date. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion
of any specific item in any schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter,
or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business,
and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion of any
specific item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
any schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of
this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in clause (B) of the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" is not intended to imply that such
amount is the appropriate amount for purposes of determining whether any
event, development, circumstance, change, effect, condition, or occurrence
has the effect described in clause (A) thereof, and no Party shall use the

 _C ERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

of

RITE AID CORPORATION

 

The undersigned, in order to form a corporation for the purposes hereinafter
stated, under and pursuant to the provisions of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), hereby certifies that:

FIRST. The name of the Corporation is Rite Aid Corporation.

SECOND. The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is
1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801 and the
name of its registered agent at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

THIRD. The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL or any
successor statute.

 

FOURTH. The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ").

FIFTH. The name and address of the incorporator is Andrew Edelen, 425
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017-3954.

SIXTH. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the
laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors, acting by majority
vote, is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of
the Corporation.

 

SEVENTH. Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws of the Corporation
shall so require, election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.

EIGHTH.

 

A. Modification of Certain Liability of Directors.

 

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate   action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any
repeal or modification of this Section A or B by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

B. Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(1) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person
of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while
serving as a director or officer shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in paragraph (2)
of this Section B with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Section B shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be
paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the DGCL
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in
his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to any employee benefit plan) in
advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director
or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Section B or otherwise.

(2) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under paragraph (1) of this
Section B is not paid in full by the Corporation within the thirty days after
a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be
a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if  any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has
not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(3) _Non Exclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Section B shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

(4) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the DGCL.

NINTH. The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by Section
203 of the DGCL, and the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DCGL
shall not apply to the Corporation.

 

TENTH. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (A)
any "internal corporate claim" within the meaning of the DGCL and (B) (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii)
any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other
wrongdoing by, any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to
the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting
a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended and/or
restated from time to time), (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws (as either may be amended and/or restated from time to time), or (v)
any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in
each case subject to said court having personal jurisdiction over the
indispensable parties named as defendants therein; provided, that, if and only
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in
another state court sitting in the State of Delaware. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article TENTH. ELEVENTH. If any provision or provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any
circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of Incorporation
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby and (ii) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including,
without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of
Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit the Corporation to protect
its directors, officers, employees and agents from personal liability in
respect of their good faith service or for the benefit of the Corporation to
the fullest extent permitted by law.
